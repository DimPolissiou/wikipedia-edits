At this time, he married [[Anni Albers]] (n\u00e9e Fleischmann) who was a student there. His work in [[Dessau#The Bauhaus|Dessau]] included designing furniture and working with glass. As a younger art teacher, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among artists who included [[Oskar Schlemmer]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Paul Klee]].

He also invited important American artists such as [[Willem de Kooning]], to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was \"his own academy\".

Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect [[King-lui Wu]] in creating decorative designs for some of Wu's projects. Among these were distinctive geometric [[fireplaces]] for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the fa\u00e7ade of [[Manuscript Society]], one of Yale's secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces.\n\nIn 1963, he published ''Interaction of Color'' which presented his [[theory]] that colors were governed by an internal and deceptive logic. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 [[silk screen]] plates.  This work has been republished since and is now even available as an iPad App.  Also during this time, he created the abstract [[album covers]] of band leader [[Enoch Light]]'s [[Command LP]] records.

He favored a very disciplined approach to [[composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series, ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored [[Chromaticity|chromatic interactions]] with nested squares. Usually painting on [[Masonite]], he used a [[palette knife]] with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406\u00d7406&nbsp;mm to 1.22\u00d71.22 m.<ref name=\"Josef Albers\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=97 Josef Albers] [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977).jpg|thumb|Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977) in Sydney]]\nIn 1959, a [[gold-leaf]] [[mural]] by Albers, ''Two Structural Constellations'' was engraved in the lobby of the [[Corning Glass|Corning Glass Building]] in [[Manhattan]].

The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign in c. 2000.

Lee attempts to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the [[Weber-Fechner Law]] and simultaneous contrast. In each case Lee suggests that Albers made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. Lee suggests that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). Lee offers that the scientific colour hypothesis of [[Edwin H. Land]] should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, Lee's claims have implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.<ref>Lee, Alan. \"A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color.\" ''Leonardo'' (1981): 99\u2013105.</ref><ref>Jameson, Dorothea. \"Some Misunderstandings about Color Perception, Color Mixture and Color Measurement\". ''Leonardo'', vol. 16, no. 1, 1983, pp. 41\u201342. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1575043.</ref> However, Dorothea Jameson has challenged Lee's criticism of Albers, arguing that Albers' approach toward painting and pedagody emphasized artists' experiences in the handling and mixing of pigments, which often have different results than predicted by color theory experiments with projected light or spinning color disks. Furthermore, Jameson explains that Lee's own understanding of additive and subtractive color mixtures is flawed.<ref>Jameson, Dorothee.

In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored [[Chromaticity|chromatic interactions]] with nested squares. Usually painting on [[Masonite]], he used a [[palette knife]] with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406\u00d7406&nbsp;mm to 1.22\u00d71.22 m.<ref name=\"Josef Albers\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=97 Josef Albers] [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977).jpg|thumb|Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977) in Sydney]]\nIn 1959, a [[gold-leaf]] [[mural]] by Albers, ''Two Structural Constellations'' was engraved in the lobby of the [[Corning Glass|Corning Glass Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. For the entrance of the [[Time-Life Building|Time & Life Building]] lobby, he created ''Two Portals'' (1961), a 42-feet by 14-feet mural of alternating glass bands in white and brown that recede into two [[bronze]] centers to create an illusion of depth.<ref>David W.

The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign in c. 2000.

Lee attempts to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the [[Weber-Fechner Law]] and simultaneous contrast. In each case Lee suggests that Albers made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. Lee suggests that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). Lee offers that the scientific colour hypothesis of [[Edwin H. Land]] should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, Lee's claims have implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.<ref>Lee, Alan. \"A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color.\" ''Leonardo'' (1981): 99\u2013105.</ref><ref>Jameson, Dorothea. \"Some Misunderstandings about Color Perception, Color Mixture and Color Measurement\". ''Leonardo'', vol. 16, no. 1, 1983, pp. 41\u201342. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1575043.</ref> However, Dorothea Jameson has challenged Lee's criticism of Albers, arguing that Albers' approach toward painting and pedagody emphasized artists' experiences in the handling and mixing of pigments, which often have different results than predicted by color theory experiments with projected light or spinning color disks. Furthermore, Jameson explains that Lee's own understanding of additive and subtractive color mixtures is flawed.<ref>Jameson, Dorothee.

The title was won by [[Red Star Belgrade]], the club's 18th in its history. It also turned out to be the last season in which teams from [[SR Croatia]] and [[SR Slovenia]] participated. In 1991 these constituent republics declared their independence from Yugoslavia.\n\nTwo points were awarded for a win, while the tied matches were decided by a penalty shootout with the winner getting a point.\n\nThe first half of the season (the fall part) completed on December 19, 1990, with the postponed week 17 match in Split between Hajduk and Red Star.

All of the Partizan players managed to run away into the dressing room, thus escaping unharmed. While chanting anti-Serb slogans, the violent mob then set fire to the [[Flag of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav flag]] that was displayed on the stadium's official mast. They then proceeded to raise the Croatian chequerboard flag (at the time not in official use and thus considered a Croatian nationalist symbol). At the moment of the incident, Partizan was leading 0-2 courtesy of the [[Milan \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]] brace. The match was never resumed, and eventually registered 0-3 in Partizan's favour.\n\n===Dinamo v. Red Star match-fixing allegations===\nOn Saturday, 18 May 1991, Dinamo Zagreb hosted champions-elect Red Star Belgrade at Maksimir Stadium. The match was of no competitive importance since Red Star already clinched the league title as it prepared to go to Bari some ten days later for the [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]] while Dinamo cemented its hold on the second place that ensured a UEFA Cup spot. However, the match still carried a degree of tension due to pitting a marquee Croatian side versus a marquee Serbian one at a time when ethnic incidents, some of them deadly, started taking place in the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], and especially in light of the fact this was the first time the two teams met at Maksimir following the previous season's violent clashes in the stands that called the match off.\n\nThis time the match began as scheduled and finished without interruption with Red Star going 0-2 in front before Dinamo mounted a spirited come-back for a 3-2 win at full time. However, more than 20 years later, allegations appeared that the match had been fixed via confessions from two of the match's protagonists.\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'' magazine in September 2012, [[Robert Prosine\u010dki]], Red Star midfielder back in 1991, said his team \"let Dinamo win that day\".<ref>[http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/robert-prosinecki--stimac-nema-karizmu Robert Prosine\u010dki: \u0160timac nema karizmu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234052/http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/robert-prosinecki--stimac-nema-karizmu |date=28 September 2012 }};''Globus'', September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.kurir-info.rs/prosinecki-lupa-gluposti-clanak-432774 Zvezda pustila Dinamo 1991.];''Kurir'', 28 September 2012</ref>\n\nPrompted by Prosine\u010dki's claims, [[Ljupko Petrovi\u0107]], Red Star's head coach in 1991, expanded: \"We didn't lose that match by arranging with someone from Dinamo beforehand to let them win. No. We were simply forced into losing by the political circles that wanted to ensure Dinamo's win that day. The war had practically already begun, Croatia was about to declare independence, and the match was taking place only a year after the [[Dinamo Zagreb\u2013Red Star Belgrade riot|previous incident when Zvonimir Boban assaulted a policeman]] - our first away match versus Dinamo since then. I remember that [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] came to the match and watched it from the luxury box with his cronies and that the overall atmosphere within the stadium was extremely hostile such that no result but Dinamo's win was going to be acceptable. We got up 0-2, but towards the end of the first half Dinamo got a penalty on a scandalous and very obvious [[diving (association football)|dive]] by [[Davor \u0160uker]]. Later, they managed to tie the score. At halftime I protested vehemently with the referee, a Montenegrin guy whose name I can't recall at the moment, and from what he told me it was apparent between the lines that it was already decided we had to lose that match for political reasons. Because Tu\u0111man is sitting in the stands and because he doesn't want a Serbian team winning in the middle of Zagreb right in front of his eyes at a time when he's creating an independent state.

All of the Partizan players managed to run away into the dressing room, thus escaping unharmed. While chanting anti-Serb slogans, the violent mob then set fire to the [[Flag of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav flag]] that was displayed on the stadium's official mast. They then proceeded to raise the Croatian chequerboard flag (at the time not in official use and thus considered a Croatian nationalist symbol). At the moment of the incident, Partizan was leading 0-2 courtesy of the [[Milan \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]] brace. The match was never resumed, and eventually registered 0-3 in Partizan's favour.\n\n===Dinamo v. Red Star match-fixing allegations===\nOn Saturday, 18 May 1991, Dinamo Zagreb hosted champions-elect Red Star Belgrade at Maksimir Stadium. The match was of no competitive importance since Red Star already clinched the league title as it prepared to go to Bari some ten days later for the [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]] while Dinamo cemented its hold on the second place that ensured a UEFA Cup spot. However, the match still carried a degree of tension due to pitting a marquee Croatian side versus a marquee Serbian one at a time when ethnic incidents, some of them deadly, started taking place in the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], and especially in light of the fact this was the first time the two teams met at Maksimir following the previous season's violent clashes in the stands that called the match off.\n\nThis time the match began as scheduled and finished without interruption with Red Star going 0-2 in front before Dinamo mounted a spirited come-back for a 3-2 win at full time. However, more than 20 years later, allegations appeared that the match had been fixed via confessions from two of the match's protagonists.\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'' magazine in September 2012, [[Robert Prosine\u010dki]], Red Star midfielder back in 1991, said his team \"let Dinamo win that day\".<ref>[http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/robert-prosinecki--stimac-nema-karizmu Robert Prosine\u010dki: \u0160timac nema karizmu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234052/http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/robert-prosinecki--stimac-nema-karizmu |date=28 September 2012 }};''Globus'', September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.kurir-info.rs/prosinecki-lupa-gluposti-clanak-432774 Zvezda pustila Dinamo 1991.];''Kurir'', 28 September 2012</ref>\n\nPrompted by Prosine\u010dki's claims, [[Ljupko Petrovi\u0107]], Red Star's head coach in 1991, expanded: \"We didn't lose that match by arranging with someone from Dinamo beforehand to let them win. No. We were simply forced into losing by the political circles that wanted to ensure Dinamo's win that day. The war had practically already begun, Croatia was about to declare independence, and the match was taking place only a year after the [[Dinamo Zagreb\u2013Red Star Belgrade riot|previous incident when Zvonimir Boban assaulted a policeman]] - our first away match versus Dinamo since then. I remember that [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] came to the match and watched it from the luxury box with his cronies and that the overall atmosphere within the stadium was extremely hostile such that no result but Dinamo's win was going to be acceptable. We got up 0-2, but towards the end of the first half Dinamo got a penalty on a scandalous and very obvious [[diving (association football)|dive]] by [[Davor \u0160uker]]. Later, they managed to tie the score. At halftime I protested vehemently with the referee, a Montenegrin guy whose name I can't recall at the moment, and from what he told me it was apparent between the lines that it was already decided we had to lose that match for political reasons. Because Tu\u0111man is sitting in the stands and because he doesn't want a Serbian team winning in the middle of Zagreb right in front of his eyes at a time when he's creating an independent state. I got thrown out of the match, we conceded once more, we lost the match and that's the whole story\".<ref>[http://sport.blic.rs/Fudbal/Domaci-fudbal/221112/Ljupko-Petrovic-Zvezda-je-1991-morala-da-pusti-Dinamo-zbog-Tudjmana Ljupko Petrovi\u0107: Zvezda je 1991. morala da pusti Dinamo zbog Tu\u0111mana!];''Blic'', 28 September 2012</ref>\n\n==League table==\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WL OT\n|show_limit=5\n|res_col_header=QR\n|showOTwin=no|showOTloss=no\n|showPKwin=yes|showPKloss=yes\n|team1=RSB|name_RSB=[[Red Star Belgrade]]\n|team2=DZA|name_DZA=[[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]\n|team3=PAR|name_PAR=[[FK Partizan|Partizan]]\n|team4=PRO|name_PRO=[[FK Proleter Zrenjanin|Proleter Zrenjanin]]\n|team5=BOR|name_BOR=[[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]]\n|team6=HSP|name_HSP=[[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]\n|team7=VOJ|name_VOJ=[[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]]\n|team8=RAD|name_RAD=[[FK Rad|Rad]]\n|team9=OSI|name_OSI=[[NK Osijek|Osijek]]\n|team10=RNI|name_RNI=[[FK Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161|Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161]]\n|team11=SAR|name_SAR=[[FK Sarajevo|Sarajevo]]\n|team12=VEL|name_VEL=[[FK Vele\u017e Mostar|Vele\u017e]]\n|team13=ZEM|name_ZEM=[[FK Zemun|Zemun]]\n|team14=OLI|name_OLI=[[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1945)|Olimpija]]\n|team15=RIJ|name_RIJ=[[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]]\n|team16=\u017dEL|name_\u017dEL=[[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar]]\n|team17=BUD|name_BUD=[[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]\n|team18=SLO|name_SLO=[[FK Sloboda Tuzla|Sloboda Tuzla]]\n|team19=SPA|name_SPA=[[FK Spartak Subotica|Spartak Subotica]]\n|win_RSB=25|PKTwin_RSB=4|PKloss_RSB=2|loss_RSB=5|gf_RSB=88|ga_RSB=35|status_RSB=C\n|win_DZA=20|PKwin_DZA=6|PKloss_DZA=4|loss_DZA=6|gf_DZA=72|ga_DZA=36|note_DZA=After the season, Croatian and Slovenian clubs left the Yugoslav federation and formed their own leagues.

{"title_page": "History of Beltola", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2017}}\n'''Beltola''' is a prime residential area in the southern part of [[Guwahati]], [[Assam]]. It is an adjoining area of the [[Dispur]] Capital Complex, the capital of Assam. Though most of the buildings and roads were newly constructed, Beltola has a long history which dates back mythical ages. During Ahom reign, Beltola was a small Koch kingdom, whose ruler assisted in the  administration of the [[Borphukan]] in [[Guwahati]], the [[Ahom people|Ahom]] Viceroy of [[Lower Assam]] and in maintaining relations with the communities of Khasi Hills. The Kingdom of Beltola survives under the British rule and it existed till India's independence in 1947 CE.\n\n==Brief History of Beltola==\n\nNot much is known about the history of Beltola in ancient times. Mythical sources claimed that the word Beltola comes from the word Bilvapatra, which means leaves of [[Aegle marmelos|Bael]] tree, used in religious ceremonies. It was said that in olden day's large quantities of [[Aegle marmelos|Bael]] tree leaves were sent to [[Kamakhya Temple]] to be used in rituals. It was from that time the place is called as Beltola.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 55</ref> [[File:Ganesh Mandir, Ganeshguri, Guwahati.jpg|thumb|Ancient Ganesh temple in Ganeshguri, Beltola Mouza, Guwahati]]The Ganesh Temple located in Ganeshguri, which comes under Beltola Mouza or estate, is also very ancient and not much is known about its origin. Some local sources stated that since Beltola was located in the entrance of the old city of [[Guwahati]] where the famous temple of [[Kamakhya]] is situated, the Ganesh deity at the Ganesh temple in [[Ganeshguri]], serves as a gatekeeper. Therefore, the Ganesh temple may be as ancient as [[Kamakhya]] temple.  This theory was inspired by the mythical story of [[Ganesha]] guarding the entrance of the house, while his mother Devi [[Parvati]] was bathing.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 55</ref>[[File:Basistha Temple, Guwahati.jpg|thumb|Basistha Temple in Basisthashram, Beltola Mouza, Guwahati]]The Basithashram or [[Basistha Temple]] also comes under Beltola  Mouza. Though the [[Basistha Temple]] was constructed by [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahom]] King Swargadeo [[Rajeswar Singha]] in the middle of eighteenth century, the  Basisthashram or the ashram of Basistha dates back to mythical era and it was established by one of the [[Saptarishi]], Rishi [[Vasistha|Basistha]]. It is said that Rishi [[Vasistha|Basistha]] performs religious ceremonies to worship Lord [[Shiva]] in the ashram.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 58</ref>  Early inhabitants of Beltola mainly consist of Garos, Karbis, Lalungs, Rabha and Koch-Kachari, Keot(Kaibarta) while small numbers of Ahoms, Manipuris, Kalitas and Muslims later came and settled in Beltola. No records exist about any rulers of Beltola before '''Gaj Narayan ''' of [[Koch dynasty]]. In 1613 CE, Parikshit Narayan, the ruler of [[Koch Hajo]], was defeated by the Mughals. He was taken prisoner and was  escorted to [[Delhi]] where he had an audience with Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]]. On acknowledging Mughal Supremacy and on the agreement of annual tribute of four lakhs rupees, the Emperor returned his kingdom. While on his way back, Parikshit Narayan fell ill and died. On his death, the Mughals annexed his kingdom and set up [[Hajo]] as their headquarters in [[Assam]].  Bijit Narayan, the young son of Parikshit Narayan was set up as a tributary king of a small state, named after him, called [[Bijni]]. On the defeat of Parikshit Narayan, his two brothers Balinarayan and Gaj Narayan, fled to the [[Ahom Kingdom]] and sought refuge from Ahom King Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]]. Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]] had married the daughter of Parikshit Narayan, Mangaldohi, and later set up the [[Mangaldoi]] town on her respect. Owing to this matrimonial alliance, Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]] granted refuge to these Koch princes. Meanwhile, the Mughal Governor demanded their extradition, which Swargadeo Pratap Singha refused. This and other causes of offence led the Mughal Governor to decide on the invasion of the [[Ahom Kingdom]], leading to Ahom-Mughal conflict. The invading Mughal forces were defeated and driven back to their own territory. After this victory, in 1615 CE Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]] installed Balinarayan as the tributary ruler of [[Darrang district|Darrang]] and renamed him as Dharmanarayan, while his brother Gaj Narayan was set up as a tributary ruler in [[Beltola]].<ref>Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 365</ref><ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 65</ref> Gajnarayan was instructed to administer under the supervision of [[Borphukan]], the Ahom viceroy of [[Lower Assam]].  Gaj Narayan and his descendants ruled [[Beltola]] as a Tributary Chiefs under the Ahom Sovereigns. Treasury records of late [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom]] period showed that the rulers of Beltola used to pay 2500 rupees as annual tribute to the [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom]] Government.<ref>Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha 1975 page 246</ref> After the decline of Ahom supremacy and the fall of [[Ahom Kingdom]] in [[Assam]], Beltola comes under British rule. After occupation of the [[Ahom Kingdom]], the British divided the erstwhile [[Ahom kingdom]] into Mouzas or revenue circle for the purpose of smooth administration. In each Mouza, one Mouzadar was appointed who was entrusted with the task of collecting taxes and administration. The British reduced the status of Beltola from Kingdom to Mouza and that of the ruler from King to Mouzadar, though certain terms were set up in favour of the royal family. Beltola Mouza was specially categorized as Raj Mouza or Principality. The rulers were allowed to retain the title of Raja in their names and the official post of the Mouzadar of Beltola was made hereditary and was reserved for the royal family of [[Beltola]]. After independence of [[India]] from British rule, the Government of India abolished Zamindari or system of land lords in 1956 CE, due to which the royal family of Beltola lost much of their lands. Then in 1974 CE, the Government of India abolished all the special privileges bestowed to former royal families of India. The royal family of Beltola was also affected by these changes and the rank of Beltola Mouza was demoted from Raj Mouza to that of general category Mouza.  The official post of Mouzadar remained with the royal family and till now the post of Mouzadar was held hereditarily by them, though they do not have any power of administration except collecting land taxes for Government of [[Assam]].\n\n==Extent of Beltola Mouza==\n\nDuring the Ahom reign, the kingdom of Beltola extends from the borders of the kingdom of Rani in the west, while in the east it extends to the borders of the kingdom of [[Mayong (Assam)|Mayong]] and Dimorua. The places named as Rajgarh and Hatigarh in present-day Guwahati city, were the borders between Ahom ruled Guwahati city and the kingdom of Beltola. After the fall of [[Ahom kingdom]] and the British occupation of [[Assam]], Beltola lost its status as a kingdom and converted into a Mouza or revenue circle. Under British rule, the size of the Beltola Mouza was much reduced. Presently Beltola Mouza consists of several places of Modern day Guwahati city. Centrally located from Beltola haat or Beltola Bazaar, the Mouza or estate covers the area of Narengi, Birkuchi, Hengrabari, Panjabari, Hatigaon, Bhetapara, Maidam gaon, Rukminigaon, Khanapara, Kahilipara, Ganeshguri and Basistha Mandir. It was said that the Royal residence of the Beltola royal family was in Rukminigaon, while the place where the royal elephants were kept and trained was Hatigaon, literally meaning village of elephants (in Assamese Hati means elephant; gaon means village). Maidam gaon was said to be the place of cremation of the royal family members. The old name of Khanapara was Kainapara. Kaina is a [[Khasi language|Khasi]] word, which means elephant, while Para in Khasi language means human settlements or colony. It was said that the ruler of Beltola used to capture elephants and was indulge in the profitable business of selling elephants. It can be assumed that the Khasi people living in that region were indulged in the capturing elephants for the rulers of [[Beltola]], due to which the name Kainapara or later Khanapara came into existence.

Since their children, two sons and one daughter were in their minor age, the queen undertook to look after the administration of Beltola Mouza. Due to her efficiency in handling the administration, Rani Lakshmipriya Devi became very popular among the people of Beltola. She actively participated in the welfare programs of the people and performs charity in various religious ceremonies.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 19-20</ref> She took utmost care for the educations of her children.

She also worked to protect the rights of indigenous communities in the historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar, when some outside business community tried to expel them. It was partly because of her effort that the historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar still retains the indigenous character of being a meeting point for the people from hills and plains.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 24</ref> Rani Lakshmipriya died in 1991, at the age of 80 years.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 15</ref> Her daughter '''Madhuri Choudhury''' wrote several books on her life and several others on the history of [[Beltola]]. The royal family of Beltola still holds the official post of Mouzadar of Beltola Mouza though they do not have any power of administration except collecting land taxes for Government of [[Assam]].\n\n==Beltola after India\u2019s independence==\nAfter India's independence from British rule, [[Guwahati]] became the prominent city of Assam, but the Beltola Mouza was still not a part of Guwahati city. Beltola and Guwahati were separate places at that time. In 1973 CE, Sarat Chandra Singha, the then Chief Minister of [[Assam]], decided to shift the capital of [[Assam]] from [[Shillong]]. A small village named [[Dispur]] in Beltola Mouza was selected temporarily as the Capital of Assam. After this decision, all the important government offices were shifted to Dispur. People from different parts of Assam came and settled in and around Dispur, quickly converting a rural area, into a thickly populated region. As the year progressed, the city of Guwahati expanded, and Dispur and Beltola became a part of Greater Guwahati city. Dispur became a permanent seat of the Government of Assam and remained as the Capital. Today Beltola and Guwahati are no longer considered as separate places, but rather part of the same city.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

It is an adjoining area of the [[Dispur]] Capital Complex, the capital of Assam. Though most of the buildings and roads were newly constructed, Beltola has a long history which dates back mythical ages. During Ahom reign, Beltola was a small Koch kingdom, whose ruler assisted in the  administration of the [[Borphukan]] in [[Guwahati]], the [[Ahom people|Ahom]] Viceroy of [[Lower Assam]] and in maintaining relations with the communities of Khasi Hills. The Kingdom of Beltola survives under the British rule and it existed till India's independence in 1947 CE.\n\n==Brief History of Beltola==\n\nNot much is known about the history of Beltola in ancient times. Mythical sources claimed that the word Beltola comes from the word Bilvapatra, which means leaves of [[Aegle marmelos|Bael]] tree, used in religious ceremonies. It was said that in olden day\u2019s large quantities of [[Aegle marmelos|Bael]] tree leaves were sent to [[Kamakhya Temple]] to be used in rituals. It was from that time the place is called as Beltola.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 55</ref> [[File:Ganesh Mandir, Ganeshguri, Guwahati.jpg|thumb|Ancient Ganesh temple in Ganeshguri, Beltola Mouza, Guwahati]]The Ganesh Temple located in Ganeshguri, which comes under Beltola Mouza or estate, is also very ancient and not much is known about its origin. Some local sources stated that since Beltola was located in the entrance of the old city of [[Guwahati]] where the famous temple of [[Kamakhya]] is situated, the Ganesh deity at the Ganesh temple in [[Ganeshguri]], serves as a gatekeeper. Therefore, the Ganesh temple may be as ancient as [[Kamakhya]] temple.  This theory was inspired by the mythical story of [[Ganesha]] guarding the entrance of the house, while his mother Devi [[Parvati]] was bathing.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 55</ref>[[File:Basistha Temple, Guwahati.jpg|thumb|Basistha Temple in Basisthashram, Beltola Mouza, Guwahati]]The Basithashram or [[Basistha Temple]] also comes under Beltola  Mouza. Though the [[Basistha Temple]] was constructed by [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahom]] King Swargadeo [[Rajeswar Singha]] in the middle of eighteenth century, the  Basisthashram or the ashram of Basistha dates back to mythical era and it was established by one of the [[Saptarishi]], Rishi [[Vasistha|Basistha]]. It is said that Rishi [[Vasistha|Basistha]] performs religious ceremonies to worship Lord [[Shiva]] in the ashram.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 58</ref>  Early inhabitants of Beltola mainly consist of Garos, Karbis, Lalungs, Rabha and Koch-Kachari, Keot(Kaibarta) while small numbers of Ahoms, Manipuris, Kalitas and Muslims later came and settled in Beltola. No records exist about any rulers of Beltola before '''Gaj Narayan ''' of [[Koch dynasty]]. In 1613 CE, Parikshit Narayan, the ruler of [[Koch Hajo]], was defeated by the Mughals. He was taken prisoner and was  escorted to [[Delhi]] where he had an audience with Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]]. On acknowledging Mughal Supremacy and on the agreement of annual tribute of four lakhs rupees, the Emperor returned his kingdom. While on his way back, Parikshit Narayan fell ill and died. On his death, the Mughals annexed his kingdom and set up [[Hajo]] as their headquarters in [[Assam]].  Bijit Narayan, the young son of Parikshit Narayan was set up as a tributary king of a small state, named after him, called [[Bijni]]. On the defeat of Parikshit Narayan, his two brothers Balinarayan and Gaj Narayan, fled to the [[Ahom Kingdom]] and sought refuge from Ahom King Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]]. Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]] had married the daughter of Parikshit Narayan, Mangaldohi, and later set up the [[Mangaldoi]] town on her respect. Owing to this matrimonial alliance, Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]] granted refuge to these Koch princes. Meanwhile, the Mughal Governor demanded their extradition, which Swargadeo Pratap Singha refused. This and other causes of offence led the Mughal Governor to decide on the invasion of the [[Ahom Kingdom]], leading to Ahom-Mughal conflict. The invading Mughal forces were defeated and driven back to their own territory. After this victory, in 1615 CE Swargadeo [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]] installed Balinarayan as the tributary ruler of [[Darrang district|Darrang]] and renamed him as Dharmanarayan, while his brother Gaj Narayan was set up as a tributary ruler in [[Beltola]].<ref>Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 365</ref><ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 65</ref> Gajnarayan was instructed to administer under the supervision of [[Borphukan]], the Ahom viceroy of [[Lower Assam]].  Gaj Narayan and his descendants ruled [[Beltola]] as a Tributary Chiefs under the Ahom Sovereigns. Treasury records of late [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom]] period showed that the rulers of Beltola used to pay 2500 rupees as annual tribute to the [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom]] Government.<ref>Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha 1975 page 246</ref> After the decline of Ahom supremacy and the fall of [[Ahom Kingdom]] in [[Assam]], Beltola comes under British rule. After occupation of the [[Ahom Kingdom]], the British divided the erstwhile [[Ahom kingdom]] into Mouzas or revenue circle for the purpose of smooth administration. In each Mouza, one Mouzadar was appointed who was entrusted with the task of collecting taxes and administration. The British reduced the status of Beltola from Kingdom to Mouza and that of the ruler from King to Mouzadar, though certain terms were set up in favour of the royal family. Beltola Mouza was specially categorized as Raj Mouza or Principality. The rulers were allowed to retain the title of Raja in their names and the official post of the Mouzadar of Beltola was made hereditary and was reserved for the royal family of [[Beltola]]. After independence of [[India]] from British rule, the Government of India abolished Zamindari or system of land lords in 1956 CE, due to which the royal family of Beltola lost much of their lands. Then in 1974 CE, the Government of India abolished all the special privileges bestowed to former royal families of India. The royal family of Beltola was also affected by these changes and the rank of Beltola Mouza was demoted from Raj Mouza to that of general category Mouza.  The official post of Mouzadar remained with the royal family and till now the post of Mouzadar was held hereditarily by them, though they do not have any power of administration except collecting land taxes for Government of [[Assam]].\n\n==Extent of Beltola Mouza==\n\nDuring the Ahom reign, the kingdom of Beltola extends from the borders of the kingdom of Rani in the west, while in the east it extends to the borders of the kingdom of [[Mayong (Assam)|Mayong]] and Dimorua. The places named as Rajgarh and Hatigarh in present-day Guwahati city, were the borders between Ahom ruled Guwahati city and the kingdom of Beltola. After the fall of [[Ahom kingdom]] and the British occupation of [[Assam]], Beltola lost its status as a kingdom and converted into a Mouza or revenue circle. Under British rule, the size of the Beltola Mouza was much reduced. Presently Beltola Mouza consists of several places of Modern day Guwahati city. Centrally located from Beltola haat or Beltola Bazaar, the Mouza or estate covers the area of Narengi, Birkuchi, Hengrabari, Panjabari, Hatigaon, Bhetapara, Maidam gaon, Rukminigaon, Khanapara, Kahilipara, Ganeshguri and Basistha Mandir. It was said that the Royal residence of the Beltola royal family was in Rukminigaon, while the place where the royal elephants were kept and trained was Hatigaon, literally meaning village of elephants (in Assamese Hati means elephant; gaon means village). Maidam gaon was said to be the place of cremation of the royal family members. The old name of Khanapara was Kainapara. Kaina is a [[Khasi language|Khasi]] word, which means elephant, while Para in Khasi language means human settlements or colony. It was said that the ruler of Beltola used to capture elephants and was indulge in the profitable business of selling elephants. It can be assumed that the Khasi people living in that region were indulged in the capturing elephants for the rulers of [[Beltola]], due to which the name Kainapara or later Khanapara came into existence. Birkuchi name comes from the combination of two words, Bir means heroes and Kuchi means camp. It was said that the Koch army of Chilarai use to camp there for some time and thus the place got its name.\n\n==Koch rulers of Beltola==\n\n*1.

After this tragic incident, Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev abandoned the royal residence considering it as inauspicious. Earlier Pabindra Narayan Dev had borrowed a large sum of money as debt from one of his friend putting the royal residence as security, to guarantee the return of amount. After his death, his friend obtained the permission from British Government and put the royal residence and its articles on lease to get his money back. The royal residence got destroyed in the process.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 51</ref> In 1937 CE, while on a hunting excursion Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev got hit by bullet accidentally and succumb to his wounds, leaving his wife Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and his three minor children, two sons and one daughter.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 49</ref>\n\n*12. '''Rani Lakshmipriya Devi''' (wife of Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev):\n\n[[File:Beltola market.jpg|thumb|Fruits and vegetable market in Historic Beltola Bazaar]] Rani Lakshmipriya Devi took up the administration of Beltola Mouza in 1937 CE after her husband Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev died suddenly in an accident on a hunting excursion. Since their children, two sons and one daughter were in their minor age, the queen undertook to look after the administration of Beltola Mouza. Due to her efficiency in handling the administration, Rani Lakshmipriya Devi became very popular among the people of Beltola. She actively participated in the welfare programs of the people and performs charity in various religious ceremonies.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 19-20</ref> She took utmost care for the educations of her children. Her elder son '''Kumar Jatindra Narayan Dev''', after completion of his college education, was sent to Colorado School of Mines in [[United States of America]].  Her second son, '''Dwijendra Narayan Dev''' was also a prominent film producer and director.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 34</ref> After India\u2019s independence in 1947, the power of administration of Beltola Mouza was transferred to the Government of [[Assam]]. In 1956 CE, the Government of India abolished the Zamindari or the system of landlords. Due to which the royal family of Beltola lost much of their lands, which were distributed to the landless peasants.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 53</ref> In 1974 CE, the Government of India abolished all the special privileges bestowed to former royal families of India. The royal family of Beltola was also affected by these changes and the rank of Beltola Mouza was demoted from Raj Mouza to that of general category Mouza.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 54</ref> [[File:Beltola Market, Beltola, Guwahati.jpg|thumb|Women from various indigenous ethnic communities engaged in business in Historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar]] In spite of the loss of power and privileges, Rani Lakshmipriya Devi continued her social welfare programs for the common people. She also raised her voice for the indigenous Assamese communities of Beltola Mouza, when the population of the local indigenous communities faced the threat for their existence due to the settlement of large number of people from different parts of [[Assam]] in Beltola, as the city of Guwahati expands into Beltola Mouza. She also worked to protect the rights of indigenous communities in the historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar, when some outside business community tried to expel them. It was partly because of her effort that the historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar still retains the indigenous character of being a meeting point for the people from hills and plains.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 24</ref> Rani Lakshmipriya died in 1991, at the age of 80 years.<ref>Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 15</ref> Her daughter '''Madhuri Choudhury''' wrote several books on her life and several others on the history of [[Beltola]]. The royal family of Beltola still holds the official post of Mouzadar of Beltola Mouza though they do not have any power of administration except collecting land taxes for Government of [[Assam]].\n\n==Beltola after India\u2019s independence==\nAfter India\u2019s independence from British rule, [[Guwahati]] became the prominent city of Assam, but the Beltola Mouza was still not a part of Guwahati city. Beltola and Guwahati were separate places at that time. In 1973 CE, Sarat Chandra Singha, the then Chief Minister of [[Assam]], decided to shift the capital of [[Assam]] from [[Shillong]]. A small village named [[Dispur]] in Beltola Mouza was selected temporarily as the Capital of Assam. After this decision, all the important government offices were shifted to Dispur. People from different parts of Assam came and settled in and around Dispur, quickly converting a rural area, into a thickly populated region. As the year progressed, the city of Guwahati expanded, and Dispur and Beltola became a part of Greater Guwahati city. Dispur became a permanent seat of the Government of Assam and remained as the Capital. Today Beltola and Guwahati are no longer considered as separate places, but rather part of the same city.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bhuyan Dr. S.K.
