It was popular with [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War]], and is still sung frequently in the South to this day.  It has been recorded and sung by scores of artists, including [[Burl Ives]], [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and [[The Kingston Trio]].\n\nThe lyrics of \"Goober Peas\" are a description of daily life during the last few years of the Civil War for Southerners. After being cut off from the rail lines and their farm land, they had little to eat aside from [[boiled peanuts]] (or \"goober peas\") which often served as an emergency ration. Peanuts were also known as pindars and goobers.   As peanuts (or ground nuts) are a common food in West and Central Africa, imported Africans provided these names to the U.S.'s vocabulary.\n\nPublication date on the earliest sheet music is 1866, published by [[Armand Blackmar|A. E. Blackmar]] in New Orleans. Blackmar humorously lists A. Pindar as the lyricist and [[peanut|P. Nutt]] as the composer.<ref>Pindar, \"Goober Peas\".</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n''Verse 1''\n:Sitting by the roadside on a summer's day\n:Chatting with my [[mess]]-mates, passing time away\n:Lying in the shadows underneath the trees\n:Goodness, how delicious, eating goober peas.\n\n:''Chorus''\n::Peas, peas, peas, peas\n::Eating goober peas\n::Goodness, how delicious,\n::Eating goober peas.\n\n''Verse 2''\n:When a horse-man passes, the soldiers have a rule\n:To cry out their loudest, \"[[Mister, here's your mule]]!\"\n:But another custom, enchanting-er than these\n:Is wearing out your grinders, eating goober peas.\n:Chorus\n\n''Verse 3''\n:Just before the battle, the General hears a row\n:He says \"The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now.\"\n:He turns around in wonder, and what d'ya think he sees?\n:The 15th Alabama, eating goober peas. \n:Chorus\n::(Note: ''There sat the 15th Alambama,'' is reported in contemporary accounts\n\n''Verse 4''\n:I think my song has lasted almost long enough.\n:The subject's interesting, but the rhymes are mighty tough.\n:I wish the war was over, so free from rags and fleas\n:We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, and gobble goober peas.\n:Chorus\n{{listen|filename=Goober Peas.ogg|title=Goober Peas|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n==Additional verse==\nThe Reverend Wayland Fuller Dunaway recorded a stanza of the song he heard while imprisoned at the Union prison on [[Johnson's Island]], Ohio, during the latter part of the Civil War.

It was popular with [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War]], and is still sung frequently in the South to this day.  It has been recorded and sung by scores of artists, including [[Burl Ives]], [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and [[The Kingston Trio]].\n\nThe lyrics of \"Goober Peas\" are a description of daily life during the last few years of the Civil War for Southerners. After being cut off from the rail lines and their farm land, they had little to eat aside from [[boiled peanuts]] (or \"goober peas\") which often served as an emergency ration. Peanuts were also known as pindars and goobers.\n\nPublication date on the earliest sheet music is 1866, published by [[Armand Blackmar|A. E. Blackmar]] in New Orleans. Blackmar humorously lists A. Pindar as the lyricist and [[peanut|P. Nutt]] as the composer.<ref>Pindar, \"Goober Peas\".</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n''Verse 1''\n:Sitting by the roadside on a summer's day\n:Chatting with my [[mess]]-mates, passing time away\n:Lying in the shadows underneath the trees\n:Goodness, how delicious, eating goober peas.\n\n:''Chorus''\n::Peas, peas, peas, peas\n::Eating goober peas\n::Goodness, how delicious,\n::Eating goober peas.\n\n''Verse 2''\n:When a horse-man passes, the soldiers have a rule\n:To cry out their loudest, \"[[Mister, here's your mule]]!\"\n:But another custom, enchanting-er than these\n:Is wearing out your grinders, eating goober peas.\n:Chorus\n\n''Verse 3''\n:Just before the battle, the General hears a row\n:He says \"The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now.\"\n:He turns around in wonder, and what d'ya think he sees?\n:The 15th Alabama, eating goober peas. \n:Chorus\n::(Note: ''There sat the 15th Alambama,'' is reported in contemporary accounts\n\n''Verse 4''\n:I think my song has lasted almost long enough.\n:The subject's interesting, but the rhymes are mighty tough.\n:I wish the war was over, so free from rags and fleas\n:We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, and gobble goober peas.\n:Chorus\n{{listen|filename=Goober Peas.ogg|title=Goober Peas|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n==Additional verse==\nThe Reverend Wayland Fuller Dunaway recorded a stanza of the song he heard while imprisoned at the Union prison on [[Johnson's Island]], Ohio, during the latter part of the Civil War.

His father was Seafield Laurence Stewart Murray Head (1919\u20132009), a documentary filmmaker and a founder of [[Verity Films]], and his mother was actress [[Helen Shingler]] (1919\u20132019). They had married in 1944 in [[Watford]]. His older brother is actor and singer [[Murray Head]]. Both brothers have played the part of Freddie Trumper in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]], London, with Murray a part of the original cast in 1986, whilst Anthony was in the final cast in 1989.\n\n==Career==\nHead was educated at Sunbury Grammar School and [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA).<ref name=\"headfaq\" /> In discussing why he chose acting as a career, in an interview in 2013 he said that 'When it's in your family, it's a choice, it's there. It's not a jump to say: 'I want to act.' When I was six I was in a little show my mother's friends organised, playing the Emperor in The Emperor's New Clothes. I remember thinking: 'This is the business, this is what I want to do.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/30/anthony-head-why-im-happy-eve-myles-is-my-girlfriend-4166026/|publisher=Metro newspaper|accessdate=30 October 2013|date=30 October 2013|title=Anthony Head: Why I'm happy Eve Myles is my 'girlfriend'}}</ref>\n\nHis first role was in the musical ''[[Godspell]]''; this led to roles in television on both [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], one of his earliest being an appearance in the series ''[[Enemy at the Door]]'' (ITV, 1978\u20131980).

(A version made for North America featured the American brand name [[Taster's Choice]].) The soap opera nature of the commercials brought him wider recognition, along with a part in the [[CITV|Children's ITV]] comedy drama ''[[Woof!]]''\n\nHead played Frank N. Furter in the 1990\u201391 West End revival of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' at London's [[Piccadilly Theatre]], with [[Craig Ferguson]] as Brad Majors. In 1991 Head's rendition of \"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\" was released as a single by [[Chrysalis Records]]. Head played the role again in the summer of 1995 at London's [[Duke of York's Theatre]], a 3 May 2006 tribute show at London's [[Royal Court Theatre]], and a 14 October 2000 production at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"Rocky\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockymusic.org/tags/Anthony+Stewart+Head.php |title=Anthony Stewart Head |work=RockyMusic |date=1997\u20132011 |first=Shawn |last=McHorse}}</ref>\n\nSuccess on the stage and a number of brief appearances on American television, such as in the short-lived ''[[VR.5]]'', led to accepting the role of [[Rupert Giles]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' in 1997. For this role he lived full-time in the United States during the late 1990s and early 2000s, although his family continued to live in the UK. Head left the regular cast of ''Buffy'' during the show's sixth season and subsequently appeared several times as a guest star through the conclusion of the series. In many interviews at the time, Head said he left the show to spend more time with his family, having realised that he had spent most of the year outside Britain, which added up to more than half his youngest daughter's life.\n\n===Early to mid-2000s===\nIn 2002, he co-starred in the [[BBC Two]] television series ''[[Manchild (TV series)|Manchild]]'', a show revolving around four friends approaching their fifties who try to recapture their fading youth and vitality while dealing with life as 'mature' men.

He rose to fame in the UK following his role in the [[Gold Blend couple]] television advertisements for [[Nescaf\u00e9]] Gold Blend, and is known for his roles as [[Rupert Giles]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Uther Pendragon]] in ''[[Merlin (2008 TV series)|Merlin]]'', and the Prime Minister in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nHead was born in [[Camden Town]], London. His father was Seafield Laurence Stewart Murray Head (1919\u20132009), a documentary filmmaker and a founder of [[Verity Films]], and his mother was actress [[Helen Shingler]] (1919\u20132019). They had married in 1944 in [[Watford]]. His older brother is actor and singer [[Murray Head]]. Both brothers have played the part of Freddie Trumper in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]], London, with Murray a part of the original cast in 1986, whilst Anthony was in the final cast in 1989.\n\n==Career==\nHead was educated at Sunbury Grammar School and [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA).<ref name=\"headfaq\" /> In discussing why he chose acting as a career, in an interview in 2013 he said that 'When it's in your family, it's a choice, it's there. It's not a jump to say: 'I want to act.' When I was six I was in a little show my mother's friends organised, playing the Emperor in The Emperor's New Clothes. I remember thinking: 'This is the business, this is what I want to do.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/30/anthony-head-why-im-happy-eve-myles-is-my-girlfriend-4166026/|publisher=Metro newspaper|accessdate=30 October 2013|date=30 October 2013|title=Anthony Head: Why I'm happy Eve Myles is my 'girlfriend'}}</ref>\n\nHis first role was in the musical ''[[Godspell]]''; this led to roles in television on both [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], one of his earliest being an appearance in the series ''[[Enemy at the Door]]'' (ITV, 1978\u20131980). In the early 1980s he provided backing vocals for the band [[Red Box (band)|Red Box]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewisslade.com/redbox/redboxginnyclee.html|title=LewisSlade.com|website=lewisslade.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027054248/http://www.lewisslade.com/redbox/redboxginnyclee.html|archivedate=27 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the late 1980s, he appeared in a [[Gold Blend couple|storyline series of twelve coffee commercials]] with [[Sharon Maughan]] for [[Nescaf\u00e9]] Gold Blend. (A version made for North America featured the American brand name [[Taster's Choice]].) The soap opera nature of the commercials brought him wider recognition, along with a part in the [[CITV|Children's ITV]] comedy drama ''[[Woof!]]''\n\nHead played Frank N. Furter in the 1990\u201391 West End revival of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' at London's [[Piccadilly Theatre]], with [[Craig Ferguson]] as Brad Majors. In 1991 Head's rendition of \"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\" was released as a single by [[Chrysalis Records]]. Head played the role again in the summer of 1995 at London's [[Duke of York's Theatre]], a 3 May 2006 tribute show at London's [[Royal Court Theatre]], and a 14 October 2000 production at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"Rocky\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockymusic.org/tags/Anthony+Stewart+Head.php |title=Anthony Stewart Head |work=RockyMusic |date=1997\u20132011 |first=Shawn |last=McHorse}}</ref>\n\nSuccess on the stage and a number of brief appearances on American television, such as in the short-lived ''[[VR.5]]'', led to accepting the role of [[Rupert Giles]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' in 1997. For this role he lived full-time in the United States during the late 1990s and early 2000s, although his family continued to live in the UK. Head left the regular cast of ''Buffy'' during the show's sixth season and subsequently appeared several times as a guest star through the conclusion of the series. In many interviews at the time, Head said he left the show to spend more time with his family, having realised that he had spent most of the year outside Britain, which added up to more than half his youngest daughter's life.\n\n===Early to mid-2000s===\nIn 2002, he co-starred in the [[BBC Two]] television series ''[[Manchild (TV series)|Manchild]]'', a show revolving around four friends approaching their fifties who try to recapture their fading youth and vitality while dealing with life as 'mature' men. He also appeared in guest roles in various other dramas, such as ''[[Silent Witness]]'', ''[[M.I.T.: Murder Investigation Team|Murder Investigation Team]]'', and ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]''. He appeared in the 4th series of the British hit sitcom ''[[My Family]]'' in 2003 playing one of the main characters' (Abi's) father in the episode \"May the Best Man Win\". He was featured as the Prime Minister in the popular BBC comedy sketch show ''[[Little Britain]]'' from 2003 to 2005, and guest starred in several episodes of the 2004 series of popular drama ''[[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]''.\n\nOutside television work, he has released an album of songs with musician [[George Sarah]] entitled ''[[Music for Elevators]]''. Early in his career he provided vocals for some of the tracks on the [[Chris de Burgh]] album ''The Getaway'' and the reading from ''[[The Tempest]]'' on \"Don't Pay the Ferryman\".\n\nIn 2001, he appeared in a special [[webcast]] version of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', a story called ''[[Death Comes to Time]]'', in which he played the [[Time Lord]] Valentine. He also guest starred in the ''[[Excelis Rising|Excelis Trilogy]]'', a series of ''Doctor Who'' [[radio drama|audio adventures]] produced by [[Big Finish Productions]], and in 2005 narrated the two-part documentary ''Project: WHO?'', detailing the television revival of the series, for [[BBC Radio 2]] (and released to CD in 2006 by [[BBC Audio]]). In April 2006 he appeared as a school's alien headmaster, Mr. Finch, in an episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] entitled \"[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]\". Soon after, he recorded an abridged audio book of the ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[The Nightmare of Black Island]]'' by [[Mike Tucker]]. He narrated the third and fourth series of ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]''. He also voiced the character [[List of Doctor Who villains#Baltazar|Baltazar, Scourge of the Universe]] (an evil space pirate searching for the Infinite), in the first ever animated ''Doctor Who'' special, \"[[The Infinite Quest]]\". Head had previously auditioned for the role of the [[Eighth Doctor]] for the 1996 television film, but lost out to [[Paul McGann]].\n\nIn early 2006, he appeared in an episode of ''[[Hotel Babylon]]'', a BBC One drama set in a hotel, in which he played a suicidal man who recovers and lands a music deal. The same year he filmed a pilot for a new show entitled ''Him and Us'', loosely based on the life of openly gay rock star [[Elton John]], for American TV channel [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], co-starring [[Kim Cattrall]]. In July he appeared as [[Captain Hook]] at the ''[[Children's Party at the Palace]]'', a live [[pantomime]] staged in the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]] as part of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s 80th birthday celebrations. In October 2006, he voiced Ponsonby, leader of MI6, in ''[[Destroy All Humans! 2]]''.\n\n===2000s===\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con|Comic-Con International]] in 2007, [[Joss Whedon]] said talks were almost completed for a 90-minute ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' spin-off, ''Ripper'', as a [[BBC]] special,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/07/28/comic-con-joss-whedon-panel-report/|title=Television News, Reviews and TV Show Recaps \u2013 HuffPost TV|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref> with both Head and the BBC on board.\n\n[[File:Paris Hilton at 2007 Scream Awards.jpg|thumb|right|Head with [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Bill Moseley]] at the 2007 Scream Awards.]]\nIn 2007, he portrayed [[Stockard Channing]]'s gay brother in the English film [[Sparkle (2007 film)|''Sparkle'']] and appeared as Mr Colubrine in the [[ITV1]] comedy drama ''[[Sold (TV series)|Sold]]''.

Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, [[Dubai Creek]], which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains.

Desert hyacinths grow in the ''sabkha'' plains east of the city, while acacia and [[prosopis cineraria|ghaf]] trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and [[neem]] as well as imported trees such as the [[eucalypts]] grow in Dubai's natural parks. The [[houbara bustard]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[fennec fox|desert fox]], falcon and [[Arabian oryx]] are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn.

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0049530058|location=London|pages=204|oclc=152680}}</ref>\n\n===Oil era===\n[[File:Dubai Water Canal Business Bay.jpg|thumb|View of [[Business Bay]]]]\nAfter years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring [[Abu Dhabi]], oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners.

Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nCritically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep water free port constructed by British company [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]]. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nPort Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===\n[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]] and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]\nDubai and the other '[[Trucial States]]' had long been a British [[protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'.

He is best known today for being the official who presided over the [[Pilate's court|trial]] of [[Jesus]] and ordered his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles]] and [[Nicene Creed]]s. Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Churches]] believe that Pilate became a Christian and venerate him as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Gr\u00fcll|2y=2010|2p=167}}\n\nAlthough Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. He appears to have belonged to the well-attested [[Pontia gens|Pontii]] family, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Schwartz|1y=1992|1p=398|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=121}} A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called [[Pilate stone]], as have coins that he minted. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian [[Gospels]] record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] also appear to have recorded this information. According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] movement at [[Mount Gerizim]]. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] and Christian apologist [[Origen]], most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal.{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=92\u201393}} Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. According to one prominent [[post-war]] theory, Pilate was motivated by [[antisemitism]] in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=22|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|3p=4}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Pilate became the focus of a large group of [[New Testament apocrypha]] expanding on his role in the Gospels. In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. In some, he became a Christian [[martyr]]. In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval [[legend]]s, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around [[Western Europe]].\n\nPilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [[Medieval art]] frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. In the art of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. He plays an important role in medieval [[passion plays]], where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include [[Anatole France]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the [[Second World War]]. Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film.\n\n==Life==\n===Sources===\nSources on Pontius Pilate are limited, although modern scholars know more about him than about other [[Roman administration of Judaea (AD 6\u2013135)|Roman governors of Judaea]].{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} The most important sources are the ''Embassy to Gaius'' (after 41 CE) by contemporary Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]],{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=34|ps=. \"Nach dem Tod des Caligula, unter Claudius, schrieb Philo seine 'Legatio'.\"}} the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 74 CE) and ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (c. 94 CE) by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], as well as the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (composed between 66 and 70 CE), [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), and [[Gospel of John|John]] (composed between 90 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} [[Ignatius of Antioch]] mentions him in his epistles to the [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Smyrnaeans]]{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=79}} (composed between 105 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Trebilco|2007|p=631}} He is also briefly mentioned in ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (early 2nd c.

The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Josephus states that Pilate governed for 10 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37 CE, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=8}} As Tiberius had retired to the island of [[Capri]] in 26 CE, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]], who was executed for treason in 31 CE.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=8\u20139}} Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfnm|1a1=McGing|1y=1991|1p=427|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2p=4|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=398}} [[Daniel R. Schwartz]] and Kenneth L\u00f6nnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate's governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19 CE, while L\u00f6nnqvist argues for 17/18 CE.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|L\u00f6nnqvist|2000|p=67}} This redating has not been widely accepted by other scholars.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=122}}\n\nPilate's title of prefect{{efn|Pilate's title as governor, as attested on the Pilate stone, is \"[[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of Judaea\" ({{Lang|la|praefectus Iudaeae|italics=yes}}). His title is given as {{Lang|la|[[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]]|italics=yes}} in Tacitus, and with the Greek equivalent {{Transl|grc|epitropos|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}) in Josephus and Philo.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}} The title prefect was later changed to \"procurator\" under the emperor [[Claudius]], explaining why later sources give Pilate this title.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=11\u201312}} The [[New Testament]] uses the generic Greek term {{Transl|grc|[[Hegemony|hegemon]]|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd|italics=no}}), a term also applied to Pilate in Josephus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}}}} implies that his duties were primarily military;{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=11}} however, Pilate's troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate's duties extended beyond military matters.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict [[capital punishment]], and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=70}}\n\nPilate was subordinate to the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria lacked a legate, something which [[Helen Bond]] believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=5, 14\u201315}} He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in [[Caesarea]], going to [[Jerusalem]] mainly for major feasts in order to maintain order.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=7\u20138}} He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=46}}\n\nAs governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] and also officially controlled the vestiments of the High Priest in the [[Antonia Fortress]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=86\u201388}} Unlike his predecessor, [[Valerius Gratus]], Pilate retained the same high priest, [[Caiaphas]], for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate's own removal from the governorship.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=19}} This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the [[Sadducees|Sadducee sect]] were reliable allies to Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=48}} Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the [[temple treasury]] to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=364}} Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}} Jean-Pierre L\u00e9monon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the [[Pharisees]] are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest and trial.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=172}}\n\nDaniel Schwartz takes the note in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[Luke 23]]:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king [[Herod Antipas]] as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} Based on [[John 19]]:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title \"friend of Caesar\" ({{Lang-la|amicus Caesaris|italics=yes}}, {{Lang-grc|\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 K\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}), a title also held by the Jewish kings [[Herod Agrippa I]] and [[Herod Agrippa II]] and by close advisors to the emperor.

In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event,{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate's rule.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=78}} Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the [[imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]], which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Schwartz suggests that Pilate's entire tenure was characterized by \"continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}}\n\nAccording to Josephus in his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (2.9.2) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate's house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an [[arena]], where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=52\u201353}} Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=57}} She dates this incident to early in Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=79}} Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with \"the incident with the shields\" reported in Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'', an identification first made by the early church historian [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} L\u00e9monon, however, argues against this identification.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=206}}\n\nAccording to Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'' (''Embassy to Gaius'' 38), Pilate offended against [[Halakha|Jewish law]] by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]]. The sons of [[Herod the Great]] petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod's sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared that would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields.{{sfn|Yonge|1855|pp=165\u2013166}} Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and [[Warren Carter]] argue that Philo's portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=36\u201337|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2pp=15\u201316|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=399}} It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as {{lang|la|divi Augusti filius|italics=yes}} (son of divine Augustus).{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=39}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=51\u201352}} Bond dates the incident to 31 CE, sometime after Sejanus's death in October 17.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn another incident recorded in both the ''Jewish Wars'' (2.9.4) and the ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the [[temple treasury]] ({{lang|grc|korbanos|italics=yes}}) to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=53}} The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33 CE, based on Josephus's chronology.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}}\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans \"whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices\" ([[Luke 13]]:1). This reference has been variously interpreted as referring to one of the incidents recorded by Josephus, or to an entirely unknown incident.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=194\u2013195}} Bond argues that the number of Galileans killed does not seem to have been particularly high. In Bond's view, the reference to \"sacrifices\" likely means that this incident occurred at [[Passover]] at some unknown date.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=195\u2013196}} She argues that \"[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate's governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing. The insurrection in which [[Barabbas]] was caught up, if historical, may well be another example.\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=196}}\n\n===Trial and execution of Jesus===\n{{see also|Pilate's Court|Crucifixion of Jesus}}\n{{Gospel Jesus}}\nAt the [[Passover]] of most likely 30 or 33 CE, Pontius Pilate condemned [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to death by [[crucifixion]] in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}} The main sources on the crucifixion are the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, the accounts of which vary.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=22\u201323}} Helen Bond argues that\n<blockquote>the evangelists' portrayals of Pilate have been shaped to a great extent by their own particular theological and apologetic concerns. [...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=196\u2013167}}</blockquote>\nPilate's role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], who, when explaining [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians, explains: \"Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious [[superstition]] was checked for a moment...\" (Tacitus, ''Annals'' 15.44).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}}{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} The authenticity of this passage has been disputed, and it is possible that Tacitus received this information from Christian informants.{{sfn|Ash|2018|p=194}} Josephus appears also [[Josephus on Jesus|to have mentioned Jesus]]'s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.3). However, the original text has been greatly altered by later [[Christian interpolation]], so that it is impossible to know what Josephus may have originally said.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67, 71}} Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nBond argues that Jesus's arrest was made with Pilate's prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18.3.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=197}} Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=70-71}} It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of the Jews]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=197\u2013198|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=172|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3p=74}} Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the ''[[Roman litigation#Cognitio|cognitio]]'' {{lang|la|extra ordinem|italics=yes}}, a form of trial for [[capital punishment]] used in the Roman provinces and applied to [[Roman citizenship|non-Roman citizens]] that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=198}}{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the [[Passover]] festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single [[amnesty]] in the year of Jesus's crucifixion.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=199|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2pp=173\u2013176|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3pp=75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]], 1881]]\nThe Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is \"widely assumed\" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo,{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\"{{sfn|Meier|1990|p=95}} Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacilating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel.{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=417\u2013418}} Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.{{sfn|Winter|1974|pp=85\u201386}} [[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the earliest Gospel, Mark, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 18:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-21}} Others have tried to explain Pilate's behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate's caution and the death of Sejanus.{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate's behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}}{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=435\u2013436}} Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===Removal and later life===\nAccording to Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.4.1-2), Pilate's removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed [[Samaritans]] at a village called Tirathana near [[Mount Gerizim]], where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by [[Moses]]. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheos]], a [[messiah]]-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=63}} The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the [[List of Roman governors of Syria|governor of Syria]] (term 35-39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius however, had died before his arrival.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67}} This dates the end of Pilate's governorship to 36/37 CE. Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March AD&nbsp;37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]).<ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref>\n\nFollowing Tiberius's death, Pilate's hearing would have been handled by the new emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns.{{sfn|Maier|1971|pp=366\u2013367}} The only sure outcome of Pilate's return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=367}} J. P. L\u00e9monon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=577}}\n\n[[File:A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself.

The second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist [[Origen]], writing c. 248 CE, argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus' death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=154\u2013155}} Pilate's supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, or Tacitus.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}} Maier argues that \"[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=371}} Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the ''Embassy to Gaius'', although he is writing only a few years after Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=578}}\n\n==Archaeology and minted coins==\n[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Pilate Stone]].

Perhaps the earliest apocryphal texts attributed to Pilate are denunciations of Christianity and of Jesus that claim to be Pilate's report on the crucifixion. According to [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 9.2.5), these texts were distributed during the persecution of Christians conducted by the emperor [[Maximinus II]] (reigned 308\u2013313 CE). None of these texts survive, but Tibor Gr\u00fcll argues that their contents can be reconstructed from Christian apologetic texts.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nPositive traditions about Pilate are frequent in Eastern Christianity, particularly in Egypt and Ethiopia, whereas negative traditions predominate in Western and Byzantine Christianity.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|pp=170\u2013171}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=102}} Additionally, earlier Christian traditions portray Pilate more positively than later ones,{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=37}} a change which Ann Wroe suggests reflects the fact that, following the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire by the [[Edict of Milan]] (312 CE), it was no longer necessary to deflect criticism of Pilate (and by extension of the Roman Empire) for his role in Jesus's crucifixion onto the Jews.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=329}} [[Bart Ehrman]], on the other hand, argues that the tendency in the Early Church to exonerate Pilate and blame the Jews prior to this time reflects an increasing \"anti-Judaism\" among Early Christians.{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-22}} The earliest attestation of a positive tradition about Pilate comes from the late first-, early second-century Christian author [[Tertullian]], who, claiming to have seen Pilate's report to Tiberius, states Pilate had \"become already a Christian in his conscience.\"{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=166}} An earlier reference to Pilate's records of Jesus's trial is given by Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] around 160 CE.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=94}} Tibor Gr\u00fcll believes that this could be a reference to Pilate's actual records,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=166}} but other scholars argue that Justin has simply invented the records as a source on the assumption that they existed without ever having verified their existence.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|p=22}}\n\n===New Testament Apocrypha===\nBeginning in the fourth century, a large body of Christian apocryphal texts developed concerning Pilate, making up one of the largest groups of surviving [[New Testament Apocrypha]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=25}} Originally, these texts served both to unburden Pilate of guilt for the death of Jesus as well as to provide more complete records of Jesus's trial.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=93\u201394}} The apocryphal [[Gospel of Peter]] completely exonerates Pilate for the crucifixion, which is instead performed by Herod.{{sfn|Koester|1980|p=126}} Moreover, the text makes explicit that while Pilate washes his hands of guilt, neither the Jews nor Herod do so.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=26}} The Gospel includes a scene in which the centurions who had been guarding Jesus' tomb report to Pilate that Jesus has been resurrected.{{sfn|Koester|1980|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThe fragmentary third-century [[Manichaean]] ''[[Gospel of Mani]]'' has Pilate refer to Jesus as \"the Son of God\" and telling his centurions to \"[k]eep this secret\".{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=27}}\n\nIn the most common version of the passion narrative in the apocryphal [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] (also called the ''Acts of Pilate''), Pilate is portrayed as forced to execute Jesus by the Jews and as distraught at having done so.{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|p=4}} One version claims to have been discovered and translated by a Jewish convert named Ananias, portraying itself as the official Jewish records of the crucifixion.{{sfn|Dilley|2010|pp=592\u2013594}} Another claims that the records were made by Pilate himself, relying on reports made to him by Nicodemus and [[Joseph of Arimathea]].{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|p=6}} Some Eastern versions of the Gospel of Nicodemus claim that Pilate was born in Egypt, which likely aided his popularity there.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=168}} The Christian Pilate literature surrounding the Gospel of Nicodemus includes at least fifteen late antique and early medieval texts, called the \"Pilate cycle\", written and preserved in various languages and versions and dealing largely with Pontius Pilate.{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|pp=9\u201311, 419\u2013519}} Two of these include purported reports made by Pilate to the emperor (either unnamed or named as Tiberius or [[Claudius]]) on the crucifixion, in which Pilate recounts Jesus' death and resurrection, blaming the Jews.{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|p=7}} Another purports to be an angry reply by Tiberius, condemning Pilate for his role in Jesus' death.{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|p=7}} Another early text is an apocryphal letter attributed to \"Herod\" (a composite character of the various Herods in the Bible), which claims to respond to a letter from Pilate in which Pilate spoke of his remorse for Jesus' crucifixion and of having had a vision of the risen Christ; \"Herod\" asks Pilate to pray for him.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn the so-called ''Book of the Cock'', a late-antique apocryphal passion Gospel only preserved in [[Ge'ez]] (Ethiopic) but translated from Arabic,{{sfn|Piovanelli|2003|pp=427-428}} Pilate attempts to avoid Jesus's execution by sending him to Herod and writing further letters arguing with Herod not to execute Jesus. Pilate's family become Christians after Jesus miraculously cures Pilate's daughters of their deaf-muteness. Pilate is nevertheless forced to execute Jesus by the increasingly angry crowd, but Jesus tells Pilate that he does not hold him responsible.{{sfn|Piovanelli|2003|p=430}} This book enjoys \"a quasi-canonical status\" among Ethiopian Christians to this day and continues to be read beside the canonical gospels during [[Holy Week]].{{sfn|Piovanelli|2003|pp=433-434}}\n\n====Pilate's death in the apocrypha====\nSeven of the Pilate texts mention Pilate's fate after the crucifixion: in three, he becomes a very positive figure, while in four he is presented as diabolically evil.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|pp=159\u2013160}} A fifth-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the ''Acts of Pilate'' explains Pilate's conversion as occurring after he has blamed the Jews for Jesus' death in front of Tiberius; prior to his execution, Pilate prays to God and converts, thereby becoming a Christian martyr.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|pp=166\u2013167}} In the Greek ''Paradosis Pilati'' (5th c.),{{sfn|Izydorczyk|1997|p=7}} Pilate is arrested and martyred as a follower of Christ.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}} His beheading is accompanied by a voice from heaven calling him blessed and saying he will be with Jesus at [[the Second Coming]].{{sfn|Burke|2018|p=266}} The ''Evangelium Gamalielis'', possibly of medieval origin and preserved in Arabic, Coptic, and [[Ge'ez]],{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=160}} says Jesus was crucified by Herod, whereas Pilate was a true believer in Christ who was martyred for his faith; similarly, the ''Martyrium Pilati'', possibly medieval and preserved in Arabic, Coptic, and Ge'ez,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=160}} portrays Pilate, as well as his wife and two children, as being crucified twice, once by the Jews and once by Tiberius, for his faith.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}\n\nIn addition to the report on Pilate's suicide in Eusebius, Gr\u00fcll notes three Western apocryphal traditions about Pilate's suicide. In the ''[[Cura sanitatis Tiberii]]'' (dated variously 5th to 7th c.),{{sfn|Gounelle|2011|p=233}} the emperor Tiberius is healed by an image of Jesus brought by [[Saint Veronica]], [[Saint Peter]] then confirms Pilate's report on Jesus's miracles, and Pilate is exiled by the emperor [[Nero]], after which he commits suicide.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=162}} A similar narrative plays out in the ''[[Vindicta Salvatoris]]'' (8th c.).{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=162}}{{sfn|Gounelle|2011|pp=243-244}} In the ''Mors Pilati'' (perhaps originally 6th c., but recorded c. 1300),{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=36}} Pilate was forced to commit suicide and his body thrown in the Tiber. However, the body is surrounded by demons and storms, so that it is removed from the Tiber and instead cast into the Rhone, where the same thing happens. Finally, the corpse is taken to [[Lausanne]] in modern Switzerland and buried in an isolated pit, where demonic visitations continue to occur.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\n===Later legends===\n[[File:Pontius Pilatus angebl Grabmal Vienne (IZ 48-1867 S 266 JResch).jpg|thumb|19th-c. lithograph of the supposed tomb of Pontius Pilate in [[Vienne]], France.

The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller's daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate's name thus results from the combination of the names ''Pila'' with ''Atus''. A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father's court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod's power.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=101\u2013102}} The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ's healing powers, sends for him only to learn from [[Saint Veronica]] that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus's coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nOne important version of the Pilate legend is found in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] (1263\u20131273), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages.{{sfn|Martin|1973|p=109}} In the ''Golden Legend'', Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with [[Judas]], first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas's father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben's property after Judas has killed his own father.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=234}}\n\nSeveral places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of [[Lyon]] and [[Vienne]] in modern France claim to be Pilate's birthplace: Vienne has a ''Maison de Pilate'', a ''Pr\u00e9toire de Pilate'' and a ''Tour de Pilate''.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} One tradition states the Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called [[Mount Pilatus]]) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 onwards, while [[Lake Lucerne]] has been called \"Pilatus-See\" (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=104\u2013105}} A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany.

The Byzantine chronicler [[George Kedrenos]] (c. 1100) wrote that Pilate was condemned by Caligula to die by being left in the sun closed inside the skin of a freshly slaughtered cow together with a chicken, a snake, and a monkey.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=102\u2013103}} In a legend from medieval [[Rus' (region)|Rus']], Pilate attempts in vain to save [[Saint Stephen]] from being executed; Pilate, his wife and children have themselves baptized and bury Stephen in a gilded silver coffin.

He is frequently depicted as a more important character to the narrative than even Jesus,{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=363}} and became one of the most important figures of medieval drama in the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=296}} The three most popular scenes in the plays to include Pilate are his washing of hands, the warning of his wife Procula not to harm Jesus, and the writing of the ''titulus'' on Jesus' cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} Pilate's characterization varies greatly from play to play, but later plays frequently portray Pilate somewhat ambiguously, though he is usually a negative character, and sometimes an evil villain.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=363\u2013364}} While in some plays Pilate is opposed to the Jews and condemns them, in others he describes himself as a Jew or supports their wish to kill Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}}\n\nIn the passion plays from the continental Western Europe, Pilate's characterization varies from good to evil, but he is mostly a benign figure.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}} The earliest surviving passion play, the thirteenth-century {{lang|la|Ludus de Passione|italics=yes}} from [[Klosterneuburg]], portrays Pilate as a weak administrator who succumbs to the whims of the Jews in having Christ crucified.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=237}} Pilate goes on to play an important role in the increasingly long and elaborate passion plays performed in the German-speaking countries and in France.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=365\u2013366}} In [[Arnoul Gr\u00e9ban]]'s fifteenth-century ''Passion'', Pilate instructs the flagellators on how best to whip Jesus.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=283\u2013284}} The 1517 {{lang|de|Alsfelder Passionsspiel|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as condemning Christ to death out of fear of losing Herod's friendship and to earn the Jews' good will, despite his long dialogues with the Jews in which he professes Christ's innocence. He eventually becomes a Christian himself.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=366\u2013367}} In the 1493 {{lang|de|Frankfurter Passionsspiel|italics=yes}}, on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=367\u2013368}} The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod's, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=252}} Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe fifteenth-century Roman {{lang|it|Passione|italics=yes}} depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}} In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century {{lang|it|Resurrezione|italics=yes}} and stressing the Jews' fear of the \"new law\" of Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nHourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290, Pilate's characterization may have been used primarily to satyrize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=265}} In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=177\u2013178}} In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan's agent ({{lang|la|mali actoris|italics=yes}}) while plotting Christ's torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=286}} Yet many scholars believe the motif of the conniving devil and the Jews to be inextricably linked. By the thirteenth century, medieval arts and literature had a well-established tradition of the Jew as the Devil in disguise. <ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, some scholars believe that Anti-Judaism still lies near the heart of the matter.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ's torturer to give him Christ's clothes at the foot of the cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=243}} It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297, 328}} In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]], becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=243\u2013245}} In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=213\u2013214}} Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the [[Potter's field]], thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=328}} In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=352}}\n\nThe fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, {{Lang|fr|La Vengeance de Nostre-Seigneur|italics=yes}}, exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ's tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=317}} Another play focusing on Pilate's death is Cornish and based on the {{lang|la|Mors Pilati|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=318}} The {{lang|fr|Myst\u00e8re de la Passion d'Angers|italics=yes}} by [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]] includes legendary scenes of Pilate's life before the passion.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}}\n\n===Modern literature===\nPontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}} One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer [[Anatole France]]'s 1892 short story {{lang|fr|\"Le Procurateur de Jud\u00e9e\"|italics=no}} (\"The Procurator of Judaea\"), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to [[Sicily]]. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=358}} Spending his time at the baths of [[Baiae]], Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}}\n\nPilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1933 play ''[[On the Rocks: A Political Comedy|On the Rocks]]'' where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=195}} Shortly afterwards, French writer [[Roger Caillois]] wrote a novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}}\n\nPilate features prominently in Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty six years after the author's death.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Henry I. MacAdam describes it as \"the 'cult classic' of Pilate-related fiction.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}} The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for \"Pilatism\" by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of ''The Master and Margarita''. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as \"a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=273}} Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|p=165}} Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xiii}} Pilate's burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov's novel.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=371}}\n\nThe majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}} One of Swiss writer [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s earliest stories (\"Pilatus,\" 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}} Swiss playwright [[Max Frisch]]'s comedy {{lang|de|Die chinesische Mauer|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=107\u2013109}} The German Catholic novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]]'s {{lang|de|Die Frau des Pilatus|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate's wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate's guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]] published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled {{lang|ru|Placha|italics=yes}} (''The Place of the Skull''). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as an materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus's teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\n===Film===\nPilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ's passion already in some of the earliest films produced.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=278-2280}} In the 1927 silent film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor [[Victor Varconi]], who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]], which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes \"not power that he possesses but power that possesses him\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=283}} During the ''Ecce homo'' scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=284-285}}\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) portrays Pilate as \"a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire\", with the actor [[Basil Rathbone]] giving him long fingers and a long nose.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=167}} The 1953 film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} The 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' shows Pilate presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says \"seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]],\" with Pilate bored and sneering.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=186}} Martin Winkler, however, argues that ''Ben-Hur'' provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Ponzio Pilato 1962 Marais.png|thumb|Jean Marais as Pontius Pilate in {{lang|it|Ponzio Pilato|italics=yes}} (1962)]]\nOnly one film has been made entirely in Pilate's perspective, the 1962 French-Italian ''[[Ponzio Pilato]]'', where Pilate was played by [[Jean Marais]].{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} In the 1973 film [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|''Jesus Christ Superstar'']], the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and \"the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} The Pilate in the film, played by [[Barry Dennen]], expands on [[John 18:38]] to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough's view, as \"an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} Speaking of Dennen's portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a \"cornered animal.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=290}} Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminancy,{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} illustrated by the Pilate in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', where Pilate lisps and mispronounces his r's as w's. In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), Pilate is played by [[David Bowie]], who appears as \"gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} Bowie's Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus ([[Willem Dafoe]]).{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=290-291}} The trial takes place in Pilate's private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus's death, which he orders without any qualms.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=291-293}}\n\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' portrays Pilate, played by [[Hristo Shopov]], as a sympathetic, noble-minded character,{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities' treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water.{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} McDonough argues that \"Shopov gives US a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=295}}\n\n==Legacy==\nPontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Apostles Creed]]. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=15 July 2019|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302101028/http://cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Nicene Creed states \"For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"<ref>[[s:Nicene Creed (ECUSA Book of Common Prayer)|Nicene Creed in English]]</ref> These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=1}} Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] mentioned by name in the creeds.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=391}} The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=78}}\n\nHe is venerated as a saint by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] with a feast day on June 19,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=11}} and by the [[Coptic Church]], with a feast day of June 25.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=4}}\n\nPilate's washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus's death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination,{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} and is the origin of the English phrase [[Wiktionary:wash one's hands of|\"to wash one's hands of (the matter)\"]], meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something.{{sfn|Martin|2019}} Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the [[Gospel of John]] have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the [[Vulgate]].{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}} These include {{bibleverse|John|18:35|KJV}} ({{Lang|la|numquid ego Iudaeus sum?|italics=yes}} \"Am I a Jew?\"), [[John 18:38]] ({{Lang|la|Quid est veritas?|italics=yes}}; \"what is truth?\"), [[John 19#Verse 5|John 19:5]] ({{Lang|la|[[Ecce homo]]|italics=yes}}, \"Behold the man!\"), {{bibleverse|John|19:14|KJV}} ({{lang|la|Ecce rex vester|italics=yes}}, \"Behold your king!\"), and {{bibleverse|John|19:22|KJV}} ({{lang|la|[[Quod scripsi, scripsi]]|italics=yes}}, \"What I have written, I have written\").{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}}\n\nThe Gospels' deflection of responsibility for Jesus's crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting [[antisemitism]] from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=331\u2013332}}\n\n===Scholarly assessments===\nThe main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels \"comparatively friendly.\"{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=415\u2013416}} This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate's long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\nOn the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was \"a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=363}} However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate's long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator,{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=365}} while Henry MacAdam argues that \"[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=77}} Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nBeginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by [[Sejanus]], that Pilate's offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate's coins.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=9\u201310}} According to this theory, following Sejanus's execution in 31 CE and Tiberius's purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vaciliating attitude at the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=10\u201311}} Helen Bond argues that \"[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate's coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=21}} and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=22}} Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that \"[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.\"{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal| last1=Amora-Stark |first1=Shua |display-authors=etal |title= An Inscribed Copper-Alloy Finger Ring from Herodium Depicting a Krater |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume= 68 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=208\u2013220|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329307909 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Ash |editor-first=Rhiannon |title=Tacitus Annals.

He is best known today for being the official who presided over the [[Pilate's court|trial]] of [[Jesus]] and ordered his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles]] and [[Nicene Creed]]s. Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Churches]] believe that Pilate became a Christian and venerate him as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Gr\u00fcll|2y=2010|2p=167}}\n\nAlthough Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. He appears to have belonged to the well-attested [[Pontia gens|Pontii]] family, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Schwartz|1y=1992|1p=398|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=121}} A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called [[Pilate stone]], as have coins that he minted. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian [[Gospels]] record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] also appear to have recorded this information. According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] movement at [[Mount Gerizim]]. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] and Christian apologist [[Origen]], most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal.{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=92\u201393}} Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. According to one prominent [[post-war]] theory, Pilate was motivated by [[antisemitism]] in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=22|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|3p=4}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Pilate became the focus of a large group of [[New Testament apocrypha]] expanding on his role in the Gospels. In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. In some, he became a Christian [[martyr]]. In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval [[legend]]s, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around [[Western Europe]].\n\nPilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [[Medieval art]] frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. In the art of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. He plays an important role in medieval [[passion plays]], where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include [[Anatole France]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the [[Second World War]]. Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film.\n\n==Life==\n===Sources===\nSources on Pontius Pilate are limited, although modern scholars know more about him than about other [[Roman administration of Judaea (AD 6\u2013135)|Roman governors of Judaea]].{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} The most important sources are the ''Embassy to Gaius'' (after 41 CE) by contemporary Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]],{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=34|ps=. \"Nach dem Tod des Caligula, unter Claudius, schrieb Philo seine 'Legatio'.\"}} the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 74 CE) and ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (c. 94 CE) by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], as well as the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (composed between 66 and 70 CE), [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), and [[Gospel of John|John]] (composed between 90 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} [[Ignatius of Antioch]] mentions him in his epistles to the [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Smyrnaeans]]{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=79}} (composed between 105 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Trebilco|2007|p=631}} He is also briefly mentioned in ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (early 2nd c. CE), who simply says that he put Jesus to death.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} Two additional chapters of Tacitus's ''Annals'' that might have mentioned Pilate have been lost.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=xii}} Besides these texts, coins minted by Pilate have survived, as well as a fragmentary short inscription that names Pilate, known as the [[Pilate Stone]], the only inscription about a Roman governor of Judaea predating the [[Roman-Jewish Wars]] to survive.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=75}} The written sources provide only limited information and each has its own biases, with the gospels in particular providing a theological rather than historical perspective on Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\n===Early life===\nThe sources give no indication of Pilate's life prior to his becoming governor of Judaea.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} His [[praenomen]] (first name) is unknown;{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} his [[cognomen]] ''Pilatus'' might mean \"skilled with the javelin ({{Lang|la|[[pilum]]|italics=yes}}),\" but it could also refer to the {{Lang|la|[[Pileus (hat)|pileus]]|italics=yes}} or [[Phrygian cap]], possibly indicating that one of Pilate's ancestors was a [[freedman]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=47\u201348}} If it means \"skilled with the javelin,\" it is possible that Pilate won the cognomen for himself while serving in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]];{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} it is also possible that his father acquired the cognomen through military skill.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=16}} In the Gospels of Mark and John, Pilate is only called by his cognomen, which Marie-Joseph Ollivier takes to mean that this was the name by which he was generally known in common speech.{{sfn|Ollivier|1896|p=252}} The name ''Pontius'' indicates that he belonged to the [[Pontia gens|Pontii family]],{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} a well-known family of [[Samnites|Samnite]] origin which produced a number of important individuals in the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}} Like all but one other governor of Judaea, Pilate was of the [[equites|equestrian order]], a middle rank of the Roman nobility.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=9}} As one of the attested Pontii, [[Pontius Aquila]], an assassin of [[Julius Caesar]], was a [[Tribune of the Plebs]], the family must have originally been of [[Plebs|Plebeian]] origin. They became ennobled as equestrians.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nPilate was likely educated, somewhat wealthy, and well-connected politically and socially.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=15}} He was probably married, but the only extant reference to [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]], in which she tells him after a disturbing dream not to interact with Jesus ({{bibleverse|Matthew|27:19|KJV}}), is generally dismissed as legendary.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=197|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=76-77|3a1=L\u00e9monon|3y=2007|3p=167}} According to the ''[[Tres militiae|cursus honorum]]'' established by [[Augustus]] for office holders of equestrian rank, Pilate would have had a military command before becoming prefect of Judaea; [[Alexander Demandt]] speculates that this could have been with a legion stationed at the [[Rhine]] or [[Danube]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=48}} Although it is therefore likely Pilate served in the military, it is nevertheless not certain.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n===Role as governor of Judaea===\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|Map of the province of Judaea during Pilate's governorship in the first century CE.]]\nPilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, during the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Josephus states that Pilate governed for 10 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37 CE, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=8}} As Tiberius had retired to the island of [[Capri]] in 26 CE, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]], who was executed for treason in 31 CE.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=8\u20139}} Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfnm|1a1=McGing|1y=1991|1p=427|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2p=4|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=398}} [[Daniel R. Schwartz]] and Kenneth L\u00f6nnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate's governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19 CE, while L\u00f6nnqvist argues for 17/18 CE.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|L\u00f6nnqvist|2000|p=67}} This redating has not been widely accepted by other scholars.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=122}}\n\nPilate's title of prefect{{efn|Pilate's title as governor, as attested on the Pilate stone, is \"[[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of Judaea\" ({{Lang|la|praefectus Iudaeae|italics=yes}}). His title is given as {{Lang|la|[[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]]|italics=yes}} in Tacitus, and with the Greek equivalent {{Transl|grc|epitropos|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}) in Josephus and Philo.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}} The title prefect was later changed to \"procurator\" under the emperor [[Claudius]], explaining why later sources give Pilate this title.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=11\u201312}} The [[New Testament]] uses the generic Greek term {{Transl|grc|[[Hegemony|hegemon]]|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd|italics=no}}), a term also applied to Pilate in Josephus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}}}} implies that his duties were primarily military;{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=11}} however, Pilate's troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate's duties extended beyond military matters.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict [[capital punishment]], and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=70}}\n\nPilate was subordinate to the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria lacked a legate, something which [[Helen Bond]] believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=5, 14\u201315}} He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in [[Caesarea]], going to [[Jerusalem]] mainly for major feasts in order to maintain order.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=7\u20138}} He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=46}}\n\nAs governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] and also officially controlled the vestiments of the High Priest in the [[Antonia Fortress]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=86\u201388}} Unlike his predecessor, [[Valerius Gratus]], Pilate retained the same high priest, [[Caiaphas]], for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate's own removal from the governorship.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=19}} This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the [[Sadducees|Sadducee sect]] were reliable allies to Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=48}} Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the [[temple treasury]] to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=364}} Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}} Jean-Pierre L\u00e9monon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the [[Pharisees]] are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest and trial.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=172}}\n\nDaniel Schwartz takes the note in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[Luke 23]]:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king [[Herod Antipas]] as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} Based on [[John 19]]:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title \"friend of Caesar\" ({{Lang-la|amicus Caesaris|italics=yes}}, {{Lang-grc|\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 K\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}), a title also held by the Jewish kings [[Herod Agrippa I]] and [[Herod Agrippa II]] and by close advisors to the emperor. Both Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt do not think this information especially likely.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n===Incidents with the Jews===\n\nVarious disturbances during Pilate's governship are recorded in the sources. In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event,{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate's rule.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=78}} Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the [[imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]], which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Schwartz suggests that Pilate's entire tenure was characterized by \"continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}}\n\nAccording to Josephus in his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (2.9.2) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate's house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an [[arena]], where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=52\u201353}} Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=57}} She dates this incident to early in Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=79}} Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with \"the incident with the shields\" reported in Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'', an identification first made by the early church historian [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} L\u00e9monon, however, argues against this identification.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=206}}\n\nAccording to Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'' (''Embassy to Gaius'' 38), Pilate offended against [[Halakha|Jewish law]] by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]]. The sons of [[Herod the Great]] petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod's sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared that would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields.{{sfn|Yonge|1855|pp=165\u2013166}} Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and [[Warren Carter]] argue that Philo's portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=36\u201337|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2pp=15\u201316|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=399}} It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as {{lang|la|divi Augusti filius|italics=yes}} (son of divine Augustus).{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=39}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=51\u201352}} Bond dates the incident to 31 CE, sometime after Sejanus's death in October 17.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn another incident recorded in both the ''Jewish Wars'' (2.9.4) and the ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the [[temple treasury]] ({{lang|grc|korbanos|italics=yes}}) to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=53}} The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33 CE, based on Josephus's chronology.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}}\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans \"whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices\" ([[Luke 13]]:1).

In Bond's view, the reference to \"sacrifices\" likely means that this incident occurred at [[Passover]] at some unknown date.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=195\u2013196}} She argues that \"[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate's governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing.

[...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=196\u2013167}}</blockquote>\nPilate's role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], who, when explaining [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians, explains: \"Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious [[superstition]] was checked for a moment...\" (Tacitus, ''Annals'' 15.44).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}}{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} The authenticity of this passage has been disputed, and it is possible that Tacitus received this information from Christian informants.{{sfn|Ash|2018|p=194}} Josephus appears also [[Josephus on Jesus|to have mentioned Jesus]]'s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.3). However, the original text has been greatly altered by later [[Christian interpolation]], so that it is impossible to know what Josephus may have originally said.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67, 71}} Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nBond argues that Jesus's arrest was made with Pilate's prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18.3.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=197}} Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=70-71}} It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of the Jews]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=197\u2013198|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=172|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3p=74}} Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the ''[[Roman litigation#Cognitio|cognitio]]'' {{lang|la|extra ordinem|italics=yes}}, a form of trial for [[capital punishment]] used in the Roman provinces and applied to [[Roman citizenship|non-Roman citizens]] that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=198}}{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the [[Passover]] festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single [[amnesty]] in the year of Jesus's crucifixion.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=199|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2pp=173\u2013176|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3pp=75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]], 1881]]\nThe Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is \"widely assumed\" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo,{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\"{{sfn|Meier|1990|p=95}} Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacilating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel.{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=417\u2013418}} Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.{{sfn|Winter|1974|pp=85\u201386}} [[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the earliest Gospel, Mark, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 18:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-21}} Others have tried to explain Pilate's behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate's caution and the death of Sejanus.{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate's behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}}{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=435\u2013436}} Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===Removal and later life===\nAccording to Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.4.1-2), Pilate's removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed [[Samaritans]] at a village called Tirathana near [[Mount Gerizim]], where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by [[Moses]]. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheos]], a [[messiah]]-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=63}} The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the [[List of Roman governors of Syria|governor of Syria]] (term 35-39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius however, had died before his arrival.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67}} This dates the end of Pilate's governorship to 36/37 CE. Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March AD&nbsp;37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]).<ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref>\n\nFollowing Tiberius's death, Pilate's hearing would have been handled by the new emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns.{{sfn|Maier|1971|pp=366\u2013367}} The only sure outcome of Pilate's return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=367}} J. P. L\u00e9monon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=577}}\n\n[[File:A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself.

The second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist [[Origen]], writing c. 248 CE, argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus' death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=154\u2013155}} Pilate's supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, or Tacitus.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}} Maier argues that \"[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=371}} Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the ''Embassy to Gaius'', although he is writing only a few years after Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=578}}\n\n==Archaeology and minted coins==\n[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Pilate Stone]].

The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller's daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate's name thus results from the combination of the names ''Pila'' with ''Atus''. A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father's court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod's power.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=101\u2013102}} The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ's healing powers, sends for him only to learn from [[Saint Veronica]] that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus's coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nOne important version of the Pilate legend is found in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] (1263\u20131273), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages.{{sfn|Martin|1973|p=109}} In the ''Golden Legend'', Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with [[Judas]], first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas's father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben's property after Judas has killed his own father.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=234}}\n\nSeveral places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of [[Lyon]] and [[Vienne]] in modern France claim to be Pilate's birthplace: Vienne has a ''Maison de Pilate'', a ''Pr\u00e9toire de Pilate'' and a ''Tour de Pilate''.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} One tradition states the Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called [[Mount Pilatus]]) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 onwards, while [[Lake Lucerne]] has been called \"Pilatus-See\" (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=104\u2013105}} A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany. In addition to Mainz, [[Bamberg]], [[Hausen, Upper Franconia]] were also claimed to be his place of birth, while some traditions place his death in the [[Saarland]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=105\u2013106}} The town of [[Tarragona]] in modern Spain possesses a first-century Roman tower, which, since the eighteenth-century, has been called the \"Torre del Pilatos,\" in which Pilate is claimed to have spent his last years.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} The tradition may go back to a misread Latin inscription on the tower.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=165}} The cities of [[Huesca]] and [[Seville]] are other cities in Spain associated with Pilate.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} Per a local legend,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pontius-pilates-scottish-roots-a-joke-rk0qms770t6 |title=Pontius Pilate's Scottish roots 'a joke' |newspaper=The Times |first=Mark |last=Macaskill |date=2010-01-03 |url-access=limited |access-date=2020-01-17 }}</ref> the village of [[Fortingall]] in Scotland claims to be Pilate's birthplace, but this is almost certainly a 19th century invention&nbsp;\u2013 particularly as the Romans did not invade the British Isles until 43 CE.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/mystery-of-the-5-000-year-old-yew-of-fortingall-1-4292618 |newspaper=The Scotsman |title=Mystery of the '5,000-year-old' yew of Fortingall |first=Alison |last=Campsie |date=2016-11-17 |access-date=2020-01-17 }}</ref>\n\nPilate also continued to be the subject of legends in Eastern Christianity. The Byzantine chronicler [[George Kedrenos]] (c. 1100) wrote that Pilate was condemned by Caligula to die by being left in the sun closed inside the skin of a freshly slaughtered cow together with a chicken, a snake, and a monkey.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=102\u2013103}} In a legend from medieval [[Rus' (region)|Rus']], Pilate attempts in vain to save [[Saint Stephen]] from being executed; Pilate, his wife and children have themselves baptized and bury Stephen in a gilded silver coffin. He then builds a church in the honor of Stephen, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus, who were martyred with Stephen, before he dies seven months later.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=106}} In the medieval [[Slavonic Josephus]], an [[Old Church Slavonic]] translation of Josephus with legendary additions, Pilate kills many of Jesus's followers but finds Jesus innocent.

He eventually becomes a Christian himself.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=366\u2013367}} In the 1493 {{lang|de|Frankfurter Passionsspiel|italics=yes}}, on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=367\u2013368}} The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod's, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=252}} Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe fifteenth-century Roman {{lang|it|Passione|italics=yes}} depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}} In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century {{lang|it|Resurrezione|italics=yes}} and stressing the Jews' fear of the \"new law\" of Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nHourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290, Pilate's characterization may have been used primarily to satyrize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=265}} In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=177\u2013178}} In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan's agent ({{lang|la|mali actoris|italics=yes}}) while plotting Christ's torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=286}} Yet many scholars believe the motif of the conniving devil and the Jews to be inextricably linked. By the thirteenth century, medieval arts and literature had a well-established tradition of the Jew as the Devil in disguise. <ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, some scholars believe that Anti-Judaism still lies near the heart of the matter.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ's torturer to give him Christ's clothes at the foot of the cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=243}} It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297, 328}} In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]], becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=243\u2013245}} In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=213\u2013214}} Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the [[Potter's field]], thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=328}} In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=352}}\n\nThe fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, {{Lang|fr|La Vengeance de Nostre-Seigneur|italics=yes}}, exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ's tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=317}} Another play focusing on Pilate's death is Cornish and based on the {{lang|la|Mors Pilati|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=318}} The {{lang|fr|Myst\u00e8re de la Passion d'Angers|italics=yes}} by [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]] includes legendary scenes of Pilate's life before the passion.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}}\n\n===Modern literature===\nPontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}} One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer [[Anatole France]]'s 1892 short story {{lang|fr|\"Le Procurateur de Jud\u00e9e\"|italics=no}} (\"The Procurator of Judaea\"), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to [[Sicily]]. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=358}} Spending his time at the baths of [[Baiae]], Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}}\n\nPilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1933 play ''[[On the Rocks: A Political Comedy|On the Rocks]]'' where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=195}} Shortly afterwards, French writer [[Roger Caillois]] wrote a novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}}\n\nPilate features prominently in Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty six years after the author's death.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Henry I. MacAdam describes it as \"the 'cult classic' of Pilate-related fiction.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}} The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for \"Pilatism\" by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of ''The Master and Margarita''. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as \"a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=273}} Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|p=165}} Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xiii}} Pilate's burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov's novel.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=371}}\n\nThe majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}} One of Swiss writer [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s earliest stories (\"Pilatus,\" 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}} Swiss playwright [[Max Frisch]]'s comedy {{lang|de|Die chinesische Mauer|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=107\u2013109}} The German Catholic novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]]'s {{lang|de|Die Frau des Pilatus|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate's wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate's guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]] published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled {{lang|ru|Placha|italics=yes}} (''The Place of the Skull''). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as an materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus's teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\n===Film===\nPilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ's passion already in some of the earliest films produced.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=278-2280}} In the 1927 silent film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor [[Victor Varconi]], who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]], which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes \"not power that he possesses but power that possesses him\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=283}} During the ''Ecce homo'' scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=284-285}}\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) portrays Pilate as \"a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire\", with the actor [[Basil Rathbone]] giving him long fingers and a long nose.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=167}} The 1953 film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} The 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' shows Pilate presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says \"seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]],\" with Pilate bored and sneering.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=186}} Martin Winkler, however, argues that ''Ben-Hur'' provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Ponzio Pilato 1962 Marais.png|thumb|Jean Marais as Pontius Pilate in {{lang|it|Ponzio Pilato|italics=yes}} (1962)]]\nOnly one film has been made entirely in Pilate's perspective, the 1962 French-Italian ''[[Ponzio Pilato]]'', where Pilate was played by [[Jean Marais]].{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} In the 1973 film [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|''Jesus Christ Superstar'']], the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and \"the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} The Pilate in the film, played by [[Barry Dennen]], expands on [[John 18:38]] to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough's view, as \"an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} Speaking of Dennen's portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a \"cornered animal.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=290}} Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminancy,{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} illustrated by the Pilate in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', where Pilate lisps and mispronounces his r's as w's. In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), Pilate is played by [[David Bowie]], who appears as \"gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} Bowie's Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus ([[Willem Dafoe]]).{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=290-291}} The trial takes place in Pilate's private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus's death, which he orders without any qualms.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=291-293}}\n\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' portrays Pilate, played by [[Hristo Shopov]], as a sympathetic, noble-minded character,{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities' treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water.{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} McDonough argues that \"Shopov gives US a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=295}}\n\n==Legacy==\nPontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Apostles Creed]]. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=15 July 2019|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302101028/http://cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Nicene Creed states \"For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"<ref>[[s:Nicene Creed (ECUSA Book of Common Prayer)|Nicene Creed in English]]</ref> These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=1}} Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] mentioned by name in the creeds.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=391}} The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=78}}\n\nHe is venerated as a saint by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] with a feast day on June 19,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=11}} and by the [[Coptic Church]], with a feast day of June 25.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=4}}\n\nPilate's washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus's death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination,{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} and is the origin of the English phrase [[Wiktionary:wash one's hands of|\"to wash one's hands of (the matter)\"]], meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something.{{sfn|Martin|2019}} Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the [[Gospel of John]] have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the [[Vulgate]].{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}} These include {{bibleverse|John|18:35|KJV}} ({{Lang|la|numquid ego Iudaeus sum?|italics=yes}} \"Am I a Jew?\"), [[John 18:38]] ({{Lang|la|Quid est veritas?|italics=yes}}; \"what is truth?\"), [[John 19#Verse 5|John 19:5]] ({{Lang|la|[[Ecce homo]]|italics=yes}}, \"Behold the man!\"), {{bibleverse|John|19:14|KJV}} ({{lang|la|Ecce rex vester|italics=yes}}, \"Behold your king!\"), and {{bibleverse|John|19:22|KJV}} ({{lang|la|[[Quod scripsi, scripsi]]|italics=yes}}, \"What I have written, I have written\").{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}}\n\nThe Gospels' deflection of responsibility for Jesus's crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting [[antisemitism]] from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=331\u2013332}}\n\n===Scholarly assessments===\nThe main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels \"comparatively friendly.\"{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=415\u2013416}} This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate's long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\nOn the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was \"a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=363}} However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate's long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator,{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=365}} while Henry MacAdam argues that \"[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=77}} Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nBeginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by [[Sejanus]], that Pilate's offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate's coins.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=9\u201310}} According to this theory, following Sejanus's execution in 31 CE and Tiberius's purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vaciliating attitude at the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=10\u201311}} Helen Bond argues that \"[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate's coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=21}} and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=22}} Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that \"[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.\"{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal| last1=Amora-Stark |first1=Shua |display-authors=etal |title= An Inscribed Copper-Alloy Finger Ring from Herodium Depicting a Krater |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume= 68 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=208\u2013220|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329307909 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Ash |editor-first=Rhiannon |title=Tacitus Annals.

He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and served as [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice Secretary]] and [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Minister]] under the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|Marcos regime]]. He later became one of the leaders (along with General [[Fidel Ramos]]) of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution]] that drove Marcos from power and into exile. Enrile has continued to be a prominent politician since then; he was [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] from November 2008 until his resignation on June 5, 2013.\n\n==Early life and career==\nEnrile was born in [[Gonzaga, Cagayan]] to Petra Furagganan, the stepdaughter of a poor fisherman. He was born out of wedlock\u2014his Spanish ''mestizo'' father was the powerful regional politician and renowned lawyer Alfonso Ponce Enrile, who was already married. His second great-uncle was [[Mariano Ponce]]. As a young man, he was reunited with his father in the [[City of Manila]], and took his secondary education at [[St. James Academy (Malabon)|Saint James Academy]] in [[Malabon]].\n\nHe graduated [[Latin honors|''cum laude'']] in 1949 with an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Afterward, he attended the [[University of the Philippines]] [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]] and graduated ''cum laude'' with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree.  While in law school, he joined the Sigma Rho fraternity. Upon graduation, he was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] international honor societies. He scored 11th in the 1953 [[Philippine Bar Examination|bar examinations]] with a 91.72% rating and a perfect score in mercantile law. As a scholar at the [[Harvard Law School]], he earned a [[Master of Laws]] degree with specialized training in international tax law.\n\nHe taught law at the [[Far Eastern University]] and practiced law in his father's law firm before taking responsibility for then Senator [[Ferdinand Marcos]]'s personal legal affairs in 1964, especially during the latter's term as Senate President.  After Marcos was elected president in 1965, Enrile became part of his inner circle. From 1966 to 1968, he was the Undersecretary and sometime Acting Secretary of the Department of Finance. He concurrently became acting Insurance Commissioner and Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs. From 1968 to 1970, he was the Secretary of Justice.\n\n==Career in the Marcos Cabinet==\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Minister of National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile with President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].]]\n\nEnrile, like Marcos, comes from the northern Philippines, a region that had become Marcos' recruiting ground for key political and military leaders during his time. Enrile was with Marcos since his election in 1965.<ref name=\"ERF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/22/Enrile-and-Ramos-Former-loyalists-turn-on-Marcos/1656509432400/|title=Enrile and Ramos: Former loyalists turn on Marcos|publisher=}}</ref> His campaign efforts were rewarded with an appointment as chief of the Customs Bureau and the government's insurance commission.\n\nThe [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]] would expand its power when Marcos assumed the presidency in 1965. Marcos appointed Enrile as his Secretary of National Defense on February 9, 1970, a position Enrile held until August 27, 1971, when he resigned to run unsuccessfully for the senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/history-the-department-of-national-defense/|title=History: The Department of National Defense|publisher=}}</ref> He was re-appointed Defense Secretary by Marcos on January 4, 1972. As Defense Secretary, he was the highest ranked commissioned officer of a nation's armed forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFrom the beginning of Marcos' period in government, Enrile was one of the few that the former president trusted, and was seen by many as Marcos' prot\u00e9g\u00e9. For almost the entire period of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], Enrile served officially as the martial law administrator as he was in charge of all the armed forces' services during that time. Furthermore, as early as Marcos' planning and preparation for the declaration of martial law, Enrile was involved.<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031757/https://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/ |date=August 11, 2018 }} Why Not Ask Ramos and Enrile About Martial Law Abuses</ref> In his memoir, Enrile recalls Marcos' careful preparations. He narrates that as early as December 1969, Marcos instructed him to study the 1935 Constitution, specifically the powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief. Marcos had already foreseen a rise in violence and chaos in the country and wanted to know the exact extent of his powers.<ref name=\"DML\" />\n                  \t\nAt the end of January of the following year, Enrile, with help from Efren Plana and Minerva Gonzaga Reyes, submitted the only copy of the report regarding the detailed nature and extent of Martial Law to Marcos. Soon after, Marcos allegedly ordered Enrile to prepare all documents necessary for the implementation of [[Martial Law in the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16055240-juan-ponce-enrile | title=Juan Ponce Enrile, A Memoir | publisher=[[ABS-CBN Publishing]] | author=Juan Ponce Enrile | year=2012 | isbn=\n978-9-7181-6117-3 | editor=Navarro, Nelson A. }}</ref> In August 1972, Marcos once again met with Enrile and a few of his other most trusted commanders to discuss tentative dates for the declaration. By September 22, 1972, Marcos announced that he had placed the entire country under Martial Law as of 9 p.m. via proclamation 1081 which, he claimed, he had signed on September 21, 1972.<ref name=\"DML\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ | title=Declaration of Martial Law | work=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014532/https://www.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ | archivedate= September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos Declares Martial Law.jpg|thumb|left|\"FM Declares Martial Law\"\u2014the headline of the September 24, 1972 issue of the ''Sunday Express'', which was the Sunday edition of the ''[[Philippines Daily Express]]''. The ''Daily Express'' was the only newspaper allowed to circulate upon the declaration of Martial Law.]]\n\nOne of Marcos' justifications for the declaration of martial law that year was terrorism. He cited the alleged ambush attack on Enrile's car on September 22, 1972 as pretext for martial law. At the time, many people doubted that the attack actually took place. Marcos, in his diary entry for September 1972, wrote that Enrile had been ambushed near Wack-Wack that night. He says \"it was a good thing he was riding in his security car as a protective measure\u2026 This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity.\"<ref name=\"DML\" /> On the contrary, Oscar Lopez, a resident of Wack-Wack who lived along the street of the alleged ambush, stated that he had heard a lot of shooting on the night of the incident. When he went out to see what was happening, he saw only an empty car riddled with bullets. Lopez' driver, who had happened to witness the incident, stated that \"there was a car that came and stopped beside a Meralco post. Some people exited the car, and another car came by to shoot at the car, to make it look like it was ambushed.\"<ref name=\"DML\" />\n\n[[File:Juan Ponce Enrile's Bullet-riddled car.jpg|thumb|left|Juan Ponce Enrile's bullet-riddled car]]\n \nThe doubts surrounding the alleged ambush were further confirmed in a press conference on February 23, 1986 when then Lieutenant General Fidel Ramos and Enrile admitted that the attack was staged in order to justify the declaration of martial law. Both radio and television media covered this and millions of Filipinos witnessed the said confession. Furthermore, in several interviews, Enrile was reported as indeed confirming that the attempted assassination was faked in order to justify the declaration of Martial Law.<ref name=\"ERF\" /><ref name=\"Inquirer\" >{{cite web | url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/284836/true-or-false-was-1972-enrile-ambush-faked#ixzz4QFSz3iDu | title=True or false: Was 1972 Enrile ambush faked? | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date=October 8, 2012 | accessdate=December 23, 2019 | author=Inquirer Research}}</ref> Conflicting accounts arise in his book, ''Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir''.

In 1973, under the new modified [[parliamentary system]] then in place under the country's new constitution under Martial Law, Enrile's title became Defense Minister. Enrile focused his efforts on a broad review of defense policies and on dealing with pressing social unrest. The abolition of civilian institutions such as [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]], the weakening of the judiciary, and the outlawing of [[Political party|political parties]], left the military as the only other instrumentality of the national government outside of the Presidency.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Historical Institute of the Philippines]], Enrile was also appointed as the general for logging in the Philippines. He was tasked by Marcos to give certificates to logging companies, which eventually led to one of Asia's most devastating environmental disasters. During that time, the forest cover of the Philippines shrank until only 8% remained. Enrile also owned numerous logging companies such as Ameco in Bukidnon, Dolores Timber in Samar, San Jose Timber in Northern Samar, Kasilagan Softwood Development Corp in Butuan, Eurasia Match in Cebu, Pan Oriental which operates in Cebu and Butuan, Palawan-Apitong Corp in Palawan, and Royal Match. He also invested heavily in a rubber plantation in Basilan. A share of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth was siphoned in those companies. Enrile was also appointed by Marcos as the President of the [[Philippine Coconut Authority]], where he established control of the copra industry together with Danding Cojuangco. The two ruled over the controversial Coco Levy Fund which proved their intense corruption in government service. The fund, which was supposed to be used to improve the country's copra industry, was used by the two for programs led by Imelda Marcos and other [[Marcos cronies]]. A huge portion of the fund was also used for the presidential campaigns of Ferdinand Marcos in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5reVY2X8PS0|title=EP09 KAYO ANG HIHIRAP KAMI ANG YAYAMAN|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|date=September 20, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOn November 28, 1978, Marcos issued the Letter of Instruction no. 776, which stated that \"No changes of assignment of senior officers including provincial commanders, brigade commanders, division commanders, and special unit commanders shall be made without clearance from the president.\"<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1978/11/28/letter-of-instruction-no-776-s-1978/] Letter of Instruction No. 776</ref> By the 1980s, Marcos began to bypass Enrile's authority.

He began aligning himself with dissident elements in the army, particularly the [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]] - which was then headed by his [[Aide-de-camp]], Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio Honasan. On February 15, 1986, Aquino's wife, [[Cory Aquino]], gained mass support through her oath taking in protest of Marcos being announced president. This then led to many leaders joining the revolution and fight against Marcos.<ref name=\"Tavaana\"/>\n\nOfficers from the group, with Enrile's support, launched a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against Marcos in February 1986. Marcos was alerted to the plot by Ver, and the conspirators took refuge in two military camps. From there, Enrile and then Lieutenant General [[Fidel Ramos]], the head of the defunct [[Philippine Constabulary]] (it had been integrated with the INP to form the [[Philippine National Police]]) and concurrently vice-chief of staff of the armed forces, rallied opponents against Marcos in a citizens' revolt that became known as the [[People Power Revolution]]. They called on the people to gather in Epifanio de los Santos Avenue ([[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]) to support on February 22. The next three days, they continued their rally in EDSA now containing two million people in support. The growing number encouraged many more leaders to support the movement against Marcos. Enrile stated, \"It was funny.\u2026 We in the defense and military organizations who should be protecting the people were being protected by them.\"<ref name=\"Tavaana\">{{cite web | url=https://tavaana.org/en/en/content/people-power-revolution-philippines-i-saw-no-one-yield-fear | title=People Power Revolution Philippines: I Saw No One Yield | publisher=Tavaana | accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career in the Aquino Cabinet==\nEnrile then served as the Secretary of National Defense under Corazon Aquino, who had replaced Marcos as president, but he increasingly differed with Aquino, specifically on the administration's handling of insurgent leftist opposition. Aquino sought to make peace with the communist party of the Philippines through the use and promotions of ceasefires during which peace talks were to be held between the government and the leftist opposition. Because of such tactics, Enrile was not the only person dissatisfied with Aquino administration. Many of the younger officers in the military who had been identified as members of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement and Marcos loyalists sought to oust Aquino from the presidency with the many coups that were plotted from 1986 to 1990. The earliest and most prominent one was the [[1986-1990 Philippine coup attempts|\"God Save the Queen\" plot]] that was to supposedly be executed on the November 11, 1986.<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-ii-political-change-and-military-transmition-in-the-philippines-1966-1989-from-the-barracks-to-the-corridors-of-power/] Final Report of the Fact Finding Commission</ref> The investigation of the coup done by the Fact Finding Commission found that Enrile and some members of the RAM as the primary instigators of the coup. After revealing the fruits of the investigation findings, Aquino forced Enrile to resign as Defense Secretary in November 1986 as she had lost confidence in him. Enrile was then replaced with [[Rafael Ileto]].\n\n==Congressional career==\n\n===First Senate term===\nIn May 1987 Enrile won a seat in the [[1987 Philippine Senate election|1987 election]] as one of two opposition members in the country's 24-member [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] (the other being [[Joseph Estrada]]), finishing 24th. He was unable to be proclaimed until August, when the electoral protest filed by Augusto Sanchez was dismissed. He formally assumed office on August 15, 1987. In the same month, an [[1986\u20131987 Philippine coup attempts|attempted coup against Aquino]] escalated and led to the destruction of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]] General Headquarters (AFPGHQ) in [[Camp Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]]. He was detained in Camp Aguinaldo over suspicion of planning the coup with Lt. Col. [[Gregorio Honasan]], but was released days later for lack of evidence. Enrile later stated numerous recalls about the martial law era, of which all were flip-flops from his previous statements during his term a secretary of defense and during the ouster of Marcos. He was dubbed by then-President [[Corazon Aquino]] as \"''Pambansang Balimbing''\" (national political turncoat) for his contradicting statements and \"''Dakilang Miron''\" (great bystander) for his inconvenient bystander and opportunistic attitude.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d8JJzuks0Q&t=13s|title=President Corazon Aquino blasts Enrile and coup rebels at EDSA (1990)|first=|last=Maypagasa|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\n===Member of the House of Representatives===\nIn 1992, before his term in the Senate had ended, Enrile predicted that he might lose the senatorial election or win, but only serve three years in office. Under the transitory provisions of the [[Philippine Constitution|1987 Constitution]], the 12 candidates who receive the greatest number of votes serve a six-year term, the next 12 only three years. He ran instead for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. He [[1992 Philippine House of Representatives elections|was elected]] and represented the First District of [[Cagayan]].\n\n===Second to fourth senate terms===\nIn 1995 Enrile ran in the senatorial race as an independent candidate for [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and was also a guest candidate under the [[Lakas NUCD|Lakas]]&ndash;[[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino|Laban]] coalition. He [[1995 Philippine Senate election|won as senator]] and held the position until 2001. During his term as senator, he ran as an independent candidate in the [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998 election]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He lost to then [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] Joseph Estrada.\n\nOn January 13, 2001 he was one of those who voted against the opening of the second bank envelope.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} That vote led to the [[EDSA II|second EDSA People Power Revolution]] that eventually ousted President Estrada. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], [[Gregorio Honasan]], [[Panfilo Lacson]] and [[Vicente Sotto III]], he led the [[EDSA III]] protests in support of [[Joseph Estrada]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/90521/miriam-gma-resign-or-we-will-storm-palace|title= Miriam to GMA: Resign or we will storm palace\n|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|date=April 30, 2001|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"EDSA INC\" />  May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]].<ref name=\"EDSA INC\" >{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/104045-edsa-3-iglesia-ni-cristo|title= Remembering the Iglesia-led EDSA 3\n|work=[[Rappler]]|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref> In May 2001 he was indicted by the military for the investigation of the unsuccessful siege of the [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]] by pro-Estrada forces. He was released a day later. He ran for [[2001 Philippine Senate election|reelection]] as part of the [[Puwersa ng Masa]] coalition. Due to the issues that haunted him over the failed siege, he lost the election.\n\nIn the [[2004 Philippine Senate election|2004 election]], he made a comeback bid for the Senate under the [[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]] (KNP) banner. He actively opposed the imposition of the Purchased Power Adjustment (PPA) on consumers' electric bills. Due to his expos\u00e9 of the PPA and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decision in favour of a refund on electric bills, the public responded positively and elected him. He thus became a senator in three non-consecutive terms. He was reelected as senator in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 election]]s. {{asof|2013}}, he is the oldest senator of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines]]. Enrile is affiliated with the [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino]] (PMP). Technically he belongs to an opposition party, but in the Senate, he stands as an independent and is part of the administration bloc. The minority bloc includes all of his party's members.\n\n==Senate Presidency==\n\n===Election===\nOn November 17, 2008, Senate President [[Manuel Villar]] resigned due to lack of support, and Enrile succeeded him the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|title=easybourse.com, Senators Name Juan Ponce Enrile As New Philippine Senate President|access-date=November 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221140806/http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=ABS>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/08/enrile-ousts-villar-senate-coup|title=(Update) Enrile ousts Villar in Senate coup|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm news.xinhuanet.com, Philippine senate president resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153448/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm |date=December 21, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/133995/Zubiri-is-new-Senate-Majority-Leader|title=Zubiri is new Senate Majority Leader|publisher=}}</ref> Enrile was nominated by [[Panfilo Lacson]]; 14 senators supported the nomination and five abstained.<ref name=ABS/> Enrile accepted the position, saying that \"To lead the Senate with its great minds, strong advocacies, varying and independent political beliefs and leanings, is not an easy task.

Institutional reforms were also implemented within the Senate to improve the daily conduct of business as well the welfare of its officers and employees.\n\n===Maguindanao martial law===\nThe Senate also collaborated with the House of Representatives on two crucial issues which are now considered historical milestones. In December 2009, it used Proclamation No. 1959 of the previous administration, declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the province of Maguindanao, while in May 2010, Congress convened to constitute itself as the national board to canvass the votes for president and vice president, and proclaim the winners.\n\n===Re-election as Senate President===\n[[File:Hajime Ishii and Juan Ponce Enrile 20110504.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Hajime Ishii]] (left) on May 4, 2011]]\n\nEnrile was re-elected to a fourth term in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 Senate election]]. On July 26, 2010, he was re-elected President of the Senate. Enrile committed himself to \"discharge my duties and responsibilities with honor, with total devotion to our institution, and with fairness to all members. No partisan consideration will blur or color the treatment of any member of the Senate. We are all Senators elected by the people to serve them with dedication to their interest and well-being and devotion to our responsibilities.\" Furthermore, in his acceptance speech, he enjoined his colleagues to \"uphold the independence and integrity of this Senate, without abandoning our duty to cooperate with the other departments of the government to achieve what is good for our people.\"<ref>[https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senpres/enrile.asp] Biography of Senate Presidents - Juan Ponce Enrile.

He was one of the 20 Senators voting guilty for the impeachment. In September 2012 he started a feud with [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] when he asked Trillanes why he secretly visited [[Beijing]] to talk about the [[Philippines and the Spratly Islands]] dispute on [[Spratlys]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal]]. Trillanes said his visit in China was authorized by the [[Malaca\u00f1an|Palace]]. He also alleged that Enrile was being pushed by former Pres. [[Gloria Arroyo]] to pass a bill splitting the province of [[Camarines Sur]] into two but Enrile denied the allegation.\n\nIn late 2012, Enrile also started a feud with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] when Santiago authored the [[Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012]] with [[Pia Cayetano]], which he opposed. In January 2013, Santiago exposed that Enrile allegedly gave PhP 1.6 million each to his fellow Senators, except for her, [[Pia Cayetano]], [[Alan Peter Cayetano]], and Trillanes, who were reportedly to have been only given PhP 250 thousand each. He admitted giving the said amount to the senators, saying it was part of the balance of the maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) funds allowed per senator. On January 21, 2013, because of the controversies involving him, he attempted to vacate his position as Senate President but his motion was rejected.\n\n===Resignation===\nAmid accusations against him, including the alleged distribution of MOOE funds to senators, Enrile stepped down as Senate President after his privilege speech on June 5, 2013.<ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/311510/news/nation/enrile-resigns-as-senate-president Enrile resigns as Senate president] retrieved June 5, 2013</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\n===Enrile cash gift===\nIn January 2013, while sitting as the Senate President, Enrile was accused of using Senate funds called MOOE as Christmas gifts to members of the senate who do not oppose him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/19395-enrile-s-cash-gifts-exclude-4-critics|title=Enrile's 'cash gifts' exclude 4 critics|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/337461/enrile-gave-18-senators-p1-6m-each-for-christmas|title=Enrile gave 18 senators P1.6M each for Christmas|first=Juliet|last=Labog-Javellana|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/289408/news/nation/enrile-gave-p1-6m-to-all-fellow-senators-except-his-foes|title=Enrile gave P1.6M to all fellow senators except his foes|publisher=}}</ref> This led to his resignation as Senate President without sufficiently answering the controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/421361/enrile-quits-slams-critics|title=Enrile quits, slams critics|first=Cathy|last=Yamsuan|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Pork barrel scam===\n{{main|Priority Development Assistance Fund scam}}\n[[File:Bong Revilla after delivering \"Salamat, Kaibigan\".jpg|thumb|200px|Enrile with Senators [[Jinggoy Estrada]] (left) and [[Bong Revilla]] (center) after Revilla's Privilege Speech at the Senate floor on June 9, 2014]]\n\nIn September 2013, Enrile was again involved in misappropriated funds, this time with regard to the PDAF or what is commonly called the [[pork barrel]] fund.

He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and served as [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice Secretary]] and [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Minister]] under the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|Marcos regime]]. He later became one of the leaders (along with General [[Fidel Ramos]]) of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution]] that drove Marcos from power and into exile. Enrile has continued to be a prominent politician since then; he was [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] from November 2008 until his resignation on June 5, 2013.\n\n==Early life and career==\nEnrile was born in [[Gonzaga, Cagayan]] to Petra Furagganan, the stepdaughter of a poor fisherman. He was born out of wedlock\u2014his Spanish ''mestizo'' father was the powerful regional politician and renowned lawyer Alfonso Ponce Enrile, who was already married. His second great-uncle was [[Mariano Ponce]]. As a young man, he was reunited with his father in the [[City of Manila]], and took his secondary education at [[St. James Academy (Malabon)|Saint James Academy]] in [[Malabon]].\n\nHe graduated [[Latin honors|''cum laude'']] in 1949 with an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Afterward, he attended the [[University of the Philippines]] [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]] and graduated ''cum laude'' with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree.  While in law school, he joined the Sigma Rho fraternity. Upon graduation, he was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] international honor societies. He scored 11th in the 1953 [[Philippine Bar Examination|bar examinations]] with a 91.72% rating and a perfect score in mercantile law. As a scholar at the [[Harvard Law School]], he earned a [[Master of Laws]] degree with specialized training in international tax law.\n\nHe taught law at the [[Far Eastern University]] and practiced law in his father's law firm before taking responsibility for then Senator [[Ferdinand Marcos]]'s personal legal affairs in 1964, especially during the latter's term as Senate President.  After Marcos was elected president in 1965, Enrile became part of his inner circle. From 1966 to 1968, he was the Undersecretary and sometime Acting Secretary of the Department of Finance. He concurrently became acting Insurance Commissioner and Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs. From 1968 to 1970, he was the Secretary of Justice.\n\n==Career in the Marcos Cabinet==\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Minister of National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile with President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].]]\n\nEnrile, like Marcos, comes from the northern Philippines, a region that had become Marcos' recruiting ground for key political and military leaders during his time. Enrile was with Marcos since his election in 1965.<ref name=\"ERF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/22/Enrile-and-Ramos-Former-loyalists-turn-on-Marcos/1656509432400/|title=Enrile and Ramos: Former loyalists turn on Marcos|publisher=}}</ref> His campaign efforts were rewarded with an appointment as chief of the Customs Bureau and the government's insurance commission.\n\nThe [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]] would expand its power when Marcos assumed the presidency in 1965. Marcos appointed Enrile as his Secretary of National Defense on February 9, 1970, a position Enrile held until August 27, 1971, when he resigned to run unsuccessfully for the senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/history-the-department-of-national-defense/|title=History: The Department of National Defense|publisher=}}</ref> He was re-appointed Defense Secretary by Marcos on January 4, 1972. As Defense Secretary, he was the highest ranked commissioned officer of a nation's armed forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFrom the beginning of Marcos' period in government, Enrile was one of the few that the former president trusted, and was seen by many as Marcos' prot\u00e9g\u00e9. For almost the entire period of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], Enrile served officially as the martial law administrator as he was in charge of all the armed forces' services during that time. Furthermore, as early as Marcos' planning and preparation for the declaration of martial law, Enrile was involved.<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031757/https://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/ |date=August 11, 2018 }} Why Not Ask Ramos and Enrile About Martial Law Abuses</ref> In his memoir, Enrile recalls Marcos' careful preparations. He narrates that as early as December 1969, Marcos instructed him to study the 1935 Constitution, specifically the powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief. Marcos had already foreseen a rise in violence and chaos in the country and wanted to know the exact extent of his powers.<ref name=\"DML\" />\n                  \t\nAt the end of January of the following year, Enrile, with help from Efren Plana and Minerva Gonzaga Reyes, submitted the only copy of the report regarding the detailed nature and extent of Martial Law to Marcos. Soon after, Marcos allegedly ordered Enrile to prepare all documents necessary for the implementation of [[Martial Law in the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16055240-juan-ponce-enrile | title=Juan Ponce Enrile, A Memoir | publisher=[[ABS-CBN Publishing]] | author=Juan Ponce Enrile | year=2012 | isbn=\n978-9-7181-6117-3 | editor=Navarro, Nelson A. }}</ref> In August 1972, Marcos once again met with Enrile and a few of his other most trusted commanders to discuss tentative dates for the declaration. By September 22, 1972, Marcos announced that he had placed the entire country under Martial Law as of 9 p.m. via proclamation 1081 which, he claimed, he had signed on September 21, 1972.<ref name=\"DML\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ | title=Declaration of Martial Law | work=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014532/https://www.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ | archivedate= September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos Declares Martial Law.jpg|thumb|left|\"FM Declares Martial Law\"\u2014the headline of the September 24, 1972 issue of the ''Sunday Express'', which was the Sunday edition of the ''[[Philippines Daily Express]]''. The ''Daily Express'' was the only newspaper allowed to circulate upon the declaration of Martial Law.]]\n\nOne of Marcos' justifications for the declaration of martial law that year was terrorism. He cited the alleged ambush attack on Enrile's car on September 22, 1972 as pretext for martial law. At the time, many people doubted that the attack actually took place. Marcos, in his diary entry for September 1972, wrote that Enrile had been ambushed near Wack-Wack that night. He says \"it was a good thing he was riding in his security car as a protective measure\u2026 This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity.\"<ref name=\"DML\" /> On the contrary, Oscar Lopez, a resident of Wack-Wack who lived along the street of the alleged ambush, stated that he had heard a lot of shooting on the night of the incident. When he went out to see what was happening, he saw only an empty car riddled with bullets. Lopez' driver, who had happened to witness the incident, stated that \"there was a car that came and stopped beside a Meralco post. Some people exited the car, and another car came by to shoot at the car, to make it look like it was ambushed.\"<ref name=\"DML\" />\n\n[[File:Juan Ponce Enrile's Bullet-riddled car.jpg|thumb|left|Juan Ponce Enrile's bullet-riddled car]]\n \nThe doubts surrounding the alleged ambush were further confirmed in a press conference on February 23, 1986 when then Lieutenant General Fidel Ramos and Enrile admitted that the attack was staged in order to justify the declaration of martial law. Both radio and television media covered this and millions of Filipinos witnessed the said confession. Furthermore, in several interviews, Enrile was reported as indeed confirming that the attempted assassination was faked in order to justify the declaration of Martial Law.<ref name=\"ERF\" /><ref name=\"Inquirer\" >{{cite web | url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/284836/true-or-false-was-1972-enrile-ambush-faked#ixzz4QFSz3iDu | title=True or false: Was 1972 Enrile ambush faked? | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date=October 8, 2012 | accessdate=December 23, 2019 | author=Inquirer Research}}</ref> Conflicting accounts arise in his book, ''Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir''.

In 1973, under the new modified [[parliamentary system]] then in place under the country's new constitution under Martial Law, Enrile's title became Defense Minister. Enrile focused his efforts on a broad review of defense policies and on dealing with pressing social unrest. The abolition of civilian institutions such as [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]], the weakening of the judiciary, and the outlawing of [[Political party|political parties]], left the military as the only other instrumentality of the national government outside of the Presidency.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Historical Institute of the Philippines]], Enrile was also appointed as the general for logging in the Philippines. He was tasked by Marcos to give certificates to logging companies, which eventually led to one of Asia's most devastating environmental disasters. During that time, the forest cover of the Philippines shrank until only 8% remained. Enrile also owned numerous logging companies such as Ameco in Bukidnon, Dolores Timber in Samar, San Jose Timber in Northern Samar, Kasilagan Softwood Development Corp in Butuan, Eurasia Match in Cebu, Pan Oriental which operates in Cebu and Butuan, Palawan-Apitong Corp in Palawan, and Royal Match. He also invested heavily in a rubber plantation in Basilan. A share of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth was siphoned in those companies. Enrile was also appointed by Marcos as the President of the [[Philippine Coconut Authority]], where he established control of the copra industry together with Danding Cojuangco. The two ruled over the controversial Coco Levy Fund which proved their intense corruption in government service. The fund, which was supposed to be used to improve the country's copra industry, was used by the two for programs led by Imelda Marcos and other [[Marcos cronies]]. A huge portion of the fund was also used for the presidential campaigns of Ferdinand Marcos in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5reVY2X8PS0|title=EP09 KAYO ANG HIHIRAP KAMI ANG YAYAMAN|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|date=September 20, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOn November 28, 1978, Marcos issued the Letter of Instruction no. 776, which stated that \"No changes of assignment of senior officers including provincial commanders, brigade commanders, division commanders, and special unit commanders shall be made without clearance from the president.\"<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1978/11/28/letter-of-instruction-no-776-s-1978/] Letter of Instruction No. 776</ref> By the 1980s, Marcos began to bypass Enrile's authority.

He began aligning himself with dissident elements in the army, particularly the [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]] - which was then headed by his [[Aide-de-camp]], Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio Honasan. On February 15, 1986, Aquino's wife, [[Cory Aquino]], gained mass support through her oath taking in protest of Marcos being announced president. This then led to many leaders joining the revolution and fight against Marcos.<ref name=\"Tavaana\"/>\n\nOfficers from the group, with Enrile's support, launched a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against Marcos in February 1986. Marcos was alerted to the plot by Ver, and the conspirators took refuge in two military camps. From there, Enrile and then Lieutenant General [[Fidel Ramos]], the head of the defunct [[Philippine Constabulary]] (it had been integrated with the INP to form the [[Philippine National Police]]) and concurrently vice-chief of staff of the armed forces, rallied opponents against Marcos in a citizens' revolt that became known as the [[People Power Revolution]]. They called on the people to gather in Epifanio de los Santos Avenue ([[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]) to support on February 22. The next three days, they continued their rally in EDSA now containing two million people in support. The growing number encouraged many more leaders to support the movement against Marcos. Enrile stated, \"It was funny.\u2026 We in the defense and military organizations who should be protecting the people were being protected by them.\"<ref name=\"Tavaana\">{{cite web | url=https://tavaana.org/en/en/content/people-power-revolution-philippines-i-saw-no-one-yield-fear | title=People Power Revolution Philippines: I Saw No One Yield | publisher=Tavaana | accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career in the Aquino Cabinet==\nEnrile then served as the Secretary of National Defense under Corazon Aquino, who had replaced Marcos as president, but he increasingly differed with Aquino, specifically on the administration's handling of insurgent leftist opposition. Aquino sought to make peace with the communist party of the Philippines through the use and promotions of ceasefires during which peace talks were to be held between the government and the leftist opposition. Because of such tactics, Enrile was not the only person dissatisfied with Aquino administration. Many of the younger officers in the military who had been identified as members of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement and Marcos loyalists sought to oust Aquino from the presidency with the many coups that were plotted from 1986 to 1990. The earliest and most prominent one was the [[1986-1990 Philippine coup attempts|\"God Save the Queen\" plot]] that was to supposedly be executed on the November 11, 1986.<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-ii-political-change-and-military-transmition-in-the-philippines-1966-1989-from-the-barracks-to-the-corridors-of-power/] Final Report of the Fact Finding Commission</ref> The investigation of the coup done by the Fact Finding Commission found that Enrile and some members of the RAM as the primary instigators of the coup. After revealing the fruits of the investigation findings, Aquino forced Enrile to resign as Defense Secretary in November 1986 as she had lost confidence in him. Enrile was then replaced with [[Rafael Ileto]].\n\n==Congressional career==\n\n===First Senate term===\nIn May 1987 Enrile won a seat in the [[1987 Philippine Senate election|1987 election]] as one of two opposition members in the country's 24-member [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] (the other being [[Joseph Estrada]]), finishing 24th. He was unable to be proclaimed until August, when the electoral protest filed by Augusto Sanchez was dismissed. He formally assumed office on August 15, 1987. In the same month, an [[1986\u20131987 Philippine coup attempts|attempted coup against Aquino]] escalated and led to the destruction of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]] General Headquarters (AFPGHQ) in [[Camp Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]]. He was detained in Camp Aguinaldo over suspicion of planning the coup with Lt. Col. [[Gregorio Honasan]], but was released days later for lack of evidence. Enrile later stated numerous recalls about the martial law era, of which all were flip-flops from his previous statements during his term a secretary of defense and during the ouster of Marcos. He was dubbed by then-President [[Corazon Aquino]] as \"''Pambansang Balimbing''\" (national political turncoat) for his contradicting statements and \"''Dakilang Miron''\" (great bystander) for his inconvenient bystander and opportunistic attitude.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d8JJzuks0Q&t=13s|title=President Corazon Aquino blasts Enrile and coup rebels at EDSA (1990)|first=|last=Maypagasa|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\n===Member of the House of Representatives===\nIn 1992, before his term in the Senate had ended, Enrile predicted that he might lose the senatorial election or win, but only serve three years in office. Under the transitory provisions of the [[Philippine Constitution|1987 Constitution]], the 12 candidates who receive the greatest number of votes serve a six-year term, the next 12 only three years. He ran instead for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. He [[1992 Philippine House of Representatives elections|was elected]] and represented the First District of [[Cagayan]].\n\n===Second to fourth senate terms===\nIn 1995 Enrile ran in the senatorial race as an independent candidate for [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and was also a guest candidate under the [[Lakas NUCD|Lakas]]&ndash;[[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino|Laban]] coalition. He [[1995 Philippine Senate election|won as senator]] and held the position until 2001. During his term as senator, he ran as an independent candidate in the [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998 election]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He lost to then [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] Joseph Estrada.\n\nOn January 13, 2001 he was one of those who voted against the opening of the second bank envelope.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} That vote led to the [[EDSA II|second EDSA People Power Revolution]] that eventually ousted President Estrada. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], [[Gregorio Honasan]], [[Panfilo Lacson]] and [[Vicente Sotto III]], he led the [[EDSA III]] protests in support of [[Joseph Estrada]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/90521/miriam-gma-resign-or-we-will-storm-palace|title= Miriam to GMA: Resign or we will storm palace\n|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|date=April 30, 2001|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"EDSA INC\" />  May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]].<ref name=\"EDSA INC\" >{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/104045-edsa-3-iglesia-ni-cristo|title= Remembering the Iglesia-led EDSA 3\n|work=[[Rappler]]|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref> In May 2001 he was indicted by the military for the investigation of the unsuccessful siege of the [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]] by pro-Estrada forces. He was released a day later. He ran for [[2001 Philippine Senate election|reelection]] as part of the [[Puwersa ng Masa]] coalition. Due to the issues that haunted him over the failed siege, he lost the election.\n\nIn the [[2004 Philippine Senate election|2004 election]], he made a comeback bid for the Senate under the [[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]] (KNP) banner. He actively opposed the imposition of the Purchased Power Adjustment (PPA) on consumers' electric bills. Due to his expos\u00e9 of the PPA and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decision in favour of a refund on electric bills, the public responded positively and elected him. He thus became a senator in three non-consecutive terms. He was reelected as senator in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 election]]s. {{asof|2013}}, he is the oldest senator of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines]]. Enrile is affiliated with the [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino]] (PMP). Technically he belongs to an opposition party, but in the Senate, he stands as an independent and is part of the administration bloc. The minority bloc includes all of his party's members.\n\n==Senate Presidency==\n\n===Election===\nOn November 17, 2008, Senate President [[Manuel Villar]] resigned due to lack of support, and Enrile succeeded him the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|title=easybourse.com, Senators Name Juan Ponce Enrile As New Philippine Senate President|access-date=November 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221140806/http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=ABS>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/08/enrile-ousts-villar-senate-coup|title=(Update) Enrile ousts Villar in Senate coup|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm news.xinhuanet.com, Philippine senate president resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153448/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm |date=December 21, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/133995/Zubiri-is-new-Senate-Majority-Leader|title=Zubiri is new Senate Majority Leader|publisher=}}</ref> Enrile was nominated by [[Panfilo Lacson]]; 14 senators supported the nomination and five abstained.<ref name=ABS/> Enrile accepted the position, saying that \"To lead the Senate with its great minds, strong advocacies, varying and independent political beliefs and leanings, is not an easy task. But it is precisely this variance in points of view and the battle of great ideas that provide the dynamism we need to craft legislation that takes into account and balances the competing interests involved \u2013 with the end in view of serving the greater good of the people to whom we owe our mandate.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Legislation===\nUnder his leadership, the Senate passed vital pieces of legislation such as the CARP Extension, Anti-Torture Act, Expanded Senior Citizens Act, Anti-Child Pornography Act, National Heritage Conservation Act, Real Estate Investment Act, among many others. Institutional reforms were also implemented within the Senate to improve the daily conduct of business as well the welfare of its officers and employees.\n\n===Maguindanao martial law===\nThe Senate also collaborated with the House of Representatives on two crucial issues which are now considered historical milestones. In December 2009, it used Proclamation No. 1959 of the previous administration, declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the province of Maguindanao, while in May 2010, Congress convened to constitute itself as the national board to canvass the votes for president and vice president, and proclaim the winners.\n\n===Re-election as Senate President===\n[[File:Hajime Ishii and Juan Ponce Enrile 20110504.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Hajime Ishii]] (left) on May 4, 2011]]\n\nEnrile was re-elected to a fourth term in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 Senate election]]. On July 26, 2010, he was re-elected President of the Senate. Enrile committed himself to \"discharge my duties and responsibilities with honor, with total devotion to our institution, and with fairness to all members. No partisan consideration will blur or color the treatment of any member of the Senate. We are all Senators elected by the people to serve them with dedication to their interest and well-being and devotion to our responsibilities.\" Furthermore, in his acceptance speech, he enjoined his colleagues to \"uphold the independence and integrity of this Senate, without abandoning our duty to cooperate with the other departments of the government to achieve what is good for our people.\"<ref>[https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senpres/enrile.asp] Biography of Senate Presidents - Juan Ponce Enrile. Retrieved November 29, 2016</ref>\n\n===Corona's impeachment, various feuds, and controversies===\nIn early 2012 Enrile was the presiding officer of the [[Impeachment of Renato Corona|Impeachment of Chief Justice Renato Corona]]. He was one of the 20 Senators voting guilty for the impeachment. In September 2012 he started a feud with [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] when he asked Trillanes why he secretly visited [[Beijing]] to talk about the [[Philippines and the Spratly Islands]] dispute on [[Spratlys]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal]]. Trillanes said his visit in China was authorized by the [[Malaca\u00f1an|Palace]]. He also alleged that Enrile was being pushed by former Pres. [[Gloria Arroyo]] to pass a bill splitting the province of [[Camarines Sur]] into two but Enrile denied the allegation.\n\nIn late 2012, Enrile also started a feud with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] when Santiago authored the [[Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012]] with [[Pia Cayetano]], which he opposed. In January 2013, Santiago exposed that Enrile allegedly gave PhP 1.6 million each to his fellow Senators, except for her, [[Pia Cayetano]], [[Alan Peter Cayetano]], and Trillanes, who were reportedly to have been only given PhP 250 thousand each. He admitted giving the said amount to the senators, saying it was part of the balance of the maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) funds allowed per senator. On January 21, 2013, because of the controversies involving him, he attempted to vacate his position as Senate President but his motion was rejected.\n\n===Resignation===\nAmid accusations against him, including the alleged distribution of MOOE funds to senators, Enrile stepped down as Senate President after his privilege speech on June 5, 2013.<ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/311510/news/nation/enrile-resigns-as-senate-president Enrile resigns as Senate president] retrieved June 5, 2013</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\n===Enrile cash gift===\nIn January 2013, while sitting as the Senate President, Enrile was accused of using Senate funds called MOOE as Christmas gifts to members of the senate who do not oppose him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/19395-enrile-s-cash-gifts-exclude-4-critics|title=Enrile's 'cash gifts' exclude 4 critics|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/337461/enrile-gave-18-senators-p1-6m-each-for-christmas|title=Enrile gave 18 senators P1.6M each for Christmas|first=Juliet|last=Labog-Javellana|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/289408/news/nation/enrile-gave-p1-6m-to-all-fellow-senators-except-his-foes|title=Enrile gave P1.6M to all fellow senators except his foes|publisher=}}</ref> This led to his resignation as Senate President without sufficiently answering the controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/421361/enrile-quits-slams-critics|title=Enrile quits, slams critics|first=Cathy|last=Yamsuan|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Pork barrel scam===\n{{main|Priority Development Assistance Fund scam}}\n[[File:Bong Revilla after delivering \"Salamat, Kaibigan\".jpg|thumb|200px|Enrile with Senators [[Jinggoy Estrada]] (left) and [[Bong Revilla]] (center) after Revilla's Privilege Speech at the Senate floor on June 9, 2014]]\n\nIn September 2013, Enrile was again involved in misappropriated funds, this time with regard to the PDAF or what is commonly called the [[pork barrel]] fund.

Fifteen soldiers of the Aviation Security Command had been sentenced to double life imprisonment for the double murder of Aquino and his alleged lone communist gunman, [[Rolando Galman]], and one of them had since died.
