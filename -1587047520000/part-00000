The screenplay by [[Kurt Wimmer]] and [[Mark Bomback]] was based on the [[Total Recall (1990 film)|1990 film of the same name]], which was inspired by the 1966 short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. The film stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Kate Beckinsale]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Bokeem Woodbine]], [[John Cho]], and [[Bill Nighy]]. Unlike the first film, the setting is on a [[dystopian]] Earth, not Mars, and has more political themes.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1683538/total-recall-len-wiseman.jhtml |title=Total Recall remake heads in 'a different direction' from original |work=MTV |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |last=Warner |first=Kara}}</ref> The film blends American and Asian influences, notably in the settings and dominant populations of the two nation-states in the story: the United Federation of Britain (Western Europe) and the Colony (Australia).\n\nThe film was first announced in 2009<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=53284 |title=A Total Recall Remake is Very Real |work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=CraveOnline |date=February 26, 2009 |accessdate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> and was released in North America on August 3, 2012, grossing over $198 million worldwide.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=totalrecall2012.htm|title= Total Recall (2012) Total Lifetime Grosses|accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/sony-schedules-total-recall-august-2012-dates-i-hate-dad-kevin-james-mma-film |title=Sony Schedules 'Total Recall' For August 2012, Also Dates 'I Hate You, Dad' And Kevin James' MMA Film |last=Fischer |first=Russ |work=/Film |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> The film received generally negative reviews from critics. It received praise for its action sequences and acting, but the lack of humor, emotional subtlety, and character development drew some criticism. \n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:Filmplot, a plot section should not exceed 700 words. Please do not add excessive details. --> \nAt the end of the 21st century, Earth is devastated by [[chemical warfare]]. Precious remaining habitable land is found in just two territories: the United Federation of Britain (UFB), located on the British Isles and northwestern Europe; and the Colony, covering Australia. Factory workers living in the Colony quickly commute to the UFB each day via \u201cThe Fall,\u201d a [[Gravity train|gravity elevator]] through the Earth's core which takes 17 minutes to traverse. A Resistance operating in the UFB, which the UFB views as a terrorist movement, seeks to improve living conditions in the Colony.\n\nColony citizen Douglas Quaid has been having dreams of being a secret agent, aided by an unnamed woman. Tired of his factory job building police robots with friend Harry, he visits Rekall, a company that implants artificial memories. Quaid chooses a fantasy as a secret agent. An emblem of Rekall is stamped onto his arm and, just as the fantasy is being loaded by technician McClane, they discover that Quaid already has real memories of being a spy. As McClane starts to question Quaid about the memories, a squad of UFB police burst in, kill the Rekall staff, and attempt to arrest Quaid. Quaid reacts instinctively, killing the entire squad. Upon returning home his wife Lori attempts to kill him, revealing that she is a UFB intelligence agent and they've only been \u201cmarried\u201d for six weeks, not seven years. After Quaid escapes, Charles Hammond, stating he is an old friend, contacts him and directs him to a safe-deposit box, where Quaid finds a message from himself with the address of an apartment.\n\nPursued by Lori, human and robot police, Quaid is rescued by Melina, the woman from his dreams. At the apartment, Quaid finds another recording, revealing that he is actually Carl Hauser, an agent working for UFB Chancellor Cohaagen to infiltrate the Resistance. Hauser defected, but was recaptured by the UFB and implanted with [[False memory|false memories]] to manipulate him. The recording reveals that Cohaagen will use robots to wipe out the Colony, replace the Colonists as laborers, and give the UFB more living space. Hauser has seen a \u201ckill code\u201d,  which can be recovered from his memory by Resistance leader Matthias, that will disable the robots. Melina reveals that she was Hauser's lover before he was recaptured, comparing their matching scars from a time they were shot while holding hands. The police arrive and Harry appears. He tries to convince Quaid that he is still in a Rekall-induced dream and that killing Melina is the only way out. Quaid is unsure, but notices a tear on Melina's cheek and shoots Harry. Lori pursues the pair, but they escape.\n\nQuaid and Melina find Matthias. While Matthias searches Quaid's memories, Lori and Cohaagen storm the Resistance base. Cohaagen reveals that Hauser was in fact still working for him<!--Note: In theatrical version, Cohaagen mentioned Hauser has been \"corrupted\", which suggested Hauser did in fact go rogue.--> and contributed to Quaid's memory alteration, dreaming up the kill code as a trap. Cohaagen kills Matthias, takes Melina prisoner, and leaves Hauser for pre-Quaid memory restoration. As the officers are about to inject Quaid, Hammond reveals himself and dies helping Quaid escape.\n\nCohaagen loads The Fall with his invasion army of robots. Quaid sneaks on board, setting timed explosives throughout the ship while searching for Melina. He frees her as The Fall arrives at the Colony. As they fight the soldiers and Cohaagen, Quaid's explosives detonate. Quaid and Melina jump off before the ship plummets back into the tunnel and explodes underground, killing Cohaagen and destroying his army and The Fall itself &ndash; the only way to reach the UFB.\n\nWaking up in an ambulance, Quaid is greeted by Melina. When he notices that she is missing their matching hand scar, he realizes that she is Lori using a holographic disguise; they fight and Lori is killed. Quaid finds the real Melina as news channels declare the independence of the Colony and an advertisement for Rekall plays on a billboard in the background.\n\n=== Alternative ending ===\nIn the extended director's cut, Quaid notices that the emblem mark he had gotten at Rekall prior to all that has happened is no longer visible on his arm, suggesting that he is still living a fantasy within the Rekall mainframe.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order and roles as displayed --->\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Douglas Quaid/Hauser, a factory worker suffering from strange violent dreams.<ref name=\"Collin\" />\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Lori, a UFB undercover agent posing as Quaid's wife.<ref name=\"Kate\" />\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Melina, a member of the Resistance and love interest.<ref name=\"Kate\" />\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Cohaagen, the corrupt and ruthless [[Chancellor]] of the United Federation of Britain.<ref name=\"Cranston\" />\n* [[Bokeem Woodbine]] as Harry, Quaid's workmate and best friend \u2013 in fact an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor him.\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Matthias, the leader of the Resistance.<ref name=\"Kuato\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/open-your-mind-to-bill-nighy-as-the-new-kuato-in-the-remake-of-total-recall |title=Open your mind to Bill Nighy as the new Kuato in the remake of Total Recall |work=Jablo.com |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[John Cho]] as McClane, a rep and tech at Rekall who offers Quaid the chance to experience an imagined adventure.<ref name=\"Cho\" />\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as Marek, a factory worker who refers Quaid to McClane at Rekall.\n* [[Dylan Smith (Canadian actor)|Dylan Smith]] (credited as Dylan Scott Smith) as Hammond\n\n==Production==\nOn June 2, 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Kurt Wimmer]] would write the script for the film.<ref name=\"VarietyJune2009\">{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451?refCatId=13 |title=Wimmer to write 'Total Recall' remake |last=Fleming |first=Mike |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128163539/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451?refCatId=13 |archive-date=January 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Mark Bomback]] was later brought on board,<ref name=\"Release\" /> and [[James Vanderbilt]] did an uncredited \"polish\" on the script.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-vanderbilt-returning-pen-spider-171190 |title=James Vanderbilt Returning to Pen 'Spider-Man' Sequel (Exclusive) |last=Fernandez |first=Jay A. |work=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> Over a year later [[Len Wiseman]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Wiseman\">{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/len-wiseman-to-direct-total-tecall |title=Len Wiseman to Direct Total Recall |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |work=/Film |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> Paul Cameron is the film's cinematographer,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032244 |title=Revisionist History for 'Kennedys' crew |last=Caranicas |first=Peter |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> and [[Christian Wagner]] is the film's editor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/457389/Total-Recall-Remake-/credits |title=Total Recall (Remake) (2012) |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> The soundtrack is a collaboration of [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] and Welsh electronica group [[Hybrid (Welsh band)|Hybrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridsoundsystem.com/music-for-total-recall |title=Music for Total Recall \u00ab Hybrid |work=HybridSoundSystem.com |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> \n\nAlthough described in the press as a \"remake,\" star Jessica Biel claimed in her August 2, 2012 appearance on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' that the film is not a remake of the 1990 film, but an adaptation of the original short story by Philip K.

This version of the film also uses the names Quaid and Lori for the main character and his wife, like the 1990 film, whereas in the original short story they were Quail and Kirsten. The basic story also follows that of the original 1990 film, albeit with certain changes such as keeping the action on Earth rather than Mars.

It received praise for its action sequences and acting, but the lack of humor, emotional subtlety, and character development drew some criticism. \n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:Filmplot, a plot section should not exceed 700 words. Please do not add excessive details. --> \nAt the end of the 21st century, Earth is devastated by [[chemical warfare]]. Precious remaining habitable land is found in just two territories: the United Federation of Britain (UFB), located on the British Isles and northwestern Europe; and the Colony, covering Australia. Factory workers living in the Colony quickly commute to the UFB each day via \u201cThe Fall,\u201d a [[Gravity train|gravity elevator]] through the Earth's core which takes 17 minutes to traverse. A Resistance operating in the UFB, which the UFB views as a terrorist movement, seeks to improve living conditions in the Colony.\n\nColony citizen Douglas Quaid has been having dreams of being a secret agent, aided by an unnamed woman. Tired of his factory job building police robots with friend Harry, he visits Rekall, a company that implants artificial memories. Quaid chooses a fantasy as a secret agent. An emblem of Rekall is stamped onto his arm and, just as the fantasy is being loaded by technician McClane, they discover that Quaid already has real memories of being a spy. As McClane starts to question Quaid about the memories, a squad of UFB police burst in, kill the Rekall staff, and attempt to arrest Quaid. Quaid reacts instinctively, killing the entire squad. Upon returning home his wife Lori attempts to kill him, revealing that she is a UFB intelligence agent and they've only been \u201cmarried\u201d for six weeks, not seven years. After Quaid escapes, Charles Hammond, stating he is an old friend, contacts him and directs him to a safe-deposit box, where Quaid finds a message from himself with the address of an apartment.\n\nPursued by Lori, human and robot police, Quaid is rescued by Melina, the woman from his dreams. At the apartment, Quaid finds another recording, revealing that he is actually Carl Hauser, an agent working for UFB Chancellor Cohaagen to infiltrate the Resistance. Hauser defected, but was recaptured by the UFB and implanted with [[False memory|false memories]] to manipulate him. The recording reveals that Cohaagen will use robots to wipe out the Colony, replace the Colonists as laborers, and give the UFB more living space. Hauser has seen a \u201ckill code\u201d,  which can be recovered from his memory by Resistance leader Matthias, that will disable the robots. Melina reveals that she was Hauser's lover before he was recaptured, comparing their matching scars from a time they were shot while holding hands. The police arrive and Harry appears. He tries to convince Quaid that he is still in a Rekall-induced dream and that killing Melina is the only way out. Quaid is unsure, but notices a tear on Melina's cheek and shoots Harry. Lori pursues the pair, but they escape.\n\nQuaid and Melina find Matthias. While Matthias searches Quaid's memories, Lori and Cohaagen storm the Resistance base. Cohaagen reveals that Hauser was in fact still working for him<!--Note: In theatrical version, Cohaagen mentioned Hauser has been \"corrupted\", which suggested Hauser did in fact go rogue.--> and contributed to Quaid's memory alteration, dreaming up the kill code as a trap. Cohaagen kills Matthias, takes Melina prisoner, and leaves Hauser for pre-Quaid memory restoration. As the officers are about to inject Quaid, Hammond reveals himself and dies helping Quaid escape.\n\nCohaagen loads The Fall with his invasion army of robots. Quaid sneaks on board, setting timed explosives throughout the ship while searching for Melina. He frees her as The Fall arrives at the Colony. As they fight the soldiers and Cohaagen, Quaid's explosives detonate. Quaid and Melina jump off before the ship plummets back into the tunnel and explodes underground, killing Cohaagen and destroying his army and The Fall itself &ndash; the only way to reach the UFB.\n\nWaking up in an ambulance, Quaid is greeted by Melina. When he notices that she is missing their matching hand scar, he realizes that she is Lori using a holographic disguise; they fight and Lori is killed. Quaid finds the real Melina as news channels declare the independence of the Colony and an advertisement for Rekall plays on a billboard in the background.\n\n=== Alternative ending ===\nIn the extended director's cut, Quaid notices that the emblem mark he had gotten at Rekall prior to all that has happened is no longer visible on his arm, suggesting that he is still living a fantasy within the Rekall mainframe.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order and roles as displayed --->\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Douglas Quaid/Hauser, a factory worker suffering from strange violent dreams.<ref name=\"Collin\" />\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Lori, a UFB undercover agent posing as Quaid's wife.<ref name=\"Kate\" />\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Melina, a member of the Resistance and love interest.<ref name=\"Kate\" />\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Cohaagen, the corrupt and ruthless [[Chancellor]] of the United Federation of Britain.<ref name=\"Cranston\" />\n* [[Bokeem Woodbine]] as Harry, Quaid's workmate and best friend \u2013 in fact an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor him.\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Matthias, the leader of the Resistance.<ref name=\"Kuato\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/open-your-mind-to-bill-nighy-as-the-new-kuato-in-the-remake-of-total-recall |title=Open your mind to Bill Nighy as the new Kuato in the remake of Total Recall |work=Jablo.com |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[John Cho]] as McClane, a rep and tech at Rekall who offers Quaid the chance to experience an imagined adventure.<ref name=\"Cho\" />\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as Marek, a factory worker who refers Quaid to McClane at Rekall.\n* [[Dylan Smith (Canadian actor)|Dylan Smith]] (credited as Dylan Scott Smith) as Hammond\n\n==Production==\nOn June 2, 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Kurt Wimmer]] would write the script for the film.<ref name=\"VarietyJune2009\">{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451?refCatId=13 |title=Wimmer to write 'Total Recall' remake |last=Fleming |first=Mike |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128163539/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451?refCatId=13 |archive-date=January 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Mark Bomback]] was later brought on board,<ref name=\"Release\" /> and [[James Vanderbilt]] did an uncredited \"polish\" on the script.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-vanderbilt-returning-pen-spider-171190 |title=James Vanderbilt Returning to Pen 'Spider-Man' Sequel (Exclusive) |last=Fernandez |first=Jay A. |work=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> Over a year later [[Len Wiseman]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Wiseman\">{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/len-wiseman-to-direct-total-tecall |title=Len Wiseman to Direct Total Recall |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |work=/Film |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> Paul Cameron is the film's cinematographer,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032244 |title=Revisionist History for 'Kennedys' crew |last=Caranicas |first=Peter |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> and [[Christian Wagner]] is the film's editor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/457389/Total-Recall-Remake-/credits |title=Total Recall (Remake) (2012) |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> The soundtrack is a collaboration of [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] and Welsh electronica group [[Hybrid (Welsh band)|Hybrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridsoundsystem.com/music-for-total-recall |title=Music for Total Recall \u00ab Hybrid |work=HybridSoundSystem.com |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> \n\nAlthough described in the press as a \"remake,\" star Jessica Biel claimed in her August 2, 2012 appearance on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' that the film is not a remake of the 1990 film, but an adaptation of the original short story by Philip K.

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.\n\nSwedenborg, however, warned against seeking contact with spirits. In his work ''Apocalypse Explained,'' #1182.4, he wrote, \"Many persons believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. But those who believe this, and desire to do so, are not aware that it is associated with danger to their souls.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/apocalypsis-explicata/contents/11820 | title=Apocalypse Explained #1182 (Tansley (1952)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref> See also ''Heaven and Hell'' #249<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/de-coelo-et-de-inferno/contents/2490 | title=Heaven and Hell #249 (Dole (2000)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Swedenborg is often cited by Spiritists as a major precursor for their beliefs.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Fox sisters===\n{{Main|Fox sisters}}\n[[File:Fox sisters.jpeg|thumb|[[Fox sisters]], ''left to right:'' Margaret, Kate, Leah]]\n\nSisters Leah (1814\u201390), Margaretta (1836\u201393), and Catherine (1838\u201392) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism.

They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or [[psychography]], and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSkeptics suspected this was deception and fraud, and sister Margaretta eventually confessed to using her toe-joints to produce the sound. Although she later recanted this confession, she and her sister Catherine were widely considered discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called Spiritualism, which contributed significantly to Kardec's ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Talking boards===\n{{Main|Ouija}}\n{{See also|Table-turning}}\nAfter the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the \"Spiritual Telegraph\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Planchette]], the precursor of the pencil-less [[Ouija]] boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.<ref name=\"sargent\">[[Epes Sargent (poet)|Sargent, Epes]], [https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich ''Planchette or, The Despair of Science''], Roberts Brothers, Boston, 1869</ref>\n\n===Franz Mesmer===\n{{Main|Franz Mesmer}}\n[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Anton Mesmer]]]]\n\nFranz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 \u2013 March 5, 1815) discovered what he called ''magn\u00e9tisme animal'' ([[animal magnetism]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which became known as ''mesmerism''.

In contrast, they believe that mediums have these natural abilities highly developed, and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly, or through writing (known by Kardecists as [[psychography]] or [[automatic writing]]).<ref>(See The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec Chapters X to XIII)</ref>\n\n==Spiritist practice==\n{{Main|Spiritist practice}}\nKardec's works do not establish any rituals or formal practices.

Kardec's own introductory book on Spiritism, ''[[What is Spiritism?]]'', published only two years after ''[[The Spirits' Book]]'', includes a hypothetical discussion between him and three idealized critics, \"The Critic\", \"The Skeptic\", and \"The Priest\", summing up much of the criticism Spiritism has received. The broad areas of criticism relate to [[charlatan]]ism, [[pseudoscience]], [[Christian heresy|heresy]], [[witchcraft]], and [[Satanism]]. Until his death, Kardec continued to address these issues in various books and in his periodical, the ''Revue Spirite''.\n\nLater, a new source of criticism came from [[Occult]]ist movements such as the [[Theosophical Society]], a competing new religion,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even na\u00efve.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/corson/cors-lt1.htm |title= Letter to Prof. Hiram Corson |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Blavatsky |first= H.

His work was later extended by writers such as [[L\u00e9on Denis]], [[Gabriel Delanne]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Ernesto Bozzano]], [[Gustav Geley]], [[Chico Xavier]], [[Divaldo Pereira Franco]], Em\u00eddio Brasileiro, [[Alexandr Aksakov]], [[William Crookes]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Albert de Rochas]], and [[Amalia Domingo Soler]]. Kardec's research was influenced by the [[Fox sisters]] and the use of [[ouija|talking boards]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Interest in [[Mesmerism]] also contributed to early Spiritism.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Swedenborg===\n{{Main|Emanuel Swedenborg}}\n[[File:Emanuel Swedenborg, 1688-1772, \u00e4mbetsman (Per Krafft d.\u00e4.) - Nationalmuseum - 15710.tif|thumb|[[Emanuel Swedenborg]], 75, holding the manuscript of ''Apocalypsis Revelata'' (1766).]]\nEmanuel Swedenborg (January 29, 1688 \u2013 March 29, 1772) was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[scientist]], [[philosopher]], [[clairvoyance|seer]], and [[theologian]]. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.\n\nSwedenborg, however, warned against seeking contact with spirits. In his work ''Apocalypse Explained,'' #1182.4, he wrote, \"Many persons believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. But those who believe this, and desire to do so, are not aware that it is associated with danger to their souls.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/apocalypsis-explicata/contents/11820 | title=Apocalypse Explained #1182 (Tansley (1952)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref> See also ''Heaven and Hell'' #249<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/de-coelo-et-de-inferno/contents/2490 | title=Heaven and Hell #249 (Dole (2000)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Swedenborg is often cited by Spiritists as a major precursor for their beliefs.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Fox sisters===\n{{Main|Fox sisters}}\n[[File:Fox sisters.jpeg|thumb|[[Fox sisters]], ''left to right:'' Margaret, Kate, Leah]]\n\nSisters Leah (1814\u201390), Margaretta (1836\u201393), and Catherine (1838\u201392) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism. The daughters of John and Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family began to hear unexplained rapping sounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Kate and Maggie conducted channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or [[psychography]], and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSkeptics suspected this was deception and fraud, and sister Margaretta eventually confessed to using her toe-joints to produce the sound. Although she later recanted this confession, she and her sister Catherine were widely considered discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called Spiritualism, which contributed significantly to Kardec's ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Talking boards===\n{{Main|Ouija}}\n{{See also|Table-turning}}\nAfter the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the \"Spiritual Telegraph\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Planchette]], the precursor of the pencil-less [[Ouija]] boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.<ref name=\"sargent\">[[Epes Sargent (poet)|Sargent, Epes]], [https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich ''Planchette or, The Despair of Science''], Roberts Brothers, Boston, 1869</ref>\n\n===Franz Mesmer===\n{{Main|Franz Mesmer}}\n[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Anton Mesmer]]]]\n\nFranz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 \u2013 March 5, 1815) discovered what he called ''magn\u00e9tisme animal'' ([[animal magnetism]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which became known as ''mesmerism''. The evolution of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] (1795\u20131860) to develop [[hypnotism]] in 1841.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSpiritism incorporated various concepts from [[Mesmerism]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} among them [[faith healing]] and the energization of water to be used as a medicine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Difference from spiritualism==\nSpiritism differs from Spiritualism primarily in that it believes in reincarnation.

''The History of Spiritualism''. New York: G.H. Doran, Co</ref>\n\nIn ''[[What Is Spiritism?]]'', Kardec calls Spiritism a science dedicated to the relationship between incorporeal beings (spirits) and human beings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Thus, some Spiritists see themselves as not adhering to a religion, but to a philosophical doctrine with a scientific fulcrum and moral grounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAnother author in the Spiritualist movement, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] included a chapter<ref>[[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

In contrast, they believe that mediums have these natural abilities highly developed, and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly, or through writing (known by Kardecists as [[psychography]] or [[automatic writing]]).<ref>(See The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec Chapters X to XIII)</ref>\n\n==Spiritist practice==\n{{Main|Spiritist practice}}\nKardec's works do not establish any rituals or formal practices.

The broad areas of criticism relate to [[charlatan]]ism, [[pseudoscience]], [[Christian heresy|heresy]], [[witchcraft]], and [[Satanism]]. Until his death, Kardec continued to address these issues in various books and in his periodical, the ''Revue Spirite''.\n\nLater, a new source of criticism came from [[Occult]]ist movements such as the [[Theosophical Society]], a competing new religion,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even na\u00efve.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/corson/cors-lt1.htm |title= Letter to Prof. Hiram Corson |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Blavatsky |first= H.
