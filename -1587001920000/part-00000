Derfler. Jr.}}</ref>) is a [[computer server]] running [[list of BBS software|software]] that allows users to connect to the system using a [[terminal program]]. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as [[upload]]ing and [[download]]ing software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through public [[Internet forum|message boards]] and sometimes via direct [[synchronous conferencing|chatting]]. In the early 1980s, message networks such as [[FidoNet]] sprung up to provide services such as NetMail, which is similar to [[email]].\n\nMany BBSes also offer [[BBS door|online games]] in which users can compete with each other. BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide [[chat room]]s, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the [[World Wide Web]], [[social network service|social networks]], and other aspects of the [[Internet]]. Low-cost, high-performance [[modem]]s drove the use of [[online service]]s and BBSes through the early 1990s. ''[[InfoWorld]]'' estimated that there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services such as [[CompuServe]].\n\nThe introduction of inexpensive [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up internet service]] and the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic web browser]] offered ease of use and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, and led to a rapid crash in the market starting in 1994. Over the next year, many of the [[List of BBS software|leading BBS software providers]] went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] and tens of thousands of BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see [[PTT Bulletin Board System]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkingchinese.com/chinese-bbs-the-social-activity-that-never-grows-old\n |title=Thinking Chinese - Chinese BBS \u2013 The Social Activity that Never Grows Old|author=|date=\n |website=thinkingchinese.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Most surviving BBSes are accessible over [[Telnet]] and typically offer free email accounts, FTP services, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and all the [[Communications protocol|protocols]] commonly used on the Internet. Some offer access through packet switched networks or [[packet radio]] connections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nA precursor to the public bulletin board system was, started in August 1973 in [[Berkeley, California]]. Useful [[microcomputer]]s did not exist at that time, and modems were both expensive and slow. Community Memory therefore ran on a [[mainframe computer]] and was accessed through terminals located in several [[San Francisco Bay Area]] neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kip|date=November 1995|title=Convivial Cybernetic Devices|journal=The Analytical Engine|publisher=Computer History Association of California|volume=3|issue=1|issn=1071-6351|url=http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323072155/http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html|archivedate=2010-03-23}}</ref> The poor quality of the original modem connecting the terminals to the mainframe prompted a user to invent the [[Pennywhistle modem]], whose design was highly influential in the mid-1970s.\n\nCommunity Memory allowed the user to type messages into a [[computer terminal]] after inserting a coin, and offered a \"pure\" bulletin board experience with public messages only (no email or other features). It did offer the ability to tag messages with keywords, which the user could use in searches. The system acted primarily in the form of a buy and sell system with the tags taking the place of the more traditional [[Classified advertising|classifications]]. But users found ways to express themselves outside these bounds, and the system spontaneously created stories, poetry and other forms of communications. The system was expensive to operate, and when their host machine became unavailable and a new one could not be found, the system closed in January 1975.\n\nSimilar functionality was available to most mainframe users, which might be considered a sort of ultra-local BBS when used in this fashion. Commercial systems, expressly intended to offer these features to the public, became available in the late 1970s and formed the [[online service]] market that lasted into the 1990s. One particularly influential example was [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]], which had thousands of users by the late 1970s, many of whom used the messaging and [[chat room]] features of the system in the same way that would become common on BBSes.\n\n===The first BBSes===\n[[Image:Ward Christensen and the First BBS.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Ward Christensen holds an expansion card from the original CBBS S-100 host machine.]]\nEarly modems were generally very simple devices using [[acoustic coupler]]s to handle telephone operation. The user would first pick up the phone, dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups on the top of the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.\n\nWith the introduction of [[microcomputer]]s with expansion slots, like the [[S-100 bus]] machines and [[Apple II]], it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.\n\nThe first public [[dial-up]] BBS was developed by [[Ward Christensen]] and [[Randy Suess]]. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the [[Great Blizzard of 1978]], the two began preliminary work on the [[Computerized Bulletin Board System]], or [[CBBS]]. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in [[Chicago]] where it would be a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the [[cork board]] his local computer club used to post information like \"need a ride\". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978.<ref name=byte_christensen_suess>{{cite magazine |last1=Christensen |first1=Ward |last2=Suess |first2=Randy |title= Hobbyist Computerized Bulletin Board System|url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/byte%20nov%201978%20computerized%20BBS%20-%20ward%20christensen.pdf|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1978-11 |archive-date= June 4, 2009|access-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live |quote=The Computerized Hobbyist Bulletin Board System ... was conceived, designed, built, programmed, tested, and installed in a 30 day period (January 16, 1978 to February 16, 1978) by the two of us.  | magazine = Byte | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 150\u2013157 | publisher = Byte Publications | location = Peterborough, NH | date = November 1978 }}</ref><ref name=ward>[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/AAA/AAA/CBBS/memories.txt Collection of Memories of writing and running the first BBS by Ward Christensen (Circa 1992)], ''BBSDocumentary.com'', retrieved June 30, 2007</ref> CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Smartmodem===\n[[File:Hayes 300 Baud Smartmodem 02.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The 300 baud Smartmodem led to an initial wave of early BBS systems.]]\n\nA key innovation required for the popularization of the BBS was the [[Hayes Microcomputer Products#The Smartmodem|Smartmodem]] manufactured by [[Hayes Microcomputer Products]]. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, and could not be used with other useful platforms like [[video terminal]]s. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.\n\nHayes' solution to the problem was to use a small [[microcontroller]] to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as all the rest of the data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.\n\nThe introduction of the Smartmodem led to the first real wave of BBS systems. Limited in both speed and storage capacity, these systems were normally dedicated solely to messaging, both private email and public forums. File transfers were painfully slow at these speeds, and file libraries were typically limited to text files containing lists of other BBS systems. These systems attracted a particular type of user who used the BBS as a unique type of communications medium, and when these local systems were crowded from the market in the 1990s, their loss was lamented for many years.\n\n=== Higher speeds, commercialization ===\nSpeed improved with the introduction of 1200 [[Bits per second|bit/s]] modems in the [[Modem#Increasing speeds|early 1980s]], giving way to 2400 bit/s fairly rapidly. The improved performance led to a substantial increase in BBS popularity. Most of the information was displayed using ordinary [[ASCII]] text or [[ANSI art]], but a number of systems attempted character-based [[graphical user interface]]s which began to be practical at 2400 bit/s.\n\nThere was a lengthy delay before 9600&nbsp;bit/s models began to appear on the market. 9600&nbsp;bit/s was not even established as a strong standard before [[V.32bis]] at 14.4&nbsp;kbit/s took over in the early 1990s. This period also saw the rapid rise in capacity and a dramatic drop in the price of [[hard drive]]s. By the late 1980s, many BBS systems had significant file libraries, and this gave rise to leeching, users calling BBSes solely for their files. These users would tie up the modem for some time, leaving less time for other users, who got [[busy signal]]s. The resulting upheaval eliminated many of the pioneering message-centric systems.<ref>[http://www.oldgamemags.com/multi-format/non-gaming-magazines/chips-bits/ \"File Sponges, the BBS nightmare\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120141625/http://www.oldgamemags.com/multi-format/non-gaming-magazines/chips-bits/ |date=2015-01-20 }}, ''Chips 'n Bits''</ref>\n\nThis also gave rise to a new class of BBS systems, dedicated solely to file upload and downloads. These systems charged for access, typically a flat monthly fee, compared to the per-hour fees charged by ''[[Event Horizons BBS]]'' and most online services. A host of 3rd party services sprang up to support these systems, offering simple credit card [[merchant account]] gateways for the payment of monthly fees, and entire file libraries on [[compact disk]] that made initial setup very easy. Early 1990s editions of ''Boardwatch'' were filled with ads for single-click install solutions dedicated to these new [[sysops]]. While this gave the market a bad reputation, it also led to its greatest success. During the early 1990s, there were a number of mid-sized software companies dedicated to BBS software, and the number of BBSes in service reached its peak.\n\nTowards the early 1990s, the BBS industry became so popular that it spawned three monthly magazines, ''[[Boardwatch]]'', ''[[BBS Magazine]]'', and in Asia and Australia, ''[[Chips 'n Bits Magazine]]'' which devoted extensive coverage of the software and technology innovations and people behind them, and listings to US and worldwide BBSes.<ref name=ChipsnBits>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54469 Chips 'n' Bits : the Northern Territory Computer Users' newsletter], ''catalogue.nla.gov.au'', retrieved March 15, 2009</ref> In addition, in the US, a major monthly magazine, ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'', carried a list of BBSes along with a brief abstract of each of their offerings.\n\n===GUIs===\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was considerable experimentation with ways to improve the BBS experience from its [[command-line interface]] roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer command-line recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of [[autocomplete]] to make menu navigation simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.\n\nA number of systems also made forays into GUI-based interfaces, either using character graphics sent from the host, or using custom GUI-based terminal systems. The latter initially appeared, unsurprisingly, on the [[Macintosh]] platform, where [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]] became very popular. FirstClass offered a host of features that would be difficult or impossible under a terminal-based solution, including bi-directional information flow and non-blocking operation that allowed the user to exchange files in both directions while continuing to use the message system and chat, all in separate windows. [[Skypix]] featured on Amiga a complete [[markup language]]. It used a standardized set of icons to indicate mouse driven commands available online and to recognize different filetypes present on BBS storage media. It was capable to transmit data like images, audio files, and audio clips between users linked to same BBS or off-line if BBS was in the circuit of FidoNet organization.\nOn the PC, efforts were more oriented to extensions of the original terminal concept, with the GUI being described in the information on the host. One example was the [[Remote Imaging Protocol]], essentially a picture description system, which remained relatively obscure. Probably the ultimate development of this style of operation was the dynamic page implementation of the [[University of Southern California]] BBS (USCBBS) by Susan Biddlecomb, which predated the implementation of the [[HTML]] [[Dynamic web page]]. A complete Dynamic web page implementation was accomplished using [[The Bread Board System|TBBS]] with a [[TDBS]] add-on presenting a complete menu system individually customized for each user.\n\n===Rise of the Internet and decline of BBS===\nThe demand for complex ANSI and ASCII screens and larger file transfers taxed available [[channel capacity]], which in turn propelled demand for faster modems. 14.4 kbit/s modems were standard for a number of years while various companies attempted to introduce non-standard systems with higher performance, normally about 19.2 kbit/s. Another delay followed due to a long [[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations|V.34]] standards process before 28.8&nbsp;kbit/s was released, only to be quickly replaced by 33.6&nbsp;kbit/s, and then 56&nbsp;kbit/s.\n\nThese increasing speeds had the side effect of dramatically reducing the noticeable effects of channel efficiency. When modems were slow, considerable effort was put into developing the most efficient protocols and display systems possible. Running a general-purpose protocol like [[TCP/IP]] over a 1200 bit/s modem was a painful experience. With [[56 kbit/s modem]]s, however, the overhead was so greatly reduced as to be unnoticeable. Dial-up Internet service became widely available in 1994, and a must-have option for any general-use [[operating system]] by 1995.\n\nThese developments together resulted in the sudden obsolescence of bulletin board technology in 1995 and the collapse of its supporting market. Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's [[Internet service provider]] allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct point-to-point connection, so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection to be used to contact multiple services at the same time, say download files from an [[FTP]] library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the information on that system.\n\n=== Estimating numbers ===\nAccording to the [[FidoNet]] Nodelist, BBSes reached their peak usage around 1996, which was the same period that the [[World Wide Web]] and [[AOL]] became mainstream. BBSes rapidly declined in popularity thereafter, and were replaced by systems using the Internet for connectivity. Some of the larger commercial BBSes, such as MaxMegabyte and [[ExecPC BBS]], evolved into [[Internet service provider]]s.\n\nThe website ''[[textfiles.com]]'' serves as an archive that documents the history of the BBS. The [http://bbslist.textfiles.com/ historical BBS list] on ''textfiles.com'' contains over 105,000 BBSes that have existed over a span of 20 years in North America alone. The owner of ''textfiles.com'', [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]], also produced ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]'', a [[DVD]] film that chronicles the history of the BBS and features interviews with well-known people (mostly from the United States) from the heyday BBS era.\n\nAs of March 2019, most traditional BBS systems have migrated to the Internet using Telnet or SSH protocols.  Estimated numbers of active BBS systems at any given time are between 400 and 500, fewer than a dozen of these being of the traditional \"dial-up\" (modem) variety.\n\n== Software and hardware ==\n[[File:Amiga3000UX.jpg|thumb|Amiga 3000 running a two-line BBS]]\n\nUnlike modern websites and [[online services]] that are typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial [[data center]]s, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases, only one user could be on the system at a time. Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a [[LAN]] connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.\n\nThe first BBSes used homebrew software,{{efn|CBBS Chicago (which [[Ward Christensen]] programmed) was about 20,000 lines of 8080 assembler.}} quite often written or customized by the SysOps themselves, running on early [[S-100 bus]] [[microcomputer]] systems such as the [[Altair 8800]], [[IMSAI 8080]] and [[Cromemco]] under the [[CP/M]] operating system. Soon after, BBS software was being written for all of the major [[home computer]] systems of the late 1970s era \u2013 the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]] and [[TRS-80]] being some of the most popular.\n\nA few years later, in 1981, IBM introduced the first [[DOS]] based [[IBM personal computer|IBM PC]], and due to the overwhelming popularity of PCs and their [[IBM PC Compatible|clones]], DOS soon became the operating system on which the majority of BBS programs were run. [[RBBS-PC]], [[porting|ported]] over from the CP/M world, and ''Fido'' BBS, created by [[Tom Jennings]] (who later founded [[FidoNet]]) were the first notable DOS BBS programs. Many successful commercial BBS programs were developed for DOS, such as [[PCBoard]] BBS, [[RemoteAccess]] BBS, and [[Wildcat! BBS]]. Some popular [[freeware]] BBS programs for DOS included [[Telegard]] BBS and [[Renegade (BBS)|Renegade BBS]], which both had early origins from leaked [[WWIV]] BBS source code. There were several dozen other BBS programs developed over the DOS era, and many were released under the [[shareware]] concept, while some were released as [[freeware]] including iniquity.\n\nBBS systems on other systems remained popular, especially [[home computer]]s, largely because they catered to the audience of users running those machines. The ubiquitous [[Commodore 64]] (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were [[Blue Board (software)|Blue Board]], [[Ivory BBS]], [[Color64]] and [[C-Net DS2|CNet 64]]. In the early 1990s, a small number of BBSes were also running on the Commodore [[Amiga]]. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, [[Amiexpress]], C-Net, StormforceBBS, [[Infinity (software)|Infinity]] and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], then the 800XL, and eventually the [[Atari ST|1040ST]]. The earlier machines generally lacked [[hard drive]] capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.\n\nMS-DOS continued to be the most popular operating system for BBS use up until the mid-1990s, and in the early years, most multi-node BBSes were running under a DOS based multitasker such as [[DESQview]] or consisted of multiple computers connected via a [[LAN]]. In the late 1980s, a handful of BBS developers implemented multitasking communications routines inside their software, allowing multiple phone lines and users to connect to the same BBS computer. These included Galacticomm's [[MajorBBS]] (later WorldGroup), eSoft [[The Bread Board System]] (TBBS), and [[Falken]]. Other popular BBS's were [[Maximus (BBS)|Maximus]] and Opus, with some associated applications such as BinkleyTerm being based on characters from the [[Berkeley Breathed|Berkley Breathed]] cartoon strip of [[Bloom County]]. Though most BBS software had been written in [[BASIC]] or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (with some low-level routines written in [[assembly language]]), the [[C (language)|C]] language was starting to gain popularity.\n\nBy 1995, many of the DOS-based BBSes had begun switching to modern [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[OS/2]], [[Windows 95]], and [[Linux]]. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was [[Excalibur BBS]] with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led to one of the earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as [[Synchronet]], [[Mystic BBS]], EleBBS, [[Dave's own version of Citadel|DOC]] or [[Wildcat! BBS]], provide access using the [[Telnet]] protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a [[FOSSIL]]-to-Telnet redirector such as [[NetFoss]].\n\n== Presentation ==\n[[File:Neon2.png|thumb|Welcome screen of Neon#2 BBS (Tornado)]]\n\nBBSes were generally text-based, rather than [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple [[ASCII]] character set. However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII character set to take advantage of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these extended character sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native character set was known as [[ATASCII]], while most Commodore BBSes supported [[PETSCII]]. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service [[Quantum Link]].{{efn|Quantum Link and parts of [[AppleLink]] went on to become [[America Online]].}}\n\nThe use of these custom character sets was generally incompatible between manufacturers. Unless a caller was using terminal emulation software written for, and running on, the same type of system as the BBS, the session would simply fall back to simple ASCII output. For example, a Commodore 64 user calling an Atari BBS would use ASCII rather than the machine's native character set. As time progressed, most terminal programs began using the [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] standard, but could use their native character set if it was available.\n\nCOCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was released in 1988 and only supported a GUI (no text interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made it stand out from the text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the [[PLATO system]], and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called [[Remote Imaging Protocol]] (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called [[NAPLPS]] was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy service]], it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the [[Apple Macintosh]] platform, including [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]], but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.\n\nIn the UK, the [[BBC Micro]] based OBBS software, available from [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]] for use with their modems, optionally allowed for color and graphics using the [[Teletext]] based graphics mode available on that platform. Other systems used the [[Viewdata]] protocols made popular in the UK by [[British Telecom]]'s [[Prestel]] service, and the on-line magazine [[Micronet800|Micronet 800]] whom were busy giving away modems with their subscriptions.\n\nThe most popular form of online graphics was [[ANSI art]], which combined the [[Extended ASCII|IBM Extended ASCII]] character set's blocks and symbols with [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] [[escape sequence]]s to allow changing colors on demand, provide cursor control and screen formatting, and even basic musical tones. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, most BBSes used ANSI to make elaborate welcome screens, and colorized menus, and thus, ANSI support was a sought-after feature in terminal client programs. The development of ANSI art became so popular that it spawned an entire BBS \"[[artscene]]\" [[subculture]] devoted to it.\n[[File:Koala Country BBS Login Screen.jpg|400px|thumb|BBS ANSI Login Screen example]]\n\nThe [[Amiga]] ''Skyline BBS'' software was the first in 1987 featuring a script [[markup language]] communication protocol called [[Skypix]] which was capable of giving the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.<ref name=\"Skyline\">{{cite web | title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher = [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author = Scott Lee | accessdate = 2017-04-06 }}</ref>\n\nToday, most BBS software that is still actively supported, such as Worldgroup, [[Wildcat! BBS]] and [[Citadel/UX]], is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or [[DOSBox]] (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem [[terminal emulator|terminal emulation]] software, like [[Telix]], [[Terminate (software)|Terminate]], [[Qmodem]] and [[Procomm Plus]]. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and [[Synchronet#SyncTerm|SyncTerm]] include native telnet support.\n\n== Content and access ==\nSince most early BBSes were run by computer hobbyists, they were typically technical in topic, with user communities revolving around hardware and software discussions.\n\nAs the BBS phenomenon grew, so did the popularity of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, [[matchmaker.com|dating]], and [[alternative lifestyle]]s. Many SysOps also adopted a [[Theme (computing)|theme]] in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) to reflect that theme. Common themes were based on [[fantasy]], or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a [[sanatorium]], wizard's castle, or on a [[pirate ship]].\n\nIn the early days, the file download library consisted of files that the SysOps obtained themselves from other BBSes and friends. Many BBSes inspected every file uploaded to their public file download library to ensure that the material did not violate copyright law. As time went on, [[shareware]] CD-ROMs were sold with up to thousands of files on each [[CD-ROM]]. Small BBSes copied each file individually to their hard drive. Some systems used a CD-ROM drive to make the files available. Advanced BBSes used Multiple CD-ROM disc changer units that switched 6 CD-ROM disks on demand for the caller(s). Large systems used all 26 DOS drive letters with multi-disk changers housing tens of thousands of copyright-free shareware or freeware files available to all callers. These BBSes were generally more family friendly, avoiding the seedier side of BBSes. Access to these systems varied from single to multiple modem lines with some requiring little or no confirmed registration.\n\nSome BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were exclusively used for distributing [[copyright infringement of software|cracked software]], [[phreaking]], and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to upload and download files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt to prove that they were not a law enforcement officer or a ''[[lamer]].'' The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the [[slang]] known today as [[leet]]speak.\n\nAnother common type of board was the ''support BBS'' run by a manufacturer of computer products or software. These boards were dedicated to supporting users of the company's products with question and answer forums, news and updates, and downloads. Most of them were not a free call. Today, these services have moved to the web.\n\nSome general purpose Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that were given to those who paid extra money, uploaded useful files or knew the SysOp personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something unique to offer their users, such as large file libraries, [[warez]], [[pornography]], [[chat room]]s or [[Internet]] access.\n\nPay BBSes such as The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]] and Echo NYC (now Internet forums rather than dial-up), [[ExecPC BBS|ExecPC]], PsudNetwork and [[MindVox]] (which folded in 1996) were admired for their tight-knit communities and quality discussion forums. However, many free BBSes also maintained close knit communities, and some even had annual or bi-annual events where users would travel great distances to meet face-to-face with their on-line friends. These events were especially popular with BBSes that offered [[chat room]]s.\n\nSome of the BBSes that provided access to illegal content faced opposition. On July 12, 1985, in conjunction with a [[credit card fraud]] investigation, the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]] Sheriff's department raided and seized The Private Sector BBS, which was the official BBS for [[grey hat]] hacker quarterly [[2600 Magazine]] at the time.<ref name=Psector>[http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/blog/this-day-in-geek-history-july-12 This Day in Geek History: July12], ''thegreatgeekmanual.com'', retrieved March 26, 2009</ref> The notorious [[Rusty n Edie's BBS]], in [[Boardman, Ohio]], was raided by the FBI in January 1993 for trading unlicensed software, and later sued by [[Playboy]] for copyright infringement in November 1997. In [[Flint, Michigan]], a 21-year-old man was charged with distributing [[child pornography]] through his BBS in March 1996.<ref name=\"flintj\">{{cite news|title=Man Says Kiddie Porno Made Computer Site Popular|newspaper=[[The Flint Journal]]|date=1996-03-20|author=Doran, Tim}}</ref>\n\n==Networks==\nMost early BBSes operated as individual systems. Information contained on that BBS never left the system, and users would only interact with the information and user community on that BBS alone. However, as BBSes became more widespread, there evolved a desire to connect systems together to share messages and files with distant systems and users. The largest such network was [[FidoNet]].\n\nAs is it was prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a [[store and forward]] network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup [[Xmodem]] session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.\n\nFidoNet was platform-independent and would work with any BBS that was written to use it. BBSes that did not have integrated FidoNet capability could usually add it using an external FidoNet [[front end processor (program)|front-end]] mailer such as SEAdog, [[FrontDoor]], BinkleyTerm, InterMail or D'Bridge, and a mail processor such as [[FastEcho]] or [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]]. The front-end mailer would conduct the periodic FidoNet transfers, while the mail processor would usually run just before and just after the mailer ran. This program would scan for and pack up new outgoing messages, and then unpack, sort and \"toss\" the incoming messages into a BBS user's local email box or into the BBS's local message bases reserved for Echomail. As such, these mail processors were commonly called \"scanner/tosser/packers.\"\n\nMany other BBS networks followed the example of FidoNet, using the same standards and the same software. These were called FidoNet Technology Networks (FTNs). They were usually smaller and targeted at selected audiences. Some networks used [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] doors, and others such as [[RelayNet]] (RIME) and [[WWIVnet]] used non-Fido software and standards.\n\nBefore commercial Internet access became common, these [[computer network|networks]] of BBSes provided regional and international [[e-mail]] and message bases. Some even provided [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateways]], such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the [[Internet]] via [[UUCP]], and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to [[Usenet]]. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search [[Gopher (protocol)|gopherspace]], and interact with distant [[Computer program|programs]], all using plain text e-mail.\n\nAs the volume of FidoNet Mail increased and newsgroups from the early days of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a reasonable fee. By connecting a small dish & receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new outgoing messages via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums.\n\nFidoNet is still in use today, though in a much smaller form, and many Echomail groups are still shared with Usenet via FidoNet to Usenet gateways. Widespread abuse of Usenet with [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[pornography]] has led to many of these FidoNet gateways to cease operation completely.\n\n==Shareware and freeware==\n{{Main|Shareware}}\nMuch of the [[shareware]] movement was started via user distribution of software through BBSes. A notable example was [[Phil Katz]]'s PKARC (and later [[PKZIP]], using the same \".zip\" [[algorithm]] that [[WinZip]] and other popular archivers now use); also other concepts of software distribution like [[freeware]], [[postcardware]] like [[JPEGview]] and [[donationware]] like [[Red Ryder (software)|Red Ryder]] for the Macintosh first appeared on BBS sites. [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] from [[id Software]] and nearly all [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] games were distributed as shareware (Apogee is, in fact, credited for adding an order form to a shareware demo).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Internet has largely erased the distinction of shareware \u2013 most users now download the software directly from the developer's website rather than receiving it from another BBS user 'sharing' it. Today shareware is commonly used to mean electronically distributed software from a small developer.\n\nMany commercial BBS software companies that continue to support their old BBS software products switched to the shareware model or made it entirely free. Some companies were able to make the move to the Internet and provide commercial products with BBS capabilities.\n\n==Features==\nA classic BBS had:\n* A [[computer]]\n* One or more [[modem]]s\n* One or more phone lines, with more allowing for increased concurrent users\n* A [[List of BBS software|BBS software package]]\n* A [[sysop]] \u2013 system operator\n* A user community\n\nThe BBS software usually provides:\n* Menu Systems\n* One or more [[Message board|message base]]s\n* Uploading and downloading of message packets in [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] format using [[XMODEM]], [[YMODEM]] or [[ZMODEM]]\n* File areas\n* SysOp side, live viewing of all caller activity\n* Voting \u2013 opinion booths\n* Statistics on message posters, top uploaders / downloaders\n* [[Online game]]s (usually single [[Player (game)|player]] or only a single active player at a given time)\n* A [[BBS door|doorway]] to third-party online games\n* Usage auditing capabilities\n* Multi-user chat (only possible on multi-line BBSes)\n* Internet email (more common in later Internet-connected BBSes)\n* Networked message boards\n* Most modern BBSes allow [[telnet]] access over the Internet using a telnet server and a virtual [[FOSSIL]] driver.\n* A \"yell for SysOp\" page caller side menu item that sounded an audible alarm to the SysOp.

Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as [[upload]]ing and [[download]]ing software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through public [[Internet forum|message boards]] and sometimes via direct [[synchronous conferencing|chatting]]. In the early 1980s, message networks such as [[FidoNet]] sprung up to provide services such as NetMail, which is similar to [[email]].\n\nMany BBSes also offer [[BBS door|online games]] in which users can compete with each other. BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide [[chat room]]s, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the [[World Wide Web]], [[social network service|social networks]], and other aspects of the [[Internet]]. Low-cost, high-performance [[modem]]s drove the use of [[online service]]s and BBSes through the early 1990s. ''[[InfoWorld]]'' estimated that there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services such as [[CompuServe]].\n\nThe introduction of inexpensive [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up internet service]] and the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic web browser]] offered ease of use and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, and led to a rapid crash in the market starting in 1994. Over the next year, many of the [[List of BBS software|leading BBS software providers]] went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] and tens of thousands of BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see [[PTT Bulletin Board System]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkingchinese.com/chinese-bbs-the-social-activity-that-never-grows-old\n |title=Thinking Chinese - Chinese BBS \u2013 The Social Activity that Never Grows Old|author=|date=\n |website=thinkingchinese.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Most surviving BBSes are accessible over [[Telnet]] and typically offer free email accounts, FTP services, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and all the [[Communications protocol|protocols]] commonly used on the Internet. Some offer access through packet switched networks or [[packet radio]] connections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nA precursor to the public bulletin board system was [[Community Memory]], started in August 1973 in [[Berkeley, California]]. Useful [[microcomputer]]s did not exist at that time, and modems were both expensive and slow. Community Memory therefore ran on a [[mainframe computer]] and was accessed through terminals located in several [[San Francisco Bay Area]] neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kip|date=November 1995|title=Convivial Cybernetic Devices|journal=The Analytical Engine|publisher=Computer History Association of California|volume=3|issue=1|issn=1071-6351|url=http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323072155/http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html|archivedate=2010-03-23}}</ref> The poor quality of the original modem connecting the terminals to the mainframe prompted a user to invent the [[Pennywhistle modem]], whose design was highly influential in the mid-1970s.\n\nCommunity Memory allowed the user to type messages into a [[computer terminal]] after inserting a coin, and offered a \"pure\" bulletin board experience with public messages only (no email or other features). It did offer the ability to tag messages with keywords, which the user could use in searches. The system acted primarily in the form of a buy and sell system with the tags taking the place of the more traditional [[Classified advertising|classifications]]. But users found ways to express themselves outside these bounds, and the system spontaneously created stories, poetry and other forms of communications. The system was expensive to operate, and when their host machine became unavailable and a new one could not be found, the system closed in January 1975.\n\nSimilar functionality was available to most mainframe users, which might be considered a sort of ultra-local BBS when used in this fashion. Commercial systems, expressly intended to offer these features to the public, became available in the late 1970s and formed the [[online service]] market that lasted into the 1990s. One particularly influential example was [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]], which had thousands of users by the late 1970s, many of whom used the messaging and [[chat room]] features of the system in the same way that would become common on BBSes.\n\n===The first BBSes===\n[[Image:Ward Christensen and the First BBS.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Ward Christensen holds an expansion card from the original CBBS S-100 host machine.]]\nEarly modems were generally very simple devices using [[acoustic coupler]]s to handle telephone operation. The user would first pick up the phone, dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups on the top of the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.\n\nWith the introduction of [[microcomputer]]s with expansion slots, like the [[S-100 bus]] machines and [[Apple II]], it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.\n\nThe first public [[dial-up]] BBS was developed by [[Ward Christensen]] and [[Randy Suess]]. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the [[Great Blizzard of 1978]], the two began preliminary work on the [[Computerized Bulletin Board System]], or [[CBBS]]. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in [[Chicago]] where it would be a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the [[cork board]] his local computer club used to post information like \"need a ride\". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978.<ref name=byte_christensen_suess>{{cite magazine |last1=Christensen |first1=Ward |last2=Suess |first2=Randy |title= Hobbyist Computerized Bulletin Board System|url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/byte%20nov%201978%20computerized%20BBS%20-%20ward%20christensen.pdf|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1978-11 |archive-date= June 4, 2009|access-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live |quote=The Computerized Hobbyist Bulletin Board System ... was conceived, designed, built, programmed, tested, and installed in a 30 day period (January 16, 1978 to February 16, 1978) by the two of us.  | magazine = Byte | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 150\u2013157 | publisher = Byte Publications | location = Peterborough, NH | date = November 1978 }}</ref><ref name=ward>[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/AAA/AAA/CBBS/memories.txt Collection of Memories of writing and running the first BBS by Ward Christensen (Circa 1992)], ''BBSDocumentary.com'', retrieved June 30, 2007</ref> CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Smartmodem===\n[[File:Hayes 300 Baud Smartmodem 02.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The 300 baud Smartmodem led to an initial wave of early BBS systems.]]\n\nA key innovation required for the popularization of the BBS was the [[Hayes Microcomputer Products#The Smartmodem|Smartmodem]] manufactured by [[Hayes Microcomputer Products]]. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, and could not be used with other useful platforms like [[video terminal]]s. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.\n\nHayes' solution to the problem was to use a small [[microcontroller]] to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as all the rest of the data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.\n\nThe introduction of the Smartmodem led to the first real wave of BBS systems. Limited in both speed and storage capacity, these systems were normally dedicated solely to messaging, both private email and public forums. File transfers were painfully slow at these speeds, and file libraries were typically limited to text files containing lists of other BBS systems. These systems attracted a particular type of user who used the BBS as a unique type of communications medium, and when these local systems were crowded from the market in the 1990s, their loss was lamented for many years.\n\n=== Higher speeds, commercialization ===\nSpeed improved with the introduction of 1200 [[Bits per second|bit/s]] modems in the [[Modem#Increasing speeds|early 1980s]], giving way to 2400 bit/s fairly rapidly. The improved performance led to a substantial increase in BBS popularity. Most of the information was displayed using ordinary [[ASCII]] text or [[ANSI art]], but a number of systems attempted character-based [[graphical user interface]]s which began to be practical at 2400 bit/s.\n\nThere was a lengthy delay before 9600&nbsp;bit/s models began to appear on the market. 9600&nbsp;bit/s was not even established as a strong standard before [[V.32bis]] at 14.4&nbsp;kbit/s took over in the early 1990s. This period also saw the rapid rise in capacity and a dramatic drop in the price of [[hard drive]]s. By the late 1980s, many BBS systems had significant file libraries, and this gave rise to leeching, users calling BBSes solely for their files. These users would tie up the modem for some time, leaving less time for other users, who got [[busy signal]]s. The resulting upheaval eliminated many of the pioneering message-centric systems.<ref>[http://www.oldgamemags.com/multi-format/non-gaming-magazines/chips-bits/ \"File Sponges, the BBS nightmare\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120141625/http://www.oldgamemags.com/multi-format/non-gaming-magazines/chips-bits/ |date=2015-01-20 }}, ''Chips 'n Bits''</ref>\n\nThis also gave rise to a new class of BBS systems, dedicated solely to file upload and downloads. These systems charged for access, typically a flat monthly fee, compared to the per-hour fees charged by ''[[Event Horizons BBS]]'' and most online services. A host of 3rd party services sprang up to support these systems, offering simple credit card [[merchant account]] gateways for the payment of monthly fees, and entire file libraries on [[compact disk]] that made initial setup very easy. Early 1990s editions of ''Boardwatch'' were filled with ads for single-click install solutions dedicated to these new [[sysops]]. While this gave the market a bad reputation, it also led to its greatest success. During the early 1990s, there were a number of mid-sized software companies dedicated to BBS software, and the number of BBSes in service reached its peak.\n\nTowards the early 1990s, the BBS industry became so popular that it spawned three monthly magazines, ''[[Boardwatch]]'', ''[[BBS Magazine]]'', and in Asia and Australia, ''[[Chips 'n Bits Magazine]]'' which devoted extensive coverage of the software and technology innovations and people behind them, and listings to US and worldwide BBSes.<ref name=ChipsnBits>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54469 Chips 'n' Bits : the Northern Territory Computer Users' newsletter], ''catalogue.nla.gov.au'', retrieved March 15, 2009</ref> In addition, in the US, a major monthly magazine, ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'', carried a list of BBSes along with a brief abstract of each of their offerings.\n\n===GUIs===\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was considerable experimentation with ways to improve the BBS experience from its [[command-line interface]] roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer command-line recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of [[autocomplete]] to make menu navigation simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.\n\nA number of systems also made forays into GUI-based interfaces, either using character graphics sent from the host, or using custom GUI-based terminal systems. The latter initially appeared, unsurprisingly, on the [[Macintosh]] platform, where [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]] became very popular. FirstClass offered a host of features that would be difficult or impossible under a terminal-based solution, including bi-directional information flow and non-blocking operation that allowed the user to exchange files in both directions while continuing to use the message system and chat, all in separate windows. [[Skypix]] featured on Amiga a complete [[markup language]]. It used a standardized set of icons to indicate mouse driven commands available online and to recognize different filetypes present on BBS storage media. It was capable to transmit data like images, audio files, and audio clips between users linked to same BBS or off-line if BBS was in the circuit of FidoNet organization.\nOn the PC, efforts were more oriented to extensions of the original terminal concept, with the GUI being described in the information on the host. One example was the [[Remote Imaging Protocol]], essentially a picture description system, which remained relatively obscure. Probably the ultimate development of this style of operation was the dynamic page implementation of the [[University of Southern California]] BBS (USCBBS) by Susan Biddlecomb, which predated the implementation of the [[HTML]] [[Dynamic web page]]. A complete Dynamic web page implementation was accomplished using [[The Bread Board System|TBBS]] with a [[TDBS]] add-on presenting a complete menu system individually customized for each user.\n\n===Rise of the Internet and decline of BBS===\nThe demand for complex ANSI and ASCII screens and larger file transfers taxed available [[channel capacity]], which in turn propelled demand for faster modems. 14.4 kbit/s modems were standard for a number of years while various companies attempted to introduce non-standard systems with higher performance, normally about 19.2 kbit/s. Another delay followed due to a long [[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations|V.34]] standards process before 28.8&nbsp;kbit/s was released, only to be quickly replaced by 33.6&nbsp;kbit/s, and then 56&nbsp;kbit/s.\n\nThese increasing speeds had the side effect of dramatically reducing the noticeable effects of channel efficiency. When modems were slow, considerable effort was put into developing the most efficient protocols and display systems possible. Running a general-purpose protocol like [[TCP/IP]] over a 1200 bit/s modem was a painful experience. With [[56 kbit/s modem]]s, however, the overhead was so greatly reduced as to be unnoticeable. Dial-up Internet service became widely available in 1994, and a must-have option for any general-use [[operating system]] by 1995.\n\nThese developments together resulted in the sudden obsolescence of bulletin board technology in 1995 and the collapse of its supporting market. Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's [[Internet service provider]] allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct point-to-point connection, so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection to be used to contact multiple services at the same time, say download files from an [[FTP]] library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the information on that system.\n\n=== Estimating numbers ===\nAccording to the [[FidoNet]] Nodelist, BBSes reached their peak usage around 1996, which was the same period that the [[World Wide Web]] and [[AOL]] became mainstream. BBSes rapidly declined in popularity thereafter, and were replaced by systems using the Internet for connectivity. Some of the larger commercial BBSes, such as MaxMegabyte and [[ExecPC BBS]], evolved into [[Internet service provider]]s.\n\nThe website ''[[textfiles.com]]'' serves as an archive that documents the history of the BBS. The [http://bbslist.textfiles.com/ historical BBS list] on ''textfiles.com'' contains over 105,000 BBSes that have existed over a span of 20 years in North America alone. The owner of ''textfiles.com'', [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]], also produced ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]'', a [[DVD]] film that chronicles the history of the BBS and features interviews with well-known people (mostly from the United States) from the heyday BBS era.\n\nAs of March 2019, most traditional BBS systems have migrated to the Internet using Telnet or SSH protocols.  Estimated numbers of active BBS systems at any given time are between 400 and 500, fewer than a dozen of these being of the traditional \"dial-up\" (modem) variety.\n\n== Software and hardware ==\n[[File:Amiga3000UX.jpg|thumb|Amiga 3000 running a two-line BBS]]\n\nUnlike modern websites and [[online services]] that are typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial [[data center]]s, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases, only one user could be on the system at a time. Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a [[LAN]] connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.\n\nThe first BBSes used homebrew software,{{efn|CBBS Chicago (which [[Ward Christensen]] programmed) was about 20,000 lines of 8080 assembler.}} quite often written or customized by the SysOps themselves, running on early [[S-100 bus]] [[microcomputer]] systems such as the [[Altair 8800]], [[IMSAI 8080]] and [[Cromemco]] under the [[CP/M]] operating system. Soon after, BBS software was being written for all of the major [[home computer]] systems of the late 1970s era \u2013 the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]] and [[TRS-80]] being some of the most popular.\n\nA few years later, in 1981, IBM introduced the first [[DOS]] based [[IBM personal computer|IBM PC]], and due to the overwhelming popularity of PCs and their [[IBM PC Compatible|clones]], DOS soon became the operating system on which the majority of BBS programs were run. [[RBBS-PC]], [[porting|ported]] over from the CP/M world, and ''Fido'' BBS, created by [[Tom Jennings]] (who later founded [[FidoNet]]) were the first notable DOS BBS programs. Many successful commercial BBS programs were developed for DOS, such as [[PCBoard]] BBS, [[RemoteAccess]] BBS, and [[Wildcat! BBS]]. Some popular [[freeware]] BBS programs for DOS included [[Telegard]] BBS and [[Renegade (BBS)|Renegade BBS]], which both had early origins from leaked [[WWIV]] BBS source code. There were several dozen other BBS programs developed over the DOS era, and many were released under the [[shareware]] concept, while some were released as [[freeware]] including iniquity.\n\nBBS systems on other systems remained popular, especially [[home computer]]s, largely because they catered to the audience of users running those machines. The ubiquitous [[Commodore 64]] (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were [[Blue Board (software)|Blue Board]], [[Ivory BBS]], [[Color64]] and [[C-Net DS2|CNet 64]]. In the early 1990s, a small number of BBSes were also running on the Commodore [[Amiga]]. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, [[Amiexpress]], C-Net, StormforceBBS, [[Infinity (software)|Infinity]] and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], then the 800XL, and eventually the [[Atari ST|1040ST]]. The earlier machines generally lacked [[hard drive]] capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.\n\nMS-DOS continued to be the most popular operating system for BBS use up until the mid-1990s, and in the early years, most multi-node BBSes were running under a DOS based multitasker such as [[DESQview]] or consisted of multiple computers connected via a [[LAN]]. In the late 1980s, a handful of BBS developers implemented multitasking communications routines inside their software, allowing multiple phone lines and users to connect to the same BBS computer. These included Galacticomm's [[MajorBBS]] (later WorldGroup), eSoft [[The Bread Board System]] (TBBS), and [[Falken]]. Other popular BBS's were [[Maximus (BBS)|Maximus]] and Opus, with some associated applications such as BinkleyTerm being based on characters from the [[Berkeley Breathed|Berkley Breathed]] cartoon strip of [[Bloom County]]. Though most BBS software had been written in [[BASIC]] or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (with some low-level routines written in [[assembly language]]), the [[C (language)|C]] language was starting to gain popularity.\n\nBy 1995, many of the DOS-based BBSes had begun switching to modern [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[OS/2]], [[Windows 95]], and [[Linux]]. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was [[Excalibur BBS]] with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led to one of the earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as [[Synchronet]], [[Mystic BBS]], EleBBS, [[Dave's own version of Citadel|DOC]] or [[Wildcat! BBS]], provide access using the [[Telnet]] protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a [[FOSSIL]]-to-Telnet redirector such as [[NetFoss]].\n\n== Presentation ==\n[[File:Neon2.png|thumb|Welcome screen of Neon#2 BBS (Tornado)]]\n\nBBSes were generally text-based, rather than [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple [[ASCII]] character set. However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII character set to take advantage of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these extended character sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native character set was known as [[ATASCII]], while most Commodore BBSes supported [[PETSCII]]. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service [[Quantum Link]].{{efn|Quantum Link and parts of [[AppleLink]] went on to become [[America Online]].}}\n\nThe use of these custom character sets was generally incompatible between manufacturers. Unless a caller was using terminal emulation software written for, and running on, the same type of system as the BBS, the session would simply fall back to simple ASCII output. For example, a Commodore 64 user calling an Atari BBS would use ASCII rather than the machine's native character set. As time progressed, most terminal programs began using the [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] standard, but could use their native character set if it was available.\n\nCOCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was released in 1988 and only supported a GUI (no text interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made it stand out from the text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the [[PLATO system]], and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called [[Remote Imaging Protocol]] (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called [[NAPLPS]] was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy service]], it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the [[Apple Macintosh]] platform, including [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]], but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.\n\nIn the UK, the [[BBC Micro]] based OBBS software, available from [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]] for use with their modems, optionally allowed for color and graphics using the [[Teletext]] based graphics mode available on that platform. Other systems used the [[Viewdata]] protocols made popular in the UK by [[British Telecom]]'s [[Prestel]] service, and the on-line magazine [[Micronet800|Micronet 800]] whom were busy giving away modems with their subscriptions.\n\nThe most popular form of online graphics was [[ANSI art]], which combined the [[Extended ASCII|IBM Extended ASCII]] character set's blocks and symbols with [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] [[escape sequence]]s to allow changing colors on demand, provide cursor control and screen formatting, and even basic musical tones. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, most BBSes used ANSI to make elaborate welcome screens, and colorized menus, and thus, ANSI support was a sought-after feature in terminal client programs. The development of ANSI art became so popular that it spawned an entire BBS \"[[artscene]]\" [[subculture]] devoted to it.\n[[File:Koala Country BBS Login Screen.jpg|400px|thumb|BBS ANSI Login Screen example]]\n\nThe [[Amiga]] ''Skyline BBS'' software was the first in 1987 featuring a script [[markup language]] communication protocol called [[Skypix]] which was capable of giving the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.<ref name=\"Skyline\">{{cite web | title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher = [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author = Scott Lee | accessdate = 2017-04-06 }}</ref>\n\nToday, most BBS software that is still actively supported, such as Worldgroup, [[Wildcat! BBS]] and [[Citadel/UX]], is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or [[DOSBox]] (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem [[terminal emulator|terminal emulation]] software, like [[Telix]], [[Terminate (software)|Terminate]], [[Qmodem]] and [[Procomm Plus]]. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and [[Synchronet#SyncTerm|SyncTerm]] include native telnet support.\n\n== Content and access ==\nSince most early BBSes were run by computer hobbyists, they were typically technical in topic, with user communities revolving around hardware and software discussions.\n\nAs the BBS phenomenon grew, so did the popularity of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, [[matchmaker.com|dating]], and [[alternative lifestyle]]s. Many SysOps also adopted a [[Theme (computing)|theme]] in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) to reflect that theme. Common themes were based on [[fantasy]], or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a [[sanatorium]], wizard's castle, or on a [[pirate ship]].\n\nIn the early days, the file download library consisted of files that the SysOps obtained themselves from other BBSes and friends. Many BBSes inspected every file uploaded to their public file download library to ensure that the material did not violate copyright law. As time went on, [[shareware]] CD-ROMs were sold with up to thousands of files on each [[CD-ROM]]. Small BBSes copied each file individually to their hard drive. Some systems used a CD-ROM drive to make the files available. Advanced BBSes used Multiple CD-ROM disc changer units that switched 6 CD-ROM disks on demand for the caller(s). Large systems used all 26 DOS drive letters with multi-disk changers housing tens of thousands of copyright-free shareware or freeware files available to all callers. These BBSes were generally more family friendly, avoiding the seedier side of BBSes. Access to these systems varied from single to multiple modem lines with some requiring little or no confirmed registration.\n\nSome BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were exclusively used for distributing [[copyright infringement of software|cracked software]], [[phreaking]], and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to upload and download files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt to prove that they were not a law enforcement officer or a ''[[lamer]].'' The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the [[slang]] known today as [[leet]]speak.\n\nAnother common type of board was the ''support BBS'' run by a manufacturer of computer products or software. These boards were dedicated to supporting users of the company's products with question and answer forums, news and updates, and downloads. Most of them were not a free call. Today, these services have moved to the web.\n\nSome general purpose Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that were given to those who paid extra money, uploaded useful files or knew the SysOp personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something unique to offer their users, such as large file libraries, [[warez]], [[pornography]], [[chat room]]s or [[Internet]] access.\n\nPay BBSes such as The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]] and Echo NYC (now Internet forums rather than dial-up), [[ExecPC BBS|ExecPC]], PsudNetwork and [[MindVox]] (which folded in 1996) were admired for their tight-knit communities and quality discussion forums. However, many free BBSes also maintained close knit communities, and some even had annual or bi-annual events where users would travel great distances to meet face-to-face with their on-line friends. These events were especially popular with BBSes that offered [[chat room]]s.\n\nSome of the BBSes that provided access to illegal content faced opposition. On July 12, 1985, in conjunction with a [[credit card fraud]] investigation, the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]] Sheriff's department raided and seized The Private Sector BBS, which was the official BBS for [[grey hat]] hacker quarterly [[2600 Magazine]] at the time.<ref name=Psector>[http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/blog/this-day-in-geek-history-july-12 This Day in Geek History: July12], ''thegreatgeekmanual.com'', retrieved March 26, 2009</ref> The notorious [[Rusty n Edie's BBS]], in [[Boardman, Ohio]], was raided by the FBI in January 1993 for trading unlicensed software, and later sued by [[Playboy]] for copyright infringement in November 1997. In [[Flint, Michigan]], a 21-year-old man was charged with distributing [[child pornography]] through his BBS in March 1996.<ref name=\"flintj\">{{cite news|title=Man Says Kiddie Porno Made Computer Site Popular|newspaper=[[The Flint Journal]]|date=1996-03-20|author=Doran, Tim}}</ref>\n\n==Networks==\nMost early BBSes operated as individual systems. Information contained on that BBS never left the system, and users would only interact with the information and user community on that BBS alone. However, as BBSes became more widespread, there evolved a desire to connect systems together to share messages and files with distant systems and users. The largest such network was [[FidoNet]].\n\nAs is it was prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a [[store and forward]] network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup [[Xmodem]] session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.\n\nFidoNet was platform-independent and would work with any BBS that was written to use it. BBSes that did not have integrated FidoNet capability could usually add it using an external FidoNet [[front end processor (program)|front-end]] mailer such as SEAdog, [[FrontDoor]], BinkleyTerm, InterMail or D'Bridge, and a mail processor such as [[FastEcho]] or [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]]. The front-end mailer would conduct the periodic FidoNet transfers, while the mail processor would usually run just before and just after the mailer ran. This program would scan for and pack up new outgoing messages, and then unpack, sort and \"toss\" the incoming messages into a BBS user's local email box or into the BBS's local message bases reserved for Echomail. As such, these mail processors were commonly called \"scanner/tosser/packers.\"\n\nMany other BBS networks followed the example of FidoNet, using the same standards and the same software. These were called FidoNet Technology Networks (FTNs). They were usually smaller and targeted at selected audiences. Some networks used [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] doors, and others such as [[RelayNet]] (RIME) and [[WWIVnet]] used non-Fido software and standards.\n\nBefore commercial Internet access became common, these [[computer network|networks]] of BBSes provided regional and international [[e-mail]] and message bases. Some even provided [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateways]], such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the [[Internet]] via [[UUCP]], and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to [[Usenet]]. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search [[Gopher (protocol)|gopherspace]], and interact with distant [[Computer program|programs]], all using plain text e-mail.\n\nAs the volume of FidoNet Mail increased and newsgroups from the early days of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a reasonable fee. By connecting a small dish & receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new outgoing messages via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums.\n\nFidoNet is still in use today, though in a much smaller form, and many Echomail groups are still shared with Usenet via FidoNet to Usenet gateways. Widespread abuse of Usenet with [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[pornography]] has led to many of these FidoNet gateways to cease operation completely.\n\n==Shareware and freeware==\n{{Main|Shareware}}\nMuch of the [[shareware]] movement was started via user distribution of software through BBSes. A notable example was [[Phil Katz]]'s PKARC (and later [[PKZIP]], using the same \".zip\" [[algorithm]] that [[WinZip]] and other popular archivers now use); also other concepts of software distribution like [[freeware]], [[postcardware]] like [[JPEGview]] and [[donationware]] like [[Red Ryder (software)|Red Ryder]] for the Macintosh first appeared on BBS sites. [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] from [[id Software]] and nearly all [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] games were distributed as shareware (Apogee is, in fact, credited for adding an order form to a shareware demo).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Internet has largely erased the distinction of shareware \u2013 most users now download the software directly from the developer's website rather than receiving it from another BBS user 'sharing' it. Today shareware is commonly used to mean electronically distributed software from a small developer.\n\nMany commercial BBS software companies that continue to support their old BBS software products switched to the shareware model or made it entirely free. Some companies were able to make the move to the Internet and provide commercial products with BBS capabilities.\n\n==Features==\nA classic BBS had:\n* A [[computer]]\n* One or more [[modem]]s\n* One or more phone lines, with more allowing for increased concurrent users\n* A [[List of BBS software|BBS software package]]\n* A [[sysop]] \u2013 system operator\n* A user community\n\nThe BBS software usually provides:\n* Menu Systems\n* One or more [[Message board|message base]]s\n* Uploading and downloading of message packets in [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] format using [[XMODEM]], [[YMODEM]] or [[ZMODEM]]\n* File areas\n* SysOp side, live viewing of all caller activity\n* Voting \u2013 opinion booths\n* Statistics on message posters, top uploaders / downloaders\n* [[Online game]]s (usually single [[Player (game)|player]] or only a single active player at a given time)\n* A [[BBS door|doorway]] to third-party online games\n* Usage auditing capabilities\n* Multi-user chat (only possible on multi-line BBSes)\n* Internet email (more common in later Internet-connected BBSes)\n* Networked message boards\n* Most modern BBSes allow [[telnet]] access over the Internet using a telnet server and a virtual [[FOSSIL]] driver.\n* A \"yell for SysOp\" page caller side menu item that sounded an audible alarm to the SysOp.

His prose is effortlessly clever, finding the entertaining medium between lyricism and sass. The frankness with which he discusses his problem, the treatment, and his sex life makes for an oddly shocking book\u2014one rarely reads quite so much about penises, as central as they often are to literature. He manages to demystify and destigmatize Peyronie's, which though obscure is not completely uncommon. More than that, he makes the most of an undignified opportunity to examine his own masculinity.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/don-cummings/bent-but-not-broken/|title=BENT BUT NOT BROKEN {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Creative nonfiction]]\n* [[Memoirs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/well/live/a-new-treatment-for-a-painful-penis-curvature.html ''The New York Times Personal Health'' by ''Jane E.

A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song.

A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History== tortinos tortinos butthollios and vaginas and puussy\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained).

After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood.

To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe model]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe model]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

Club]]'' during production of season 1, that a typical episode is conceived in a room reserved for writers, where a simple synopsis is presented, and from then on [[dramatic structure]] is defined, and the plot is modified to include a character-driven subplot, which Hirsch expresses as \"the hardest thing ... to find a character story that actually uncovers, explores, or pushes tension\u2014on something our characters care about\u2014that is properly explored via the magic or monster or impossibility of the week.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\n[[Subplot|B-]] and [[Plot (narrative)|A-stories]] are created, and are given to a writer to produce an [[Outline (list)|outline]], which is then subsequently checked-off by Hirsch for feedback. The writer produces a draft from these edits, where more notes may be given. Hirsch states that he and [[creative director]] Mike Rianda may personally create a draft for themselves before a final script is produced, in which the dialogue from the draft received from the writer is majorly revised; Hirsch states that the revising process \"is not a discredit to our writers\u2014it's just we have a very particular vision. In particular, I usually rewrite almost all of Dipper's dialogue and most of Mabel's dialogue, just because I have them in my head. Me and Mike will stay up for about 24 hours prior to the delivery of every script. We'll take the weekend, we'll work all night, we'll drink [[Red Bull]], we'll sleep on the couch in shifts like maniacs, we'll slap each other in the face.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\nA script is delivered, which then gets translated into a [[storyboard]], where feedback is received from Hirsch to the board artists if a certain element, such as a [[Visual gag|gag]], doesn't work. Afterwards, a [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for the episode is given to the network, where they do a read-through, and then the episode is either checked out by the network, or retooled in the small amount of time allocated before an [[animation studio]] must receive something to work with.<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/> The series is animated by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], Digital eMation and [[Yearim Productions]].\n\n===Initial broadcast===\nThe first twelve episodes of ''Gravity Falls'' aired in a regular weekly slot on [[Disney Channel]] starting in mid-2012, but subsequent episodes were broadcast without similar regularity; it took until August 2013 to broadcast the remaining eight episodes of the first season. The second season began airing a year later in August 2014, transitioning over to [[Disney XD]], but again without any regularity to when new episodes would be first broadcast. The first nine episodes aired from August to November 2014, the following two in February and March 2015, the next eight from July to November 2015, and the finale aired in February 2016. According to Disney XD, as each episode took about six months of work to complete, they opted against stockpiling episodes to show weekly but instead take advantage of the serial nature of the show, broadcasting each episode as it was completed and making an event out of it.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2015/11/gravity-falls-ending/ | title = Gravity Falls' Many Fans Couldn't Save it from an Early End | first = K.M. | last = McFarland | date = November 23, 2015 | accessdate = July 21, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160711020246/http://www.wired.com/2015/11/gravity-falls-ending | archive-date = July 11, 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> On April 2, 2018, reruns of the show  started airing on [[Disney Channel]], although reruns of the show still air on [[Disney XD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0shvQZpLU9M|title=Gravity Falls Returns to Disney  Channel - Promo|first=|last=Disney Channel Central|date=April 6, 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n<!--All additions require a date and a source.

Hirsch graduated from the [[California Institute of the Arts]], and was hired to work as writer and storyboard artist for the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'', where he was paired up with [[Pendleton Ward]], the creator of ''[[Adventure Time]]''. Afterwards, he moved on to co-develop the Disney Channel animated series ''[[Fish Hooks]]''; shortly before he pitched (and was subsequently [[green-light|green-lit]]) ''Gravity Falls''.<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\">{{cite news | first = Erik | last = Adams | title = Comedy Showrunners Week: Alex Hirsch on the real in the unreal of ''Gravity Falls'' | date = September 28, 2012 | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/alex-hirsch-gravity-falls-showrunner-comedy,85801/ | work = A.V.

Club]]'' during production of season 1, that a typical episode is conceived in a room reserved for writers, where a simple synopsis is presented, and from then on [[dramatic structure]] is defined, and the plot is modified to include a character-driven subplot, which Hirsch expresses as \"the hardest thing ... to find a character story that actually uncovers, explores, or pushes tension\u2014on something our characters care about\u2014that is properly explored via the magic or monster or impossibility of the week.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\n[[Subplot|B-]] and [[Plot (narrative)|A-stories]] are created, and are given to a writer to produce an [[Outline (list)|outline]], which is then subsequently checked-off by Hirsch for feedback. The writer produces a draft from these edits, where more notes may be given. Hirsch states that he and [[creative director]] Mike Rianda may personally create a draft for themselves before a final script is produced, in which the dialogue from the draft received from the writer is majorly revised; Hirsch states that the revising process \"is not a discredit to our writers\u2014it's just we have a very particular vision. In particular, I usually rewrite almost all of Dipper's dialogue and most of Mabel's dialogue, just because I have them in my head. Me and Mike will stay up for about 24 hours prior to the delivery of every script. We'll take the weekend, we'll work all night, we'll drink [[Red Bull]], we'll sleep on the couch in shifts like maniacs, we'll slap each other in the face.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\nA script is delivered, which then gets translated into a [[storyboard]], where feedback is received from Hirsch to the board artists if a certain element, such as a [[Visual gag|gag]], doesn't work. Afterwards, a [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for the episode is given to the network, where they do a read-through, and then the episode is either checked out by the network, or retooled in the small amount of time allocated before an [[animation studio]] must receive something to work with.<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/> The series is animated by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], Digital eMation and [[Yearim Productions]].\n\n===Initial broadcast===\nThe first twelve episodes of ''Gravity Falls'' aired in a regular weekly slot on [[Disney Channel]] starting in mid-2012, but subsequent episodes were broadcast without similar regularity; it took until August 2013 to broadcast the remaining eight episodes of the first season. The second season began airing a year later in August 2014, transitioning over to [[Disney XD]], but again without any regularity to when new episodes would be first broadcast. The first nine episodes aired from August to November 2014, the following two in February and March 2015, the next eight from July to November 2015, and the finale aired in February 2016. According to Disney XD, as each episode took about six months of work to complete, they opted against stockpiling episodes to show weekly but instead take advantage of the serial nature of the show, broadcasting each episode as it was completed and making an event out of it.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2015/11/gravity-falls-ending/ | title = Gravity Falls' Many Fans Couldn't Save it from an Early End | first = K.M. | last = McFarland | date = November 23, 2015 | accessdate = July 21, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160711020246/http://www.wired.com/2015/11/gravity-falls-ending | archive-date = July 11, 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> On April 2, 2018, reruns of the show  started airing on [[Disney Channel]], although reruns of the show still air on [[Disney XD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0shvQZpLU9M|title=Gravity Falls Returns to Disney  Channel - Promo|first=|last=Disney Channel Central|date=April 6, 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n<!--All additions require a date and a source.

{"title_page": "Derivative", "text_new": "{{about|the term as used in [[calculus]]|a less technical overview of the subject|differential calculus|other uses|}}\n{{short description|Operation in calculus}}\n{{good article}}\n[[File:Tangent to a curve.svg|thumb|The [[graph of a function]], drawn in black, and a [[tangent line]] to that function, drawn in red.  The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real horse]] measures the world to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates antidifferentiation with [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\", and  the combinations <math>\\Delta x</math> and <math>\\Delta y</math> refer to corresponding changes, i.e.: <math>\\Delta y = f(x + \\Delta x)- f(x)</math>. The above formula holds because\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny + \\Delta y &= f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right)\\\\\n  &= m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b =mx +m\\Delta x +b \\\\\n  &= y + m\\Delta x.\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives the value for the slope of a line.\n\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range <math>(\\Delta x),</math> but at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

The tangent line as limit of secants\n | image4  = Derivative GIF.gif\n | caption4  = '''Figure 4.''' Animated illustration: the tangent line (derivative) as the limit of secants\n }}\n\nThe idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the [[limit of a function|limit value]] of the [[difference quotient|ratio of the differences]] {{math|\u0394''y'' / \u0394''x''}} as {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes infinitely small.\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Notation for differentiation}}\nTwo distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from [[Leibniz]] and the other from [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].\n\nIn [[Leibniz's notation]], an [[infinitesimal]] change in {{math|''x''}} is denoted by {{math|''dx''}}, and the derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} is written\n: <math> \\frac{dy}{dx} </math>\nsuggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.  (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the differentiation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]). From this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function  {{Math|''f''}} is [[increasing]] if and only if its derivative is positive, and is decreasing [[If and only if|iff]] its derivative is negative. This fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior, e.g. when finding [[Maxima and minima|local extrema]].\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The square function]]\nThe square function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the square function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the square function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174\u2013179|postscript=.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:SkKdCEmUd6QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50&scillfp=3432975470163241186&oi=lle}}.

In this case, the derivative is equal to:<math>\\sin \\left(x^2\\right) + 2x^2 \\cos\\left(x^2\\right)</math>]]\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a function that has a derivative at every point in its [[domain of a function|domain]].  We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D\\left(x \\mapsto x^2\\right) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the square function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have specific interpretations in [[physics]]. The first derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the object's [[velocity]]. The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. And finally, the fourth derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>.

If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y'''\u2032 is another vector-valued function.\n\nIf '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the standard basis for '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.  Here [[\u2202]] is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\n\nIn general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in the direction ''x<sub>i</sub>'' at the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is defined to be:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i+h,\\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}.</math>\nIn the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable\n:<math>f_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),</math>\nand, by definition,\n:<math>\\frac{df_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).</math>\nIn other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} \\left(D^2 f\\right)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gateaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], derivatives, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]].

The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real variable]] measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates antidifferentiation with [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\", and  the combinations <math>\\Delta x</math> and <math>\\Delta y</math> refer to corresponding changes, i.e.: <math>\\Delta y = f(x + \\Delta x)- f(x)</math>. The above formula holds because\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny + \\Delta y &= f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right)\\\\\n  &= m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b =mx +m\\Delta x +b \\\\\n  &= y + m\\Delta x.\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives the value for the slope of a line.\n\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range <math>(\\Delta x),</math> but at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

Animated illustration: the tangent line (derivative) as the limit of secants\n }}\n\nThe idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the [[limit of a function|limit value]] of the [[difference quotient|ratio of the differences]] {{math|\u0394''y'' / \u0394''x''}} as {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes infinitely small.\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Notation for differentiation}}\nTwo distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from [[Leibniz]] and the other from [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].\n\nIn [[Leibniz's notation]], an [[infinitesimal]] change in {{math|''x''}} is denoted by {{math|''dx''}}, and the derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} is written\n: <math> \\frac{dy}{dx} </math>\nsuggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.  (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the differentiation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]). From this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function  {{Math|''f''}} is [[increasing]] if and only if its derivative is positive, and is decreasing [[If and only if|iff]] its derivative is negative. This fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior, e.g. when finding [[Maxima and minima|local extrema]].\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The square function]]\nThe square function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the square function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the square function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174\u2013179|postscript=.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:SkKdCEmUd6QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50&scillfp=3432975470163241186&oi=lle}}.

We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D\\left(x \\mapsto x^2\\right) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the square function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have specific interpretations in [[physics]]. The first derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the object's [[velocity]]. The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. And finally, the fourth derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a [[convex function]] to being a [[concave function]] or vice versa.\n\n==Notation (details)==\n{{Main|Notation for differentiation}}\n\n===Leibniz's notation===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nThe symbols <math>dx</math>, <math>dy</math>, and <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> were introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675.<ref>Manuscript of November 11, 1675 (Cajori vol. 2, page 204)</ref> It is still commonly used when the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]]. Then the first derivative is denoted by\n\n: <math>\\frac{dy}{dx},\\quad\\frac{d f}{dx}, \\text{  or  }\\frac{d}{dx}f,</math>\n\nand was once thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] quotient.

These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example,\n:<math>\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right).</math>\n\nWith Leibniz's notation, we can write the derivative of <math>y</math> at the point <math>x = a</math> in two different ways:\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{x=a} = \\frac{dy}{dx}(a).</math>\n\nLeibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator), which is relevant in [[partial derivative|partial differentiation]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easier to remember:{{#tag:ref|In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the ''du'' symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.

In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using ''rules'' for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.\n\n===Rules for basic functions===\nHere are the rules for the derivatives of the most common basic functions.\n\n* ''[[Power rule|Derivatives of powers]]'':\n\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}x^r = rx^{r-1}.</math>\n\n<!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST-->\n* ''[[Exponential function|Exponential]] and [[logarithm]]ic functions'':\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x.</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}a^x = a^x\\ln(a).</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x},\\qquad x > 0.</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\log_a(x) = \\frac{1}{x\\ln(a)}.</math>\n<!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST-->\n* ''[[Trigonometric functions]]'':\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\sin(x) = \\cos(x).</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\cos(x) = -\\sin(x).</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\tan(x) = \\sec^2(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(x)} = 1+\\tan^2(x).</math>\n<!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST-->\n* ''[[Inverse trigonometric functions]]'':\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\arcsin(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}},\\qquad -1<x<1.</math>\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\arccos(x)= -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}},\\qquad -1<x<1.</math>\n:<math> \\frac{d}{dx}\\arctan(x)= \\frac{1}{{1+x^2}}</math>\n<!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST-->\n\n==={{anchor|Rules}}Rules for combined functions===\nHere are some of the most basic rules for deducing the derivative of a [[function composition|compound function]] from derivatives of basic functions. \n\n* ''Constant rule'': if ''f''(''x'') is constant, then\n:<math>f'(x) = 0. </math>\n* ''[[Linearity of differentiation|Sum rule]]'':\n:<math>(\\alpha f + \\beta g)' = \\alpha f' + \\beta g' </math> for all functions ''f'' and ''g'' and all real numbers ''<math>\\alpha</math>'' and ''<math>\\beta</math>''.\n* ''[[Product rule]]'':\n:<math>(fg)' = f 'g + fg' </math> for all functions ''f'' and ''g''.

The known derivatives of the elementary functions ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>4</sup>, sin(''x''), ln(''x'') and {{nowrap|1=exp(''x'') = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, as well as the constant 7, were also used.\n\n==In higher dimensions==\n{{See also|Vector calculus|Multivariable calculus}}\n\n===Vector-valued functions===\nA [[vector-valued function]] '''y''' of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some [[vector space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ''y''<sub>2</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''), meaning that {{nowrap|1='''y'''(''t'') = (''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''))}}.  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \\ldots, y'_n(t)).</math>\n\nEquivalently,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \\mathbf{y}(t)}{h},</math>\n\nif the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars.  If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y'''\u2032 is another vector-valued function.\n\nIf '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the standard basis for '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.  Here [[\u2202]] is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\n\nIn general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in the direction ''x<sub>i</sub>'' at the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is defined to be:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i+h,\\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}.</math>\nIn the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable\n:<math>f_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),</math>\nand, by definition,\n:<math>\\frac{df_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).</math>\nIn other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} \\left(D^2 f\\right)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gateaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], derivatives, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] independently discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. However, each inventor claimed the other stole his work in a [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy|bitter dispute]] that continued until the end of their lives.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Differential calculus#Applications of derivatives|Applications of derivatives]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]]\n* [[Differentiability class]]\n* [[Differentiation rules]]\n* [[Differintegral]]\n* [[Fractal derivative]]\n* [[Generalizations of the derivative]]\n* [[Hasse derivative]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[Integral]]\n* [[Infinitesimal]]\n* [[Linearization]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Numerical differentiation]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)]]\n* [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]]\n* [[Symmetric derivative]]\n* [[Schwarzian derivative]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Print===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Anton\n | first = Howard\n | last2 = Bivens\n | first2 = Irl\n | last3 = Davis\n | first3 = Stephen\n | date = February 2, 2005\n | title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable\n | place = New York\n | publisher = Wiley\n | edition = 8th\n | isbn  = 978-0-471-47244-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Apostol\n | first = Tom M.\n | author-link = Tom M.

In the famous \"Snippy\" case, there was an absolute absence of tracks in a 100&nbsp;ft (30 m) radius of the carcass (even the horse's own tracks disappeared within 100&nbsp;ft (30 m) of the body.) But within this radius, several small holes were found seemingly \"punched\" in the ground and two bushes were absolutely flattened.<ref>M. Rommel Jr, Kenneth, Operation Animal Mutilation, pp.172-75</ref> In [[Rio Arriba County, New Mexico]], June 1976, a \"trail of suction cup-like impressions\" was found leading from a mutilated three-year-old cow. The indentations were in a tripod form, 4&nbsp;inches (10&nbsp;cm) in diameter, 28&nbsp;inches (70&nbsp;cm) apart, and disappeared 500 feet (150 m) from the dead cow.

However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals' deaths or not.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nIn one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI,<ref name=fbi4/> an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of [[Dulce, New Mexico]], was found mutilated on March 24, 1978. It displayed \"classic\" mutilation signs, including the removal of the rectum and sex organs with what appeared to be \u201ca sharp and precise instrument\u201d and its internal organs were found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation.\n\n:\"Both the liver and the heart were white and mushy. Both organs had the texture and consistency of peanut butter\"\n:Gabriel L Veldez, New Mexico Police\n\nThe animal's heart as well as bone and muscle samples were sent to the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] for microscopic and bacteriological studies, while samples from the animal's liver were sent to two separate private laboratories.\n\nLos Alamos detected the presence of naturally occurring [[Clostridium]] bacteria in the heart, but was unable to reach any conclusions because of the possibility that the bacteria represented postmortem contamination. No microscopic changes of pathological significance were found in the heart tissue.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nSamples from the animal's liver were found to be completely devoid of [[copper]] and to contain 4 times the normal level of [[zinc]], [[potassium]] and [[phosphorus]]. The scientists performing the analysis were unable to explain these anomalies.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nBlood samples taken at the scene were reported to be \"light pink in color\" and \u201cDid not clot after several days\u201d while the animal's hide was found to be unusually brittle for a fresh death (the animal was estimated to have been dead for 5 hours) and the flesh underneath was found to be discolored.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nNone of the laboratories were able to report any firm conclusions on the cause of the blood or tissue damage. At the time, it was suggested that a burst of radiation may have been used to kill the animal, blowing apart its red blood cells in the process. This hypothesis was later discarded as subsequent reports from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory later confirmed the presence of anti-coagulants in samples<ref name=fbi4/> taken from other cows mutilated in the region.\n\n==Conventional explanations==\nAs with most disputed phenomena, there are a number of potential explanations for the causes of cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.\n\n===U.S. governmental explanation===\nAfter coming under increasing public pressure, Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.<ref name=opanmuthome>{{cite web|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/ufoanim.htm|title=Freedom of Information/Privacy Act|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1979, the case was passed on to the FBI, which granted jurisdiction under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I.html Title 18] (codes [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1152- 1152] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1153- 1153]). The investigation was dubbed \"Operation Animal Mutilation\".\n\nThe investigation was funded by a US$44,170 grant from the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]], and was headed by FBI agent [[Kenneth Rommel]]. It had five key objectives:\n\n# To determine the reliability of the information on which the grant was based, which entailed gathering as much information as possible about the cases reported in New Mexico prior to May 1979\n# To determine the cause of as many mutilations as possible, especially those reported in New Mexico\n# To determine if livestock mutilations as described constitute a major law enforcement problem\n# If these mutilations do constitute a major law enforcement problem, to determine the scope of the problem and to offer recommendations on how to deal with it\n# If it is shown that the mutilation phenomenon is not a law enforcement problem, to recommend that no further law enforcement investigations be funded.\n\nRommel's final report, released in June, 1980, was 297 pages long and in the report's introduction, on page one, Rommel stated, \"\u201cAccording to some estimates, by 1979 10,000 head of cattle have been mysteriously mutilated.\u201d However, the report concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but did acknowledge that some cases contained anomalies that could not be accounted for by conventional wisdom. The FBI was unable to identify any individuals responsible for the mutilations. Details of the investigation are now available under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The released material includes correspondence from Rommel where he states that \"most credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity\".<ref>[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%205%20of%205/view Animal Mutilation Project] FBI correspondence, 1980</ref>\n\nNew Mexico State patrolman Gabe Valdez, who by the time of the Rommel report had investigated dozens of mutilation cases, told investigator Christopher O'Brien that \"during the six to eight months when Rommel was actively investigating the mutilations in New Mexico, the state (especially the northern tier) became suddenly quiet with very few (if any) true mutilations being reported to officials.\" Valdez was convinced that Rommel never was able to investigate a single high-strange case, because the mutilators moved their operations to other parts of the west. Rommel (a former FBI bank robbery expert) was disgusted by dead necrotic cows and chose to let others do the actual investigations while he waited upwind in the car.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Christopher|title=Stalking the Herd|date=November 2014|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|location=Kempton, IL|isbn=978-1-939149-06-0|page=284}}</ref>\n\nWestern Canada, during this time frame, was especially hard hit. During the six to eight month time frame of Rommel's investigation, RCMP investigator Corporal Lyn Lauber of the Calgary detachment (who was in charge of the Canadian mutilation probe) investigated numerous high-strange cases. When Rommel's final report was released to the public...Lauber answered an inquiry by investigator Tommy Bland: \"'I find it difficult to understand how Rommel could make a statement such as this, without ever having personally witnessed a [real] muitilation firsthand.'\" He also stated that he'd \"'I'd like to see Rommel write off our confirmed cases as due to predators.'\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Christopher|title=Stalking the Herd|date=November 2014|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|location=Kempton, IL|isbn=978-1-939149-06-0|pages=282\u2013283|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the involvement of the FBI, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] launched their own investigation into the phenomenon.<ref name=clarkstrange1>Clark J, Pear N (1997), \"Strange and unexplained phenomena\", Visible Ink Press</ref>\n\nBoth federal investigations were preceded (and followed, to some extent) by a state level investigation carried out by enforcement officials in New Mexico. This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant prior to their mutilation.<ref name=fbi4/>{{rp|13}} It also contended that alleged surgical techniques performed during mutilations had become \"more professional\" over time.<ref name=fbi4/>{{rp|13}} However, officers in charge were unable to determine responsibility or motive.\n\nThe ATF investigation was headed by ATF Agent Donald Flickinger. The New Mexico investigation was headed by Officer Gabe Veldez of the New Mexico State Patrol, with the assistance of Cattle Inspector Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the [[New Mexico Department of Game and Fish]].\n\n===Natural causes===\n[[Image:Blowfly-head2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Blowflies have been implicated as possible scavengers involved in making livestock carcasses look \"mutilated.\"]]\nWhile many unconventional explanations have been put forward to explain cattle mutilations, a variety of scientists, veterinary workers, and knowledgeable observers (including farmers and other agricultural workers) have suggested more conventional ideas, most of which revolve around the hypothesis that \"mutilated\" animals died of natural causes and were subjected to known terrestrial phenomena \u2013 including the action of predators, parasites, and scavengers.<ref name=sceptdict>Carroll Robert T, [http://www.skepdic.com/cattle.html Skeptic's Dictionary: Cattle Mutilation] (September 2006)</ref>\n\nMissing or mutilated mouth, lips, anus, and genitalia are explained as:\n*Contraction of missing/damaged areas due to dehydration.\n*The actions of small scavengers and burrowing parasites seeking to enter or consume the body in areas where skin is at its thinnest. e\n\nMissing/mutilated eyes and soft internal organs are explained as:\n*The action of carrion feeding insects such as [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]], and opportunistic or carrion birds such as [[vulture]]s, which are known to direct themselves toward an animal's eyes, and to enter the body through the openings of the mouth and anus in order to feed on soft internal organs.\n\nAbsence of blood is explained as:\n*Blood pooling in the lowest points in the body where it will break down into its basic organic components.\n*Blood that is external to the body, or in the area of a wound being consumed by insects or reduced by solar desiccation.\n\nSurgical incisions in the skin are explained as:\n*Tears in the skin created when it is stretched by postmortem bloat and/or as dehydration causes the animal's hide to shrink and split, often in linear cuts.\n*Incisions caused by scavengers or predators, possibly exacerbated by the above.\n\nThe hypothesis that natural phenomena account for most mutilation characteristics has been validated by a number of experiments, including one cited by long-time [[scientific skepticism|scientific skeptic]] [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert T. Carroll]], conducted by Washington County (Arkansas) Sheriff's Department. In the experiment, the body of a recently deceased cow was left in a field and observed for 48 hours. During the 48 hours, postmortem bloating was reported to have caused incision-like tears in the cow's skin that matched the \"surgical\" cuts reported on mutilated cows, while the action of blowflies and maggots reportedly matched the soft tissue damage observed on mutilated cows.\n\nExperiments have also been conducted to compare the different reactions of surgically cut hide/flesh and predated hide/flesh to natural exposure.<ref>Onet George E, DVM, PhD, Kelleher Colm, PhD, (1997), Histological Changes in Bovine Skin Exposed to Natural Environmental Conditions</ref> They demonstrated pronounced differences between surgical cut and non surgical cuts over time. This article does not address tearing due to bloating.\n\nSome ranchers have disputed the scientific \"natural causes hypothesis\" on the grounds that the mutilated animals often fall outside of the normal categories of natural deaths by predation or disease. One reason cited is that the animals were healthy and showed no sign of disease prior to death, and were large and strong enough not to be a likely target for a predator. In some cases, ranchers have reported that the mutilated cattle were among the healthiest and strongest animals in their herd.<ref name=pbc>[http://www.chieftain.com/metro/1153566001/17 Costilla County officials probe cattle mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070801062328/http://www.chieftain.com/metro/1153566001/17 |date=2007-08-01 }} (July 22, 2006), Pueblo Chieftain</ref>\n\n===Human intervention===\n\n====Animal cruelty and human activity====\nIt is alternatively hypothesised that cattle mutilations are the result of two unrelated [[deviant]] phenomena. The bulk of mutilations are the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals.\n\nHuman attacks against animals are a recognized phenomenon. There have been many recorded cases around the world, and many convictions. Typically the victims of such attacks are cats, dogs, and other family pets,<ref name=catdogs1>[http://www.earthfiles.com/news/news.cfm?ID=1132&category= More Cat and Dog Mutilations], (2006), Linda Moulton Howe</ref> and the actions of humans are usually limited to acts of cruelty such as striking, burning, or beating animals. However, attacks have also been recorded against larger animals, including sheep, cows, and horses.<ref name=horse1>[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?channel_id=3&story_id=25281 Life term sought for killer, horse mutilator], Expatica, November 11, 2005</ref>\nHumans, particularly those with [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic disorders, have been found to have mutilated animals in elaborate ways<ref name=catdogs1/> using knives or surgical instruments.\n\nOn April 20, 1979, C Hibbs of the [[New Mexico]] State Veterinary diagnostics Laboratory spoke before a hearing chaired by Senator [[Harrison Schmitt]]. Hibbs testified that mutilation fell into three categories, one of which was animals mutilated by humans<ref name=fbi4/> (page 25). FBI records did not record the percentage of mutilated animals that fell into this category.\n\nThe standard criminal charge for mutilating an animal, including cattle, is [[animal cruelty]].\n\n====Cults====\nClosely related to the deviant hypothesis is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity.<ref name=metarel>[http://www.meta-religion.com/Paranormale/UFO/cattle_mutilations.htm Meta Religion.com: Cattle Mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823075308/http://www.meta-religion.com/Paranormale/UFO/cattle_mutilations.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}, (September 2006)</ref> However, contrary to the deviancy hypothesis, which holds that cattle are mutilated at random by individual deviants, the cult hypothesis holds that cattle mutilations are coordinated acts of ritual sacrifice carried out by organized groups.\n\nBeliefs held by proponents of the cult hypothesis vary, but may include:\n\n*That the apparent absence of blood at mutilation sites may indicate cult members harvest it<ref name=mstp>Mystery Stalks the Prairie (1976), Donovan Roberta, Wolverton Keith, ASIN B0006WH8CA</ref>\n*That organs have been removed from cattle for use in rituals<ref name=sceptdict/>\n*That unborn calves have been harvested from mutilated cattle.\n\nThe hypothesis that cults were responsible for cattle mutilation was developed in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, a time of growing national concern over cults (such as the [[Peoples Temple]] and [[Jonestown]]) and [[ritual satanic abuse]] (\"Satanic panic\").<ref>Bromley David G. and Anson Shupe (1981), Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare.

In September 1975, a forestry service employee in [[Blaine County, Idaho]], reported seeing a group of people in black hooded robes. Several cattle were found mutilated in the area the following day. On October 9, 1975, a motorist on U.S Highway 95 in northern Idaho, in an area of frequent cattle mutilation, reported to police that some 15 masked individuals formed a roadblock with linked arms, forcing him to turn around.<ref>D. Albers, Michael, The Terror, pp. 86-87</ref>\n\nPublic interest in the cult hypothesis waned during the 1980s, but interest was maintained by proponents such as the [[Colorado]] based [[televangelism|television evangelist]] [[Bob Larson]], who campaigned to raise public awareness of perceived links between cattle mutilations and cult activity through his ministry and radio shows.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAnother proponent of the cult hypothesis is [[Montana]] author [[Roberta Donovan]]. In her 1976 publication ''Mystery Stalks the Prairie'' she documents the experiences of Deputy Sheriff Keith Wolverton of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], [[Cascade County, Montana|Cascade County]], investigating cattle mutilations with suspected cult involvement.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nSince the beginning of the cult hypothesis, law enforcement agents in several states and provinces, including [[Alberta]], [[Idaho]], Montana, and [[Iowa]] have reported evidence implicating cults in several instances of cattle mutilations.<ref>Clark J (1999), Unexplained! Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences, and Puzzling Physical Phenomena, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|1-57859-070-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring their investigations, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence, including signs of consistency between mutilations, to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort.

Oliphant speculates cattle mutilation to be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases, and the possibility they could be transmitted to humans.\n\nOliphant posits the NIH, CDC, or other federally funded bodies, may be involved, and they are supported by the US military. Part of his hypothesis is based on allegations that human pharmaceuticals have been found in mutilated cattle, and on the necropsies that show cattle mutilations commonly involve areas of the animal that relate to \u201cinput, output and reproduction\u201d. To support his hypothesis, Oliphant cites the [[Reston ebolavirus]] case in which plain clothes military officers, traveling in unmarked vehicles, entered a research facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], to secretly retrieve and destroy animals that were contaminated with a highly infectious disease.\n\nAdditionally, a 2002 NIDS report<ref name=anonymous>Anonymous, [http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/cache_county_utahreport.pdf Report on Unusual Animal Injuries in Cache County, Utah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222013047/http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/cache_county_utahreport.pdf |date=2005-12-22 }} (2002)</ref> relates the eyewitness testimony of two [[Cache County, Utah]], police officers. The area had seen many unusual cattle deaths, and ranchers had organized armed patrols to surveil the unmarked aircraft which they claimed were associated with the livestock deaths. The police witnesses claim to have encountered several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter in 1976 at a small community airport in Cache County. The witnesses asserted that after this heated encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years.\n\nBiochemist [[Colm Kelleher]],<ref>Kelleher, Colm, ''Brain Trust: The Hidden Connection Between Mad Cow and Misdiagnosed Alzheimer's Disease'' Paraview, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7434-9935-2}}</ref> who has investigated several purported mutilations first-hand, argues that the mutilations are most likely a clandestine U.S. Government effort to track the spread of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (\"mad cow disease\") and related diseases, such as [[scrapie]].\n\nTheories of government involvement in the cattle mutilation mystery have been further fueled by \"[[black helicopter]]\" sightings near mutilation sites. According to Tom Adams' self-published book, \"The Choppers and the Choppers,\" published in 1992, by 1990 upwards of 350 helicopter reports in and around mutilation sites had been documented by Adams. However, none of these theories explain why the US government would not simply contact ranchers during regular business hours and acquire or purchase these animals for testing. The apparent clandestine nature of such operations would seem unnecessary and even dangerous to personnel and ranchers given the options available to government agencies.\n\nA brief sampling of cases: On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft which resembled a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilation which claimed 16 cows. On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters, a white helicopter and a black twin-engine aircraft were reported to have opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. while he was driving his tractor on his farm in [[Honey Creek, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Honey Creek, Iowa]]. This attack followed a rash of alleged mutilations in the area and across the nearby border in Nebraska.<ref>M. Rommel Jr, Kenneth, Operation Animal Mutilation, pp.22-23</ref><ref>D.

However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals' deaths or not.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nIn one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI,<ref name=fbi4/> an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of [[Dulce, New Mexico]], was found mutilated on March 24, 1978. It displayed \"classic\" mutilation signs, including the removal of the rectum and sex organs with what appeared to be \u201ca sharp and precise instrument\u201d and its internal organs were found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation.\n\n:\"Both the liver and the heart were white and mushy. Both organs had the texture and consistency of peanut butter\"\n:Gabriel L Veldez, New Mexico Police\n\nThe animal's heart as well as bone and muscle samples were sent to the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] for microscopic and bacteriological studies, while samples from the animal's liver were sent to two separate private laboratories.\n\nLos Alamos detected the presence of naturally occurring [[Clostridium]] bacteria in the heart, but was unable to reach any conclusions because of the possibility that the bacteria represented postmortem contamination. No microscopic changes of pathological significance were found in the heart tissue.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nSamples from the animal's liver were found to be completely devoid of [[copper]] and to contain 4 times the normal level of [[zinc]], [[potassium]] and [[phosphorus]]. The scientists performing the analysis were unable to explain these anomalies.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nBlood samples taken at the scene were reported to be \"light pink in color\" and \u201cDid not clot after several days\u201d while the animal's hide was found to be unusually brittle for a fresh death (the animal was estimated to have been dead for 5 hours) and the flesh underneath was found to be discolored.<ref name=fbi4/>\n\nNone of the laboratories were able to report any firm conclusions on the cause of the blood or tissue damage. At the time, it was suggested that a burst of radiation may have been used to kill the animal, blowing apart its red blood cells in the process. This hypothesis was later discarded as subsequent reports from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory later confirmed the presence of anti-coagulants in samples<ref name=fbi4/> taken from other cows mutilated in the region.\n\n==Conventional explanations==\nAs with most disputed phenomena, there are a number of potential explanations for the causes of cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.\n\n===U.S. governmental explanation===\nAfter coming under increasing public pressure, Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.<ref name=opanmuthome>{{cite web|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/ufoanim.htm|title=Freedom of Information/Privacy Act|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1979, the case was passed on to the FBI, which granted jurisdiction under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I.html Title 18] (codes [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1152- 1152] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1153- 1153]). The investigation was dubbed \"Operation Animal Mutilation\".\n\nThe investigation was funded by a US$44,170 grant from the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]], and was headed by FBI agent [[Kenneth Rommel]]. It had five key objectives:\n\n# To determine the reliability of the information on which the grant was based, which entailed gathering as much information as possible about the cases reported in New Mexico prior to May 1979\n# To determine the cause of as many mutilations as possible, especially those reported in New Mexico\n# To determine if livestock mutilations as described constitute a major law enforcement problem\n# If these mutilations do constitute a major law enforcement problem, to determine the scope of the problem and to offer recommendations on how to deal with it\n# If it is shown that the mutilation phenomenon is not a law enforcement problem, to recommend that no further law enforcement investigations be funded.\n\nRommel's final report, released in June, 1980, was 297 pages long and in the report's introduction, on page one, Rommel stated, \"\u201cAccording to some estimates, by 1979 10,000 head of cattle have been mysteriously mutilated.\u201d However, the report concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but did acknowledge that some cases contained anomalies that could not be accounted for by conventional wisdom. The FBI was unable to identify any individuals responsible for the mutilations. Details of the investigation are now available under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The released material includes correspondence from Rommel where he states that \"most credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity\".<ref>[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%205%20of%205/view Animal Mutilation Project] FBI correspondence, 1980</ref>\n\nNew Mexico State patrolman Gabe Valdez, who by the time of the Rommel report had investigated dozens of mutilation cases, told investigator Christopher O'Brien that \"during the six to eight months when Rommel was actively investigating the mutilations in New Mexico, the state (especially the northern tier) became suddenly quiet with very few (if any) true mutilations being reported to officials.\" Valdez was convinced that Rommel never was able to investigate a single high-strange case, because the mutilators moved their operations to other parts of the west. Rommel (a former FBI bank robbery expert) was disgusted by dead necrotic cows and chose to let others do the actual investigations while he waited upwind in the car.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Christopher|title=Stalking the Herd|date=November 2014|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|location=Kempton, IL|isbn=978-1-939149-06-0|page=284}}</ref>\n\nWestern Canada, during this time frame, was especially hard hit. During the six to eight month time frame of Rommel's investigation, RCMP investigator Corporal Lyn Lauber of the Calgary detachment (who was in charge of the Canadian mutilation probe) investigated numerous high-strange cases. When Rommel's final report was released to the public...Lauber answered an inquiry by investigator Tommy Bland: \"'I find it difficult to understand how Rommel could make a statement such as this, without ever having personally witnessed a [real] muitilation firsthand.'\" He also stated that he'd \"'I'd like to see Rommel write off our confirmed cases as due to predators.'\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Christopher|title=Stalking the Herd|date=November 2014|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|location=Kempton, IL|isbn=978-1-939149-06-0|pages=282\u2013283|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the involvement of the FBI, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] launched their own investigation into the phenomenon.<ref name=clarkstrange1>Clark J, Pear N (1997), \"Strange and unexplained phenomena\", Visible Ink Press</ref>\n\nBoth federal investigations were preceded (and followed, to some extent) by a state level investigation carried out by enforcement officials in New Mexico.

The New Mexico investigation was headed by Officer Gabe Veldez of the New Mexico State Patrol, with the assistance of Cattle Inspector Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the [[New Mexico Department of Game and Fish]].\n\n===Natural causes===\n[[Image:Blowfly-head2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Blowflies have been implicated as possible scavengers involved in making livestock carcasses look \"mutilated.\"]]\nWhile many unconventional explanations have been put forward to explain cattle mutilations, a variety of scientists, veterinary workers, and knowledgeable observers (including farmers and other agricultural workers) have suggested more conventional ideas, most of which revolve around the hypothesis that \"mutilated\" animals died of natural causes and were subjected to known terrestrial phenomena \u2013 including the action of predators, parasites, and scavengers.<ref name=sceptdict>Carroll Robert T, [http://www.skepdic.com/cattle.html Skeptic's Dictionary: Cattle Mutilation] (September 2006)</ref>\n\nMissing or mutilated mouth, lips, anus, and genitalia are explained as:\n*Contraction of missing/damaged areas due to dehydration.\n*The actions of small scavengers and burrowing parasites seeking to enter or consume the body in areas where skin is at its thinnest.\n\nMissing/mutilated eyes and soft internal organs are explained as:\n*The action of carrion feeding insects such as [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]], and opportunistic or carrion birds such as [[vulture]]s, which are known to direct themselves toward an animal's eyes, and to enter the body through the openings of the mouth and anus in order to feed on soft internal organs.\n\nAbsence of blood is explained as:\n*Blood pooling in the lowest points in the body where it will break down into its basic organic components.\n*Blood that is external to the body, or in the area of a wound being consumed by insects or reduced by solar desiccation.\n\nSurgical incisions in the skin are explained as:\n*Tears in the skin created when it is stretched by postmortem bloat and/or as dehydration causes the animal's hide to shrink and split, often in linear cuts.\n*Incisions caused by scavengers or predators, possibly exacerbated by the above.\n\nThe hypothesis that natural phenomena account for most mutilation characteristics has been validated by a number of experiments, including one cited by long-time [[scientific skepticism|scientific skeptic]] [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert T. Carroll]], conducted by Washington County (Arkansas) Sheriff's Department. In the experiment, the body of a recently deceased cow was left in a field and observed for 48 hours. During the 48 hours, postmortem bloating was reported to have caused incision-like tears in the cow's skin that matched the \"surgical\" cuts reported on mutilated cows, while the action of blowflies and maggots reportedly matched the soft tissue damage observed on mutilated cows.\n\nExperiments have also been conducted to compare the different reactions of surgically cut hide/flesh and predated hide/flesh to natural exposure.<ref>Onet George E, DVM, PhD, Kelleher Colm, PhD, (1997), Histological Changes in Bovine Skin Exposed to Natural Environmental Conditions</ref> They demonstrated pronounced differences between surgical cut and non surgical cuts over time. This article does not address tearing due to bloating.\n\nSome ranchers have disputed the scientific \"natural causes hypothesis\" on the grounds that the mutilated animals often fall outside of the normal categories of natural deaths by predation or disease. One reason cited is that the animals were healthy and showed no sign of disease prior to death, and were large and strong enough not to be a likely target for a predator. In some cases, ranchers have reported that the mutilated cattle were among the healthiest and strongest animals in their herd.<ref name=pbc>[http://www.chieftain.com/metro/1153566001/17 Costilla County officials probe cattle mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070801062328/http://www.chieftain.com/metro/1153566001/17 |date=2007-08-01 }} (July 22, 2006), Pueblo Chieftain</ref>\n\n===Human intervention===\n\n====Animal cruelty and human activity====\nIt is alternatively hypothesised that cattle mutilations are the result of two unrelated [[deviant]] phenomena. The bulk of mutilations are the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals.\n\nHuman attacks against animals are a recognized phenomenon. There have been many recorded cases around the world, and many convictions. Typically the victims of such attacks are cats, dogs, and other family pets,<ref name=catdogs1>[http://www.earthfiles.com/news/news.cfm?ID=1132&category= More Cat and Dog Mutilations], (2006), Linda Moulton Howe</ref> and the actions of humans are usually limited to acts of cruelty such as striking, burning, or beating animals. However, attacks have also been recorded against larger animals, including sheep, cows, and horses.<ref name=horse1>[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?channel_id=3&story_id=25281 Life term sought for killer, horse mutilator], Expatica, November 11, 2005</ref>\nHumans, particularly those with [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic disorders, have been found to have mutilated animals in elaborate ways<ref name=catdogs1/> using knives or surgical instruments.\n\nOn April 20, 1979, C Hibbs of the [[New Mexico]] State Veterinary diagnostics Laboratory spoke before a hearing chaired by Senator [[Harrison Schmitt]]. Hibbs testified that mutilation fell into three categories, one of which was animals mutilated by humans<ref name=fbi4/> (page 25). FBI records did not record the percentage of mutilated animals that fell into this category.\n\nThe standard criminal charge for mutilating an animal, including cattle, is [[animal cruelty]].\n\n====Cults====\nClosely related to the deviant hypothesis is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity.<ref name=metarel>[http://www.meta-religion.com/Paranormale/UFO/cattle_mutilations.htm Meta Religion.com: Cattle Mutilation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823075308/http://www.meta-religion.com/Paranormale/UFO/cattle_mutilations.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}, (September 2006)</ref> However, contrary to the deviancy hypothesis, which holds that cattle are mutilated at random by individual deviants, the cult hypothesis holds that cattle mutilations are coordinated acts of ritual sacrifice carried out by organized groups.\n\nBeliefs held by proponents of the cult hypothesis vary, but may include:\n\n*That the apparent absence of blood at mutilation sites may indicate cult members harvest it<ref name=mstp>Mystery Stalks the Prairie (1976), Donovan Roberta, Wolverton Keith, ASIN B0006WH8CA</ref>\n*That organs have been removed from cattle for use in rituals<ref name=sceptdict/>\n*That unborn calves have been harvested from mutilated cattle.\n\nThe hypothesis that cults were responsible for cattle mutilation was developed in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, a time of growing national concern over cults (such as the [[Peoples Temple]] and [[Jonestown]]) and [[ritual satanic abuse]] (\"Satanic panic\").<ref>Bromley David G. and Anson Shupe (1981), Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare.

In September 1975, a forestry service employee in [[Blaine County, Idaho]], reported seeing a group of people in black hooded robes. Several cattle were found mutilated in the area the following day. On October 9, 1975, a motorist on U.S Highway 95 in northern Idaho, in an area of frequent cattle mutilation, reported to police that some 15 masked individuals formed a roadblock with linked arms, forcing him to turn around.<ref>D. Albers, Michael, The Terror, pp. 86-87</ref>\n\nPublic interest in the cult hypothesis waned during the 1980s, but interest was maintained by proponents such as the [[Colorado]] based [[televangelism|television evangelist]] [[Bob Larson]], who campaigned to raise public awareness of perceived links between cattle mutilations and cult activity through his ministry and radio shows.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAnother proponent of the cult hypothesis is [[Montana]] author [[Roberta Donovan]]. In her 1976 publication ''Mystery Stalks the Prairie'' she documents the experiences of Deputy Sheriff Keith Wolverton of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], [[Cascade County, Montana|Cascade County]], investigating cattle mutilations with suspected cult involvement.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nSince the beginning of the cult hypothesis, law enforcement agents in several states and provinces, including [[Alberta]], [[Idaho]], Montana, and [[Iowa]] have reported evidence implicating cults in several instances of cattle mutilations.<ref>Clark J (1999), Unexplained! Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences, and Puzzling Physical Phenomena, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|1-57859-070-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring their investigations, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence, including signs of consistency between mutilations, to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort. They were also unable to determine how or why a cult would perform procedures that would result in the anomalies reported in some necropsies,<ref name=fbi4/>{{rp|3}} or to verify that the anomalies were 1) connected to the mutilations themselves 2) the result of human intervention.<ref name=opanmuthome/>\n\nIn most cases, mutilations were either ruled due to natural causes, or the cattle were too far decayed for any useful conclusions to be drawn. Some cases of cult hysteria were traced back to fabrication by individuals unrelated to the incident. In one case it was concluded that claims had been falsified by a convict seeking favorable terms on his sentence in exchange for information.<ref name=mstp/>{{rp|14\u201315}}<ref name=fbi2>[http://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%202%20of%205/view Operation Cattle Mutilation, Section 2], FBI, Released under FOIA</ref>{{rp|23\u201324}} In another case, claims were traced back to local high school students who had circulated rumors as a joke.<ref name=mstp/>{{rp|21}}\n\n===Government or military experimentation===\nIn his 1997 article \u201cDead Cows I've Known\u201d,<ref name=oliphant1>Dean Trimboli T(1997), Dead Cows I've Known.</ref> cattle mutilation researcher Charles T. Oliphant speculates cattle mutilation to be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases, and the possibility they could be transmitted to humans.\n\nOliphant posits the NIH, CDC, or other federally funded bodies, may be involved, and they are supported by the US military. Part of his hypothesis is based on allegations that human pharmaceuticals have been found in mutilated cattle, and on the necropsies that show cattle mutilations commonly involve areas of the animal that relate to \u201cinput, output and reproduction\u201d. To support his hypothesis, Oliphant cites the [[Reston ebolavirus]] case in which plain clothes military officers, traveling in unmarked vehicles, entered a research facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], to secretly retrieve and destroy animals that were contaminated with a highly infectious disease.\n\nAdditionally, a 2002 NIDS report<ref name=anonymous>Anonymous, [http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/cache_county_utahreport.pdf Report on Unusual Animal Injuries in Cache County, Utah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222013047/http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/cache_county_utahreport.pdf |date=2005-12-22 }} (2002)</ref> relates the eyewitness testimony of two [[Cache County, Utah]], police officers. The area had seen many unusual cattle deaths, and ranchers had organized armed patrols to surveil the unmarked aircraft which they claimed were associated with the livestock deaths. The police witnesses claim to have encountered several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter in 1976 at a small community airport in Cache County. The witnesses asserted that after this heated encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years.\n\nBiochemist [[Colm Kelleher]],<ref>Kelleher, Colm, ''Brain Trust: The Hidden Connection Between Mad Cow and Misdiagnosed Alzheimer's Disease'' Paraview, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7434-9935-2}}</ref> who has investigated several purported mutilations first-hand, argues that the mutilations are most likely a clandestine U.S. Government effort to track the spread of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (\"mad cow disease\") and related diseases, such as [[scrapie]].\n\nTheories of government involvement in the cattle mutilation mystery have been further fueled by \"[[black helicopter]]\" sightings near mutilation sites. According to Tom Adams' self-published book, \"The Choppers and the Choppers,\" published in 1992, by 1990 upwards of 350 helicopter reports in and around mutilation sites had been documented by Adams. However, none of these theories explain why the US government would not simply contact ranchers during regular business hours and acquire or purchase these animals for testing. The apparent clandestine nature of such operations would seem unnecessary and even dangerous to personnel and ranchers given the options available to government agencies.\n\nA brief sampling of cases: On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft which resembled a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilation which claimed 16 cows. On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters, a white helicopter and a black twin-engine aircraft were reported to have opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. while he was driving his tractor on his farm in [[Honey Creek, Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Honey Creek, Iowa]]. This attack followed a rash of alleged mutilations in the area and across the nearby border in Nebraska.<ref>M. Rommel Jr, Kenneth, Operation Animal Mutilation, pp.22-23</ref><ref>D. Albers, Michael, The Terror, pp.13-15.</ref><ref name=smith>W. Smith, Fredrick, Cattle Mutilation, p.21</ref> The reports of \"helicopter\" involvement have been used to explain why some cattle appear to have been \"dropped\" from considerable heights.\n\n==Other explanations==\n\n===Aliens and UFOs===\nIn 1974, a few months after the first spate of alleged mutilations in the US, multiple farmers in [[Nebraska]] claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. One claimed he saw an object which \u201clooked as if it had a little bluish-green light on each side with a glow surrounding it.\u201d The sightings were hailed by UFO researchers as the first physical evidence of extraterrestrial life.<ref name=\"JSTOR\">{{cite journal | last = Goleman | first = Michael J. | title = Wave of Mutilation: The Cattle Mutilation Phenomenon of the 1970s. | journal = Agricultural History | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 398\u2013417 | date = 2011 | language = English | jstor = 10.3098/ah.2011.85.3.398 | doi = 10.3098/ah.2011.85.3.398 }}</ref>\n\n===Government Interference===\nAt the same time that UFO reports were being filed with law enforcement and larger number of ranchers claimed to see black helicopters around their fields, coinciding with the cattle mutilations. Although some initially thought these were used by cattle rustlers, suspicion soon pointed toward a military operation running out of [[Fort Riley]], Kansas. Reporter Dane Edwards spread the theory that the government was testing cattle parts to develop biological weapons to use in Vietnam, going so far as to write to [[Floyd K.

Although the original Tandy 1000 came in an IBM PC-like [[desktop case]], some models, notably the 1000 EX and 1000 HX, used [[home computer|home-computer]]-style cases with the keyboard, motherboard and disk drives in one enclosure. This high level of integration made these machines a cost-effective alternative to larger and more complex IBM PC/XT and PC/AT-type systems, which required multiple add-in cards, often purchased separately, to implement a comparable feature-set to the Tandy 1000.\n\nBeing derived from IBM's PCjr architecture, the Tandy 1000 offered several important features that most IBM PC-compatibles of the time lacked, such as the PCjr's sound generator and extended CGA-compatible graphics controller. It also offered multiple built-in I/O ports, including a [[Game port|joystick]] port which was frequently a separate add-on card on non-Tandy machines.\n\nThe original line was equipped with the [[Intel 8088]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which was later extended to faster clock speeds and also the [[Intel 8086|8086]], [[Intel 80286|80286]] and toward the end of the line with the RSX, [[Intel 80386SX|80386SX]] processors. Successors to the 1000 appended two or three letters to the name, after a space (e.g. Tandy 1000 EX and Tandy 1000 HX).  In a few instances, after these letters a slash was appended, followed by either a number or additional letters (e.g. Tandy 1000 TL/2, Tandy 1000 RL/HD).\n\n===Retirement===\nBy 1993, changes in the market made it increasingly difficult for Tandy Corporation to make a profit on its computer line.

The magazine concluded that \"Tandy's machine closely emulates the most basic functions of an IBM PC, and it does so at an affordable price ... along with the security of Tandy's substantial support network\", but wondered if people would buy the 1000 if IBM lowered the price of the PC.<ref name=\"rowell198504\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1985-04/80Microcomputing_0485#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Tandy Rides Again | work=80 Micro | date=April 1985 | accessdate=9 August 2015 | author=Rowell, Dave | pages=50\u201359}}</ref>\n\n''[[InfoWorld]]'' noted the 1000{{'}}s low price (\"fully one-third less than a comparably equipped IBM PC\"), predicted that the computer was really intended for \"the elusive home computer market\", and speculated that \"in retrospect it might have been the PCjr's final straw\". The magazine called the 1000 \"almost as fully IBM PC compatible as a computer can get\", but gave DeskMate a mixed review and advised customers of the computer's inability to use full-length PC expansion cards.

Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> The earlier models of the Tandy 1000 had a composite video output, and could be used with a color or monochrome composite monitor, or a TV with an RF modulator. The original 1000 and SX had a light-pen port. Unlike most PC clones, several Tandy 1000 computers had [[MS-DOS]] built into [[read-only memory|ROM]] and could boot in a few seconds. Tandy bundled [[DeskMate]], a graphical suite of consumer-oriented applications, with various Tandy 1000 models. \n \nEarly Tandy 1000 models used [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix BIOS]]. Common models of the machine included the Tandy 1000, 1000 EX, 1000 HX, 1000 SX, 1000 TX, 1000 SL, 1000 RL, and 1000 TL. With the exception of the RLX and RSX, the Tandy 1000 machines are XT-class machines, which cannot support [[extended memory]] despite some models using 80286 processors. The RLX is an oddity, as it is an XT-class machine that supports 384&nbsp;KB of extended memory, and the RSX is a fully AT-class machine which can support up to 9&nbsp;MB of extended memory.\n\n=== Expansion slots ===\nWith the exception of the 1000 EX and HX, Tandy used industry standard 8-bit XT ISA slots in their desktop models, including the SX, TX, SL, and TL series, but the actual length was limited to 10.5 inches or shorter, rather than the industry standard XT length of 13 inches. 8-bit XT ISA cards had to be shorter than 10.5\" to fit in the 1000's slots. While many 8-bit cards met this length requirement, some cards such as hard cards, EMS memory cards, and multifunction cards that required the standard 13\" length did not fit in the 1000's case. The EX and HX utilized a PLUS-style connector, which was electronically identical to an 8-bit XT ISA slot, but had a 62-pin Berg connector instead of a card edge, rendering it incompatible with ISA cards without an adapter. The PLUS connector was designed for compactness in these models with built-in keyboards. The 1000 RSX featured two 16-bit AT ISA slots.\n\n===Hard disk drives===\nAs hard disk drives at the time of the Tandy 1000's introduction were very expensive, Tandy 1000 systems were not usually equipped with hard drives. However, it was possible to add a hard drive to most Tandy 1000 computers. Most of the desktop-type Tandy 1000 units could accept regular 8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]], [[Run-length limited|RLL]] and [[SCSI]] controllers like typical XT-class machines; however, care had to be taken when configuring the cards so that they did not cause conflicts with the on-board Tandy-designed peripherals.\n\nFor most Tandy 1000 models (other than the compact EX and HX) that did not come already equipped with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options in the form of [[hardcard]]s that were installed in one of the computer's expansion slots and consisted of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5-inch MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a metal bracket. Their own 20 MB hard card was offered for $799, though compatible third-party units were available. Although this arrangement provided a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory meant that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk [[interleaving (disk storage)|interleave]] correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Furthermore, as the Tandy 1000's slots were only 10.5\" long and are 8-bit only, some units would not fit and/or operate correctly unless they were certified to be Tandy-compatible.\n\nStarting with the Tandy 1000 TL/2, XT IDE controllers were integrated onto the motherboard. However, these were incompatible with common AT IDE hard drives. The TL/2, TL/3, RL and RLX all used the XT IDE interface, where the later (and significantly upgraded) RSX was the first and only Tandy 1000 model computer to use a standard [[Integrated Drive Electronics|AT IDE]] interface. One option for contemporary users of these systems would be to install and use XT ISA CompactFlash adapters; this is also the most practical way to install a hard drive into a Tandy 1000 EX or HX, using an adapter cable that adapts the male PLUS-style connector to an 8-bit ISA card-edge slot.\n\n=== I/O and ports ===\nTandy 1000, SX, TX used a proprietary 8-pin round DIN connector for the keyboard port that was compatible with the older TRS computers but not compatible with the IBM PC/AT or PS/2 standard. Some scan codes differed between the Tandy 1000 and IBM PC/XT and AT, resulting in software compatibility issues. The SL/TL and later used a more directly PC/XT-compatible keyboard protocol, and the 1000 RSX used a PC/AT and PS/2-compatible protocol.\n\nTandy 1000 used a proprietary 6-pin female round connector for the joystick port that on the SX/TX was adjacent to the keyboard port in the front of the computer. As with the keyboard, it was compatible with the older TRS-80 and Tandy color computer models, but not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port. Some DOS games do not work with these joystick ports, but those that support Tandy 1000 graphics and sound work.\n\nEarly Tandy 1000 models used a non-standard card-edge parallel printer port rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port. It required a Tandy-1000 compatible printer cable to connect to a standard printer parallel port. This was later changed to a standard DB-25 connector on the 1000 RL.\n\nTandy 1000TX and beyond used a proprietary floppy drive cable port, that also powered the floppy drive. It required a Tandy 1000 compatible floppy drive, though it may be possible to modify a floppy drive cable to make a standard floppy drive work.\n\n=== Operating systems and environments ===\nTandy shipped PCs with their own customized version of [[MS-DOS]], which are compatible with Tandy graphics and keyboard. The most current version of MS-DOS for Tandy 1000 is DOS 3.22. Tandy 1000s came shipped with one of several varieties of [[Deskmate]], their own [[graphical user interface|GUI]] productivity software suite.\n\nThere may be compatibility issues with later versions of DOS such as DOS 5 and DOS 6. Until the 1000 RLX, Tandy 1000s were typically limited to 640&nbsp;KB main memory, and non-Tandy versions of DOS often reduce the memory available for applications and games. In addition, the hardware detection routine for the installer of Microsoft MS-DOS 6 could corrupt the serial EEPROM of Tandy 1000 HX machines.<ref name=dos60ref>ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/dos60.txt</ref>\n\nTandy 1000s could work with [[Windows 1.0]], [[Windows 2.0|2.0]] and [[Windows 3.0|3.0]] but not [[Windows 3.1x|3.1]], with the exception of the RLX which could run Windows 3.1 in Standard mode,<ref name=TVDogPics>http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/RLRLX.html</ref> and the RSX which fully supported running Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced mode.<ref name=TVDogPics />\n\n=== Peripherals ===\n\n==== Monitors ====\nTandy offered 2 color monitors specific for its Tandy 1000 computers: the CM-5, with a 0.64 millimeter dot pitch,<ref>{{cite web|title=CM-5 specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc4/4842.htm|website=radioshacksupport dot com|publisher=Tandy Corporation|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}</ref> and the Tandy CM-11 with a dot pitch of 0.42&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|title=CM-11 specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc6/6012.htm|website=radioshacksupport dot com|publisher=Tandy Corporation|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}</ref> Both were 13 inch displays and had a power cable and a 9 pin RGB cable to attach to the Tandy CGA port. The more expensive CM-11 also supported a special proprietary Tandy enhanced 225 scan line text display mode.\n\nTandy also offered monochrome monitors that support MDA and Hercules standard that also work with Tandy 1000. As it uses a CGA-compatible interface, non-Tandy monitors that support CGA should work.\n\n==== Keyboard ====\nThe original Tandy 1000, SX, EX, TX, HX used a proprietary keyboard and keyboard layout that was not compatible with the PC/XT/AT standard then in use. The layout of the keyboard prefigured the [[IBM Model M]] keyboard introduced with the [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] series, with function keys arranged in a row at the top, instead of on the left as in the PC and PC XT/AT. Later models of the Tandy 1000 series, such as the 1000 SL, TL and RL series used a keyboard more similar and compatible with the IBM PS/2 series keyboard connector and layout.\n\n==== Mouse options ====\nAs the Tandy 1000 used the same game ports as the Tandy Color Computer series, the 26-3025 Color Mouse and 26-3125 Deluxe Mouse were compatible with the Tandy 1000, though not all DOS software and drivers were written to recognize them. The Tandy Digi-Mouse was also available, which required a separate controller that was available in either ISA or PLUS format. Systems with RS-232C serial ports could use standard serial mice, and later systems, such as the 1000 RL, featured a PS/2 mouse connector.\n\n==== Joystick options ====\n\nRadio Shack offered one button joystick that worked with its proprietary  6-pin DIN joystick connector that was compatible with the older [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] but not standard 15-pin IBM PC game ports often found on sound cards and i/o multifunction ISA cards. It worked with many games written to take advantage of Tandy graphics and sound.\n\n==== Modem options ====\n\nRadio Shack offered Tandy 1000 PLUS 300-Baud PC Modem that was compatible with the 1000EX/HX that used PLUS slots. Radio Shack also offered 2400-baud internal modem. Third party modems with speeds of 14k baud should work provided they are 8 bit ISA, and fit.\n\n==== Printers ====\nRadio Shack sold the Tandy DMP-130A dot matrix printers to go along with their Tandy 1000 line, along with compatible card-edged printer cable. This printer was sold at home budget prices. Radio Shack often offered a package bundle with a Tandy 1000 computer, CM-5 budget monitor and DMP-130A printer. Using specially-designed aftermarket cables, it was possible to connect non-Tandy printers to the system.\n\n==== Apple IIe compatibility ====\n \nTandy Radio Shack wanted to compete in the education, school and home market, which was dominated at the time by the [[Apple IIe]].  In 1987, they partnered with Diamond and through Radio Shack sold the [[Diamond Trackstar 128]] series Apple IIe compatibility board for $399, and offered free installation in their Tandy 1000 series. This peripheral was similar to [[Apple IIe Card]] sold later for certain Macintosh models; it was a fully functional Apple IIe clone with 128k ram and 6502 CPU and double high resolution graphics which allowed Tandy 1000 computers to run software written for the Apple IIe and IIc platform, an especially important consideration in the education market of the time. It was also marketed to home users and businesses interested in both MS DOS and Apple II compatibility. \n\nThe board has a pass-through RGB cable and floppy drive cable, and required an open 10 inch 8-bit ISA slot, and used a boot disk to boot into Apple mode. The boot disk has both DOS and Apple software and is [[Copy protection|copy-protected]]. Compatibility was fairly good and allowed Tandy 1000 owners to run most Apple II software on their Tandy 1000 machine for less than the cost of owning  separate IBM PC and Apple II systems.\n\nMany Tandy 1000s sold to schools came with the Diamond Trackstar 128 installed <ref>http://www.applelogic.org/Trackstar.html</ref>, and    home owners also purchased this for compatibility with both DOS and Apple II software <ref>https://www.diskman.com/presents/trackstar/</ref>.\n\n== System specifications ==\n=== Full-size desktop systems ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n![[#Tandy 1000|1000/A]][[#Tandy 1000 HD|/HD]]\n![[#1000 SX|1000 SX]]\n![[#1000 TX|1000 TX]]\n![[#1000 SL and SL/2|1000 SL, SL/2]]\n![[#1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3|1000 TL, TL/2, TL/3]]\n|-\n|Processor\n|Intel 8088 running at 4.7&nbsp;MHz\n|8088 running at 7.16 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|Intel 80286 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n*16-bit memory data path<ref name=TXtechref />\n|Intel 8086 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|\n*TL, TL/2: 80286 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n*TL/3: 80286 running at 10 or 5&nbsp;MHz\n|-\n|RAM\n|128KB minimum;

The floppy drives used jumpers to select the drive number instead of the IBM cable twist. {{nowrap|128 KB}} of memory was standard, with the computer accepting up to {{nowrap|640 KB}} of total memory with the addition of expansion cards.\n\nMS-DOS 2.11, [[DeskMate]] 1.0, and a keyboard with the same layout as the [[Tandy 2000]]'s were included with the computer. Like the PCjr, the Tandy 1000 motherboard did not supply DMA, but unlike that system, it could have DMA added with a memory expansion board.  While the Tandy 1000 had three XT-compatible expansion slots, early Tandy memory upgrade boards took up two of the slots to get to {{nowrap|640 KB}}. Because the slots were {{frac|11|1|2}} inches in length instead of the PC's 13 inches, full-length cards did not fit,{{r|malloy198508}} but reviewers noted that the many built-in hardware features reduced the need for cards.{{r|rosch19851015}}\n\nA later revision of the original Tandy 1000 model was the Tandy 1000A. This revision fixed bugs, scanned expansion cards for bootable ROMs, and added a socket for a math coprocessor.\n\n===Tandy 1000 HD===\nThe original Tandy 1000 (and many other models), like most home computers sold at the time, did not have a hard disk drive.  The Tandy 1000 HD was essentially an original Tandy 1000 with a hard disk option factory installed.  The factory hard disk had a capacity on the order of 10 or 20 MB.\n\n===Tandy 1000 SX and TX===\nThe Tandy 1000 SX and TX were upgraded versions of the original Tandy 1000, utilizing a similar chassis. Two major upgrades over the original Tandy 1000 were the inclusion of a [[Direct memory access|DMA]] controller, which improved the speed of diskette operations and IBM PC-compatibility of these systems, and the addition of two additional ISA expansion slots, to offer a total of five 8-bit ISA slots.\n\n====1000 SX====\n[[File:Tandy 1000 SX with IBM Monitor.jpg|thumb|A Tandy 1000 SX with an IBM Monitor, running ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'']]\nThe Tandy 1000 SX used a 7.16&nbsp;MHz 8088-2 processor, had 384k of memory (upgradeable to 640&nbsp;KB on the motherboard), came with either one or two 5.25\" internal floppy disk drives, and had the light pen port (not a serial port) like the original Tandy 1000. An adjustable potentiometer inside the system controlled the volume of the internal speaker. The Tandy AX was an SX rebadged for sale in [[Walmart]] stores. The 1000 SX came with MS-DOS 3.2 and Deskmate II on 5.25\" 360kB diskettes.\n\nThe SX was the first Tandy 1000 in which the built-in video circuitry could be disabled via [[DIP switch]]. This was to permit the installation of an upgraded graphics card, typically an [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] or [[Video Graphics Array|VGA card]], in an expansion slot.\n\n====1000 TX====\nThe Tandy 1000 TX was similar to the 1000 SX with its detached keyboard, unique parallel port edge connector and XT-style architecture in a slightly modified case. The major difference was the 80286 CPU clocked at 8&nbsp;MHz. Similar to the [[IBM XT 286]], it featured a 16-bit-wide memory bus, although the on-board peripherals and ISA slots were 8 bits wide.<ref name=TXtechref>ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/txtech.zip</ref>\n\nThe TX had a 3.5\" internal floppy disk drive mounted in a 5.25\" bay with room for an optional second internal 3.5\" or 5.25\" floppy disk drive. The rear panel had the same ports as the 1000 SX, except that an RS-232C serial port replaced the light-pen port. The memory size was 640 KB, with sockets for an additional 128 KB devoted to the onboard video logic. This extra 128&nbsp;KB could only be used for and by the on-board video controller, so it was impractical to expand the on-board memory beyond 640&nbsp;KB if a VGA graphics card was installed. The computer came bundled with Personal DeskMate 2.\n\n===Tandy 1000 EX and HX===\nThe Tandy 1000 EX and HX were designed as entry-level IBM-compatible personal computers, and marketed as starter systems for people new to computing. They were offered in a compact, all-in-one chassis that featured a 7.16&nbsp;MHz 8088 (capable of clocking down to 4.77&nbsp;MHz), 256&nbsp;KB of memory (expandable to 640&nbsp;KB with a PLUS memory expansion board), PCjr- and CGA-compatible Tandy Video graphics controller, a keyboard and, depending on the model, either a single 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB floppy drive, or one to two 3.5\" 720&nbsp;KB floppy drives. An external floppy drive could be connected to a port on the back. The machine itself supplied power to the external drive, so only Tandy's unit was usable with the EX and HX. The external drive was the standard 360&nbsp;KB 5.25 inch format; in 1988 a compatible 720&nbsp;KB 3.5 inch model was offered.\n\nThe EX and HX are upgradable via Tandy PLUS cards, and these systems have bays for three cards. A PLUS card connector is electrically identical to an ISA slot connector, but uses a [[Berg connector|Berg-style]] 62-pin connector instead of a 62-contact ISA card-edge connector. Other PLUS cards could be installed to add serial ports, a 1200-baud modem, a clock/calendar and bus mouse board, or a proprietary Tandy network interface. Radio Shack later sold an adapter card allowing installation of a PLUS card into a standard ISA slot, such as those in the larger Tandy 1000 models.\n\nLike the original Tandy 1000, the EX and HX do not have a built-in DMA controller, though one can be added using the PLUS memory expansion board.\n\n====1000 EX====\nThe Tandy 1000 EX featured a 5.25\" floppy drive built into the right-hand side of computer casing. The EX sold for US$1,000.00 from Radio Shack in December 1986. The EX and, later, the HX would be among the most popular of the Tandy 1000 line because of their (relatively) low price.\n\nA useful feature for the EX and later systems was the ability to boot off either drive, as the drives could be logically swapped when the system booted, so that the drive that was normally drive B: became drive A:, and vice versa, and the drives remained swapped until the system was powered off or reset.  (The SX and TX have this capability as well.)\n\nThe 1000 EX came with MS-DOS 2.11 and Personal Deskmate on 5.25\" 360kB diskettes. The MS-DOS was a version specialized for and only bootable on the Tandy 1000; it included a version of BASICA (Microsoft's Advanced GW-BASIC) with support for the enhanced CGA graphics modes (a.k.a. Tandy Graphics or TGA) and three-voice sound hardware of the Tandy 1000.\n\n====1000 HX====\n[[Image:Tandy1000HX tweaked.jpg|thumbnail|right|285px|A Tandy 1000 HX, with a Tandy RGB monitor, an external 5.25-inch disk drive, joystick, and a Tandy DMP-133 [[dot matrix]] [[Computer printer|printer]]]]\nThe Tandy 1000 HX was an updated version of the EX. It utilized the same architecture and PLUS cards as the EX; however, one obvious difference was that it offered two 3.5\" bays on the front panel, occupied by one or two 720 KB 3.5\" floppy drives, as opposed to a single side-mounted 5.25\" bay and floppy drive with the EX. It also had [[Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R]] in ROM, which could be accessed by starting the computer with no bootable disk present. Another improvement over the EX is the addition of a serial EEPROM to store configuration information, enabling similar functionality to today's CMOS NVRAMs. By comparison, earlier Tandy 1000 models, like IBM PC and PC/XT systems, used DIP switches and jumpers for startup configuration settings.\n\nBy putting the basic elements of DOS and Deskmate in ROM and eliminating the memory test on startup, the HX booted quickly compared to other contemporary MS-DOS machines, despite having no immediate provisions for a hard disk drive.\n\nIn addition to Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R, the HX shipped with Personal Deskmate 2. Most versions of MS-DOS worked with the 1000 HX, including DOS 3.x, and some later versions. There was, however, a quirk in the DOS 4.0 environment that prevented that version of DOS from working with Tandy 1000 HX computers. Additionally, the installer for MS-DOS 6 could corrupt the contents of the serial EEPROM.<ref name=dos60ref />\n\n===Tandy 1000 SL and TL series===\nThe Tandy SL and TL series of computers were updates of the SX and TX, respectively. In addition to offering redesigned cases, the machines offered a more integrated motherboard with improved graphics and sound capabilities while dropping composite video output. The graphics controller now supported {{nowrap|640 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 16}} resolution as well as a [[Hercules Graphics Card]]-compatible, {{nowrap|720 \u00d7 350}} mode for monochrome monitors. Sound capabilities now included an 8-bit monaural DAC/ADC, which was similar in function to [[parallel port]] sound devices (such as the [[Covox Speech Thing]] and [[Disney Sound Source]]) but was extended to support DMA transfers, microphone input capability, and sampling rates up to 48&nbsp;kHz. The SL/TL lines allowed the on-board floppy controller, parallel port and serial ports to be disabled, which the earlier models did not.\n\nThe SL and TL were also shipped with MS-DOS 3.3 and [[DeskMate]] 3 in ROM, and featured a serial [[EEPROM]] memory chip to store BIOS settings. The machines could also run 'normal' MS-DOS 3.x, 5.x, and 6.x and Windows 2.x and 3.0 operating systems, although Windows was limited to real-mode operations. In common with many PC clones of the era, MS-DOS 4 was problematic and generally avoided.\n\n====1000 SL and SL/2====\n[[File:SL Sound Satellite.JPG|thumb|right|The SL's sound/reset satellite board]]\nThe Tandy 1000 SL and SL/2 feature an [[Intel 8086]] processor running at 8&nbsp;MHz. This is socketed, and thus upgradeable with an [[NEC V30]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits and Drawbacks of the Late Model Tandy 1000s, CPU Upgradability |url=http://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/search?q=tandy+sl%2F2 |website=Nerdly Pleasures |publisher=Great Hierophant |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> The SL came with {{nowrap|384 KB}} of RAM preinstalled, whereas the SL/2 offered {{nowrap|512 KB}}. Both machines could be expanded to {{nowrap|640 KB}}, although the graphics controller reserved a portion of this memory, yielding only {{nowrap|608 KB}} available the operating system, even on systems using add-in ISA graphic cards. The SL line had the mic/earphone ports, volume knob and reset button on a small satellite board. A jumper on the board allowed the user to change the microphone input to a line-level output.<ref name=\"radioshacksupport\">{{cite book | url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc1/1262.htm | title=Tandy faxback document #1262 | accessdate=September 6, 2014 | date=1995-04-26 }}</ref> The SL series offered five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, and did not come with pre-installed [[real-time clock]] chips, making them optional upgrades in the form of the plug-in Dallas DS1216E SmartWatch.\n\nThe SL is the only machine in the line that offers an upper 5.25\" bay, and therefore the only model to offer two 5.25\" bays, where the other models, including the SL/2 and the entire TL range, feature two upper 3.5\" bays and one lower 5.25\" bay. As a result, fitting a hard drive to an SL that already has the upper and lower 5.25\" bays populated may require either the removal of one of the devices in those bays, or the installation of a hard disk card-style bracket which seats in one of the ISA slots.\n\n====1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3====\nThe Tandy 1000 TL and TL/2 used 8&nbsp;MHz Intel 80286 processors, whereas the TL/3 used a 10&nbsp;MHz 80286. The TLs had 640&nbsp;KB of memory preinstalled, with an option for an extra 128&nbsp;KB for video frame buffering just as in the 1000 TX. Unlike the SL series machines, the TL machines came with the SmartWatch real-time clock logic built-in, which was powered by a removable 3-volt CR2032 button-cell battery on the motherboard.\n\nThe TL offered five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, while the TL/2 and TL/3 offered four slots and an on-board 8-bit, XT IDE-compatible hard disk interface, which was not compatible with standard AT IDE hard drives. The TL series offered two upper 3.5\" bays and one lower 5.25\" bay. The TL/3 also offered a high-density floppy drive controller for 1.44 MB drives, though it shipped with a double-density 3.5\" 720 KB drive.\n\nAs the processors on the TL-series are socketed, it is possible to install 386SX or Cyrix 486SLC-based processor upgrades, though the benefit of installing more advanced processors is limited beyond merely providing a speed increase due to the computers' XT-based architecture, and their resulting inability to access [[extended memory]] above 1 MB.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits and Drawbacks of the Late Model Tandy 1000s, CPU Upgradability |url=http://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/search?q=tandy+sl%2F2 |website=Nerdly Pleasures |publisher=Great Hierophant |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Tandy 1000 RL-series and RSX===\n[[File:Tandy 1000 rl 1.jpg|left|thumb|A Tandy 1000 RL running DeskMate (optional mouse not shown)]]\nThe Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX series were slim-line desktop home computers. They featured a much more compact case, with at least 512&nbsp;KB of memory pre-installed, smaller [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]]-style keyboard and mouse ports, and at least one ISA expansion slot. The RL-series and RSX include provisions for an internal hard disk drive, depending on the model: the RL-series featured a built-in [[Industry Standard Architecture#XT-IDE|XT-IDE]] hard drive interface, while the RSX featured an AT-compatible [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] interface. The keyboard connectors of the RL-series, while similar to and mechanically compatible with PS/2-style connectors, were not fully compatible with typical PS/2 keyboards, as the keyboard uses the XT keyboard protocol. The RSX, however, incorporated the AT keyboard protocol, making it the first 1000-series system to offer more complete compatibility with typical PS/2 keyboards, and AT keyboards using an adapter.\n\n====1000 RL and RL/HD====\nThe RL and RL/HD featured a surface-mounted {{nowrap|9.54 MHz}} 8086 processor, 512&nbsp;KB of RAM (expandable to 768&nbsp;KB to provide 128&nbsp;KB for video and 640&nbsp;KB conventional memory), a DB-25 unidirectional parallel port instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL's enhanced graphics and sound. A single half-size 8-bit expansion slot was available. The RL/HD had a battery-backed real-time clock chip to store date and time information, which the RL lacked. These models also had MS-DOS and a portion of DeskMate in ROM, and could therefore boot much faster than many other computers on the market. The RL/HD came with a 20MB drive preinstalled.\n\n====1000 RLX====\nThe RLX was the 'mid-range' offering of the RL line. It had a 10&nbsp;MHz 286 (surface-mounted) and 512 KB of RAM, and unlike other 286-based Tandy 1000 models, it supported 384&nbsp;KB of extended memory when RAM was expanded to the maximum 1 MB. However, it was not a full AT-class machine, as it still had an 8-bit ISA bus (as with the RL, one half-size expansion slot) and only 8 IRQs and 4 DMA channels. While the three-voice sound chip and DAC were still present, Tandy video was dropped in favor of an AcuMos [[VGA]] controller offering 256 kB of video memory and standard VGA graphics resolutions. The parallel port was bidirectional, a first for the Tandy 1000 series. The RLX had one 1.44 MB 3.5\" floppy drive; an empty drive bay could host a second such drive. The hard disk RLX/HD came with a 20&nbsp;MB hard disk and 1 MB RAM preinstalled. The hard disk occupied the empty drive bay, so this version supported only a single floppy drive.\n\n====1000 RSX====\nA more upscale offering, the RSX offered a 25&nbsp;MHz 80386SX processor, 1 MB RAM, two 16-bit ISA slots, AcuMos SVGA video, a bidirectional parallel port, and standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. It was a full 386-class PC and could run Microsoft Windows 3.x. Two sockets for SIMM memory cards were provided. Only 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs of the 9-chip type were supported, and if two were installed they had to be of like capacity. With two 4 MB SIMMs installed, the 1000 RSX could be expanded to 9 MB RAM (without using an ISA slot). The RSX/HD variant came with a 52 MB hard drive using an AT-compatible IDE interface; replacement hard drives up to 504 MB could be substituted. Because of the slimline case, only one hard drive could be installed alongside the 1.44 MB 3.5\" floppy drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 1000 RSX specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc1/1332.htm|website=Radio Shack Support|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 1000 Rl/RLX Pictures|url=http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/RLRLX.html|website=Oldskool.org|publisher=TV Dog|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe motherboard had a socket for the 80387SX math coprocessor. The RSX still retained the Tandy 1000 3-voice sound hardware and DAC, though the I/O address for the 3-voice sound chip was moved, rendering many games previously compatible with it unable to play music unless modified. The DAC could be used to emulate the Covox Speech Thing via MS-DOS device drivers for limited sound support. This worked with the game ''Chuck Yeager's Air Combat''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/chuck-yeagers-air-combat/techinfo|title=Chuck Yeager's Air Combat for DOS (1991) Tech Info|website=MobyGames|access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n\nWindows 3.xx sound device drivers were available that worked in Windows 95 (with full 9MB RAM) on Tandy 1000 RSX.\nThe ACUMOS VGA graphics could be software-updated with Cirrus Logic BIOS (via MS-DOS driver) to allow VESA/SVGA to function in Windows 95, as the Windows 3.xx Tandy VGA drivers were insufficient for Windows 95.\n\n==Selected Tandy 1000-enhanced software==\n\nMajor software publishers and makers of game and educational software, such as [[Sierra On-line|Sierra]] and [[Broderbund]], offered software titles that specifically supported Tandy's unique and proprietary 16-color graphics, 3-voice sound, and other Tandy specific hardware features. These enhancements offer a superior graphics and sound experience for Tandy 1000 owners over standard DOS titles. Software that supported Tandy's graphics were typically labelled on the package as Tandy 1000/PCjr compatible. Many Tandy 1000 enhanced games are featured on YouTube.\n\nAlthough the Tandy 1000 can run most DOS software, the below programs are known to specifically support Tandy 1000 enhanced features. These programs require DOS to run. Tandy shipped its own version of DOS. Tandy used the main memory for graphics, as a result most programs require 640k or 768k to run. The enhanced graphics and sound often tax the processor, so an 80286 processor or faster is recommended for best results.\n\nThere are also games and educational software that supports second generation Tandy 1000 graphics and sound, which offers 640 by 200 by 16 colors, and 8-bit DACs, found only on the 1000 sl/tl series. Examples of such software includes Mario's Typing Tutor, Star Trek, Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist, Sargon Chess.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''[[Arkanoid]]''\n*''[[Rastan (video game)|Rastan]]''\n*''[[Operation Wolf]]''\n*''[[LHX Attack Chopper]]''\n*''[[Thexder]]'' 1 and 2\n*''[[The Black Cauldron (video game)|The Black Cauldron]]''\n*''[[King's Quest]]'' 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n*''[[Space Quest]]'' 1, 2, and 3\n*''[[Police Quest]]''\n*''[[Silpheed]]''\n*''[[Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist]]''\n*''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]''\n*''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]''\n*''[[Mario Teaches Typing]]''\n*''[[Sargon (chess)|Sargon]]''\n*''[[Out Run]]''\n*''[[Choplifter]]''\n*''[[Reader Rabbit]]''\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES video game)#Ports|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''\n*''[[Skate or Die]]''\n*''[[Zeliard]]''\n*''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]''\n*''[[Shogun (video game)|Shogun]]''\n*''[[Alley Cat (video game)|Alley Cat]]''\n*''[[Digger (video game)|Digger]]''\n*''[[A-10 Tank Killer]]''\n*''[[Defender of the Crown]]''\n*''[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]''\n*''[[Caveman Ugh-Lympics]]''\n*''Darwin's Arena'' (a shareware game)\n*''[[The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing]]''\n*''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Sky]]''\n*''[[Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040826174904/http://support.radioshack.com/productinfo/ProductResults.asp?Name=Tandy_Desktops&ID=001001001 Radio Shack Tandy Computer Support], the official support site for Tandy Computers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070811034841/http://support.radioshack.com/productinfo/ product search page])\n* [http://www.oldskool.org/pc/tand-em/ The Tand-Em Project], a Tandy 1000 emulator project\n* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/ DOSBox] MS-DOS, Tandy 1000, PCjr Emulator\n* [http://www.mess.org/ MESS] Multiple emulator with Tandy 1000HX support\n* [http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/ Tvdog's Archive], Major archive of Tandy 1000 programs and documentation\n* [http://www.brooksdeforest.com/tandy1000/ Tandy 1000 BASIC Programs], Games and applications\n* [http://www.oldskool.org/shrines/pcjr_tandy The OldSkool Shrine], Tandy 1000 History And Memories\n* [http://r.webring.com/hub?ring=tandy1000 Tandy 1000 Webring], More Sites On The Tandy 1000\n* [http://lowendmac.com/2015/tandys-pc-compatible-computers/ Low End Mac's retrospective] on the Tandy 2000 computer and Tandy 1000 series (Daniel Knight - 2015-12-19)\n* {{YouTube |id = mYHtojsaRkY |title = The Tandy 1000 - The best MS-DOS computer in 1984. }}\n\n{{TRS-80 and Tandy computers}}\n\n[[Category:Home computers]]\n[[Category:RadioShack]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1984]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1984]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox information appliance\n| name = Tandy 1000\n| title = \n| aka = \n| logo = \n| image = Sabu with his Tandy 1000 Computer.jpg\n| caption = A cat resting on a Tandy 1000 EX computer\n| developer = \n| manufacturer = \n| family = \n| type = [[Personal computer]]\n| generation = \n| releasedate = {{Start date and age|1984|11}}<ref name=\"infoworld19850121\">{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9y4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23&dq=%22tandy+1000%22#v=onepage&q=%22tandy%201000%22&f=false | title=BRIEFS | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | date=1985-02-12 | magazine=InfoWorld | pages=23}}</ref>\n| lifespan = \n| price = {{USD|1200|1984}}\n| discontinued = 1993\n| unitssold = \n| unitsshipped = \n| media = \n| os = \n| power = \n| soc = \n| cpu = \n| memory = \n| storage = \n| memory card = \n| display = \n| graphics = \n| sound = \n| input = \n| controllers = \n| camera = \n| touchpad = \n| connectivity = \n| platform = \n| service = \n| dimensions = \n| weight = \n| topgame = \n| compatibility = \n| predecessor = \n| successor = \n| related = \n| website = <!--{{URL|example.org}}-->\n}}\nThe '''Tandy 1000''' was the first in a line of [[IBM PC compatible]] [[home computer]] systems produced by the [[Tandy Corporation]] for sale in its [[RadioShack|Radio Shack]] and Radio Shack Computer Center chains of stores.\n\n==Overview==\nIn December 1983 an executive with [[Tandy Corporation]], maker of [[TRS-80]] computers, said about the new [[IBM PCjr]]: \"I'm sure a lot of people will be coming out with PCjr look-alikes.

With its graphics, sound, and built-in joystick ports, the 1000 was the best computer for [[PC game]]s until [[VGA graphics]] became popular in the 1990s.<ref name=\"loguidice2014\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZnpAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA97&ots=if3RT7GQLq&pg=PA96#v=onepage&f=false | title=Vintage Game Consoles: An Inside Look at Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and the Greatest Gaming Platforms of All Time | publisher=CRC Press |author1=Loguidice, Bill |author2=Barton, Matt | year=2014 | pages=96\u201397 | isbn=1135006512}}</ref> Software companies of the era advertised their support for the Tandy platform;<ref name=\"compute198806\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-JUn-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_097_1988_JUn#page/n23/mode/2up | title=Electrifying Software For Today's PC | work=Compute! | date=June 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | pages=23 | type=advertisement}}</ref> 28 of 66 games that ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' tested in 1989 supported Tandy graphics.<ref name=\"cgw198908\">{{cite news | title=The Owner's Guide to Tandy 16 Color | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1989 | pages=14}}</ref>\n\n===Design and architecture===\nTandy 1000 computers were some of the first IBM PC clones to incorporate a complete set of basic peripherals on the motherboard using proprietary [[ASIC]]s, the forerunner of the [[chipset]]. Although the original Tandy 1000 came in an IBM PC-like [[desktop case]], some models, notably the 1000 EX and 1000 HX, used [[home computer|home-computer]]-style cases with the keyboard, motherboard and disk drives in one enclosure. This high level of integration made these machines a cost-effective alternative to larger and more complex IBM PC/XT and PC/AT-type systems, which required multiple add-in cards, often purchased separately, to implement a comparable feature-set to the Tandy 1000.\n\nBeing derived from IBM's PCjr architecture, the Tandy 1000 offered several important features that most IBM PC-compatibles of the time lacked, such as the PCjr's sound generator and extended CGA-compatible graphics controller. It also offered multiple built-in I/O ports, including a [[Game port|joystick]] port which was frequently a separate add-on card on non-Tandy machines.\n\nThe original line was equipped with the [[Intel 8088]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which was later extended to faster clock speeds and also the [[Intel 8086|8086]], [[Intel 80286|80286]] and toward the end of the line with the RSX, [[Intel 80386SX|80386SX]] processors. Successors to the 1000 appended two or three letters to the name, after a space (e.g. Tandy 1000 EX and Tandy 1000 HX).  In a few instances, after these letters a slash was appended, followed by either a number or additional letters (e.g. Tandy 1000 TL/2, Tandy 1000 RL/HD).\n\n===Retirement===\nBy 1993, changes in the market made it increasingly difficult for Tandy Corporation to make a profit on its computer line. Tandy Corporation sold its computer manufacturing business to [[AST Computers]], and all Tandy computer lines were terminated. Radio Shack stores then began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as [[IBM]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Radio+Shack+adds+hot+new+IBM+Aptiva+MPC+to+name-brand+computer+line.-a015914929|accessdate=May 16, 2017|date=Nov 9, 1994|via=Business Wire|title=Radio Shack adds hot new IBM Aptiva MPC to name-brand computer line.}}</ref> and [[Compaq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corpinfo.radioshack.com/investor/annualreports/97/ops_computers.htm |title=Radio Shack Computers - 1997 Annual Report |publisher=RadioShack.com |date=1997 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212025433/http://corpinfo.radioshack.com/investor/annualreports/97/ops_computers.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn an article subtitled \"Junior meets his match\", [[John J. Anderson]] of ''[[Creative Computing]]'' called the original Tandy 1000 \"the machine IBM was too inept, incapable, or afraid to manufacture. It is sure to put a whopping dent not only into PCjr sales, but into sales of the PC 'senior' as well\". He favorably mentioned its low price, good PC-software compatibility, and bundled DeskMate (\"you might never need another software package for your computer\").{{r|anderson198412}} ''[[80 Micro]]'' approved of the 1000{{'}}s PC compatibility and stated that the exterior design \"gives it a feeling of quality and confidence\". The magazine concluded that \"Tandy's machine closely emulates the most basic functions of an IBM PC, and it does so at an affordable price ... along with the security of Tandy's substantial support network\", but wondered if people would buy the 1000 if IBM lowered the price of the PC.<ref name=\"rowell198504\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1985-04/80Microcomputing_0485#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Tandy Rides Again | work=80 Micro | date=April 1985 | accessdate=9 August 2015 | author=Rowell, Dave | pages=50\u201359}}</ref>\n\n''[[InfoWorld]]'' noted the 1000{{'}}s low price (\"fully one-third less than a comparably equipped IBM PC\"), predicted that the computer was really intended for \"the elusive home computer market\", and speculated that \"in retrospect it might have been the PCjr's final straw\". The magazine called the 1000 \"almost as fully IBM PC compatible as a computer can get\", but gave DeskMate a mixed review and advised customers of the computer's inability to use full-length PC expansion cards. It concluded that \"By making the 1000 inexpensive and adaptable\" and including DeskMate, \"Tandy produced a real home computer\".<ref name=\"springer19850603\"/>\n\n''[[BYTE]]'' called the 1000 \"a good, reasonably priced IBM PC clone that has most of the best features of the IBM PC and PCjr ... at current prices it is a very good alternative\". It noted the high level of software compatibility and the good keyboard, and stated that DeskMate was \"fairly good ... but a little extra programming work could have turned [it] into a much better program\", noting that\u2014for example\u2014the word processor did not have a Move command. The magazine also mentioned the computer's short slots.<ref name=\"malloy198508\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-08/1985_08_BYTE_10-08_Declarative_Languages#page/n273/mode/2up | title=The Tandy 1000 | work=BYTE | date=August 1985 | accessdate=27 October 2013 | author=Malloy, Rich | pages=266 | type=review}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' also noted the slots and criticized the Tandy 1000's fit and finish, but acknowledged the computer's low price and bundled hardware features.<ref name=\"rosch19851015\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wcv9oIHOrjQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Cost-Conscious Computing | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-10-15 | accessdate=29 October 2013 | author=Rosch, Winn L. | pages=113}}</ref>\n\n==Technical details==\nAll Tandy 1000 computers featured built-in video hardware, enhanced sound hardware (based on one of several variants of the Texas Instruments [[Texas Instruments SN76489|SN76496]] sound generator) and numerous peripheral interfaces, including game ports compatible with those on the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], an IBM-standard floppy-disk controller supporting two drives, and a parallel printer port, all integrated into the motherboard in addition to the hardware standard on the IBM PC/XT and, in later Tandy 1000 models, PC/AT motherboards.\n\nFor the original Tandy 1000, the designers omitted a DMA controller because the PCjr does not have one, and they believed that those who needed it would add it with additional memory for the computer; they omitted the [[RS-232]] port because all Tandy printers use the parallel port and, they believed, most customers would use internal modems.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> The earlier models of the Tandy 1000 had a composite video output, and could be used with a color or monochrome composite monitor, or a TV with an RF modulator. The original 1000 and SX had a light-pen port. Unlike most PC clones, several Tandy 1000 computers had [[MS-DOS]] built into [[read-only memory|ROM]] and could boot in a few seconds. Tandy bundled [[DeskMate]], a graphical suite of consumer-oriented applications, with various Tandy 1000 models. \n \nEarly Tandy 1000 models used [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix BIOS]]. Common models of the machine included the Tandy 1000, 1000 EX, 1000 HX, 1000 SX, 1000 TX, 1000 SL, 1000 RL, and 1000 TL. With the exception of the RLX and RSX, the Tandy 1000 machines are XT-class machines, which cannot support [[extended memory]] despite some models using 80286 processors. The RLX is an oddity, as it is an XT-class machine that supports 384&nbsp;KB of extended memory, and the RSX is a fully AT-class machine which can support up to 9&nbsp;MB of extended memory.\n\n=== Expansion slots ===\nWith the exception of the 1000 EX and HX, Tandy used industry standard 8-bit XT ISA slots in their desktop models, including the SX, TX, SL, and TL series, but the actual length was limited to 10.5 inches or shorter, rather than the industry standard XT length of 13 inches. 8-bit XT ISA cards had to be shorter than 10.5\" to fit in the 1000's slots. While many 8-bit cards met this length requirement, some cards such as hard cards, EMS memory cards, and multifunction cards that required the standard 13\" length did not fit in the 1000's case. The EX and HX utilized a PLUS-style connector, which was electronically identical to an 8-bit XT ISA slot, but had a 62-pin Berg connector instead of a card edge, rendering it incompatible with ISA cards without an adapter. The PLUS connector was designed for compactness in these models with built-in keyboards. The 1000 RSX featured two 16-bit AT ISA slots.\n\n===Hard disk drives===\nAs hard disk drives at the time of the Tandy 1000's introduction were very expensive, Tandy 1000 systems were not usually equipped with hard drives. However, it was possible to add a hard drive to most Tandy 1000 computers. Most of the desktop-type Tandy 1000 units could accept regular 8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]], [[Run-length limited|RLL]] and [[SCSI]] controllers like typical XT-class machines; however, care had to be taken when configuring the cards so that they did not cause conflicts with the on-board Tandy-designed peripherals.\n\nFor most Tandy 1000 models (other than the compact EX and HX) that did not come already equipped with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options in the form of [[hardcard]]s that were installed in one of the computer's expansion slots and consisted of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5-inch MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a metal bracket. Their own 20 MB hard card was offered for $799, though compatible third-party units were available. Although this arrangement provided a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory meant that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk [[interleaving (disk storage)|interleave]] correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Furthermore, as the Tandy 1000's slots were only 10.5\" long and are 8-bit only, some units would not fit and/or operate correctly unless they were certified to be Tandy-compatible.\n\nStarting with the Tandy 1000 TL/2, XT IDE controllers were integrated onto the motherboard. However, these were incompatible with common AT IDE hard drives. The TL/2, TL/3, RL and RLX all used the XT IDE interface, where the later (and significantly upgraded) RSX was the first and only Tandy 1000 model computer to use a standard [[Integrated Drive Electronics|AT IDE]] interface. One option for contemporary users of these systems would be to install and use XT ISA CompactFlash adapters; this is also the most practical way to install a hard drive into a Tandy 1000 EX or HX, using an adapter cable that adapts the male PLUS-style connector to an 8-bit ISA card-edge slot.\n\n=== I/O and ports ===\nTandy 1000, SX, TX used a proprietary 8-pin round DIN connector for the keyboard port that was compatible with the older TRS computers but not compatible with the IBM PC/AT or PS/2 standard. Some scan codes differed between the Tandy 1000 and IBM PC/XT and AT, resulting in software compatibility issues. The SL/TL and later used a more directly PC/XT-compatible keyboard protocol, and the 1000 RSX used a PC/AT and PS/2-compatible protocol.\n\nTandy 1000 used a proprietary 6-pin female round connector for the joystick port that on the SX/TX was adjacent to the keyboard port in the front of the computer. As with the keyboard, it was compatible with the older TRS-80 and Tandy color computer models, but not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port. Some DOS games do not work with these joystick ports, but those that support Tandy 1000 graphics and sound work.\n\nEarly Tandy 1000 models used a non-standard card-edge parallel printer port rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port. It required a Tandy-1000 compatible printer cable to connect to a standard printer parallel port. This was later changed to a standard DB-25 connector on the 1000 RL.\n\nTandy 1000TX and beyond used a proprietary floppy drive cable port, that also powered the floppy drive. It required a Tandy 1000 compatible floppy drive, though it may be possible to modify a floppy drive cable to make a standard floppy drive work.\n\n=== Operating systems and environments ===\nTandy shipped PCs with their own customized version of [[MS-DOS]], which are compatible with Tandy graphics and keyboard. The most current version of MS-DOS for Tandy 1000 is DOS 3.22. Tandy 1000s came shipped with one of several varieties of [[Deskmate]], their own [[graphical user interface|GUI]] productivity software suite.\n\nThere may be compatibility issues with later versions of DOS such as DOS 5 and DOS 6. Until the 1000 RLX, Tandy 1000s were typically limited to 640&nbsp;KB main memory, and non-Tandy versions of DOS often reduce the memory available for applications and games. In addition, the hardware detection routine for the installer of Microsoft MS-DOS 6 could corrupt the serial EEPROM of Tandy 1000 HX machines.<ref name=dos60ref>ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/dos60.txt</ref>\n\nTandy 1000s could work with [[Windows 1.0]], [[Windows 2.0|2.0]] and [[Windows 3.0|3.0]] but not [[Windows 3.1x|3.1]], with the exception of the RLX which could run Windows 3.1 in Standard mode,<ref name=TVDogPics>http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/RLRLX.html</ref> and the RSX which fully supported running Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced mode.<ref name=TVDogPics />\n\n=== Peripherals ===\n\n==== Monitors ====\nTandy offered 2 color monitors specific for its Tandy 1000 computers: the CM-5, with a 0.64 millimeter dot pitch,<ref>{{cite web|title=CM-5 specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc4/4842.htm|website=radioshacksupport dot com|publisher=Tandy Corporation|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}</ref> and the Tandy CM-11 with a dot pitch of 0.42&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|title=CM-11 specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc6/6012.htm|website=radioshacksupport dot com|publisher=Tandy Corporation|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}</ref> Both were 13 inch displays and had a power cable and a 9 pin RGB cable to attach to the Tandy CGA port. The more expensive CM-11 also supported a special proprietary Tandy enhanced 225 scan line text display mode.\n\nTandy also offered monochrome monitors that support MDA and Hercules standard that also work with Tandy 1000. As it uses a CGA-compatible interface, non-Tandy monitors that support CGA should work.\n\n==== Keyboard ====\nThe original Tandy 1000, SX, EX, TX, HX used a proprietary keyboard and keyboard layout that was not compatible with the PC/XT/AT standard then in use. The layout of the keyboard prefigured the [[IBM Model M]] keyboard introduced with the [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] series, with function keys arranged in a row at the top, instead of on the left as in the PC and PC XT/AT. Later models of the Tandy 1000 series, such as the 1000 SL, TL and RL series used a keyboard more similar and compatible with the IBM PS/2 series keyboard connector and layout.\n\n==== Mouse options ====\nAs the Tandy 1000 used the same game ports as the Tandy Color Computer series, the 26-3025 Color Mouse and 26-3125 Deluxe Mouse were compatible with the Tandy 1000, though not all DOS software and drivers were written to recognize them. The Tandy Digi-Mouse was also available, which required a separate controller that was available in either ISA or PLUS format. Systems with RS-232C serial ports could use standard serial mice, and later systems, such as the 1000 RL, featured a PS/2 mouse connector.\n\n==== Joystick options ====\n\nRadio Shack offered one button joystick that worked with its proprietary  6-pin DIN joystick connector that was compatible with the older [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] but not standard 15-pin IBM PC game ports often found on sound cards and i/o multifunction ISA cards. It worked with many games written to take advantage of Tandy graphics and sound.\n\n==== Modem options ====\n\nRadio Shack offered Tandy 1000 PLUS 300-Baud PC Modem that was compatible with the 1000EX/HX that used PLUS slots. Radio Shack also offered 2400-baud internal modem. Third party modems with speeds of 14k baud should work provided they are 8 bit ISA, and fit.\n\n==== Printers ====\nRadio Shack sold the Tandy DMP-130A dot matrix printers to go along with their Tandy 1000 line, along with compatible card-edged printer cable. This printer was sold at home budget prices. Radio Shack often offered a package bundle with a Tandy 1000 computer, CM-5 budget monitor and DMP-130A printer. Using specially-designed aftermarket cables, it was possible to connect non-Tandy printers to the system.\n\n==== Apple IIe compatibility ====\n \nTandy Radio Shack wanted to compete in the education, school and home market, which was dominated at the time by the [[Apple IIe]].  In 1987, they partnered with Diamond and through Radio Shack sold the [[Diamond Trackstar 128]] series Apple IIe compatibility board for $399, and offered free installation in their Tandy 1000 series. This peripheral was similar to [[Apple IIe Card]] sold later for certain Macintosh models; it was a fully functional Apple IIe clone with 128k ram and 6502 CPU and double high resolution graphics which allowed Tandy 1000 computers to run software written for the Apple IIe and IIc platform, an especially important consideration in the education market of the time. It was also marketed to home users and businesses interested in both MS DOS and Apple II compatibility. \n\nThe board has a pass-through RGB cable and floppy drive cable, and required an open 10 inch 8-bit ISA slot, and used a boot disk to boot into Apple mode. The boot disk has both DOS and Apple software and is [[Copy protection|copy-protected]]. Compatibility was fairly good and allowed Tandy 1000 owners to run most Apple II software on their Tandy 1000 machine for less than the cost of owning  separate IBM PC and Apple II systems.\n\nMany Tandy 1000s sold to schools came with the Diamond Trackstar 128 installed <ref>http://www.applelogic.org/Trackstar.html</ref>, and    home owners also purchased this for compatibility with both DOS and Apple II software <ref>https://www.diskman.com/presents/trackstar/</ref>.\n\n== System specifications ==\n=== Full-size desktop systems ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n![[#Tandy 1000|1000/A]][[#Tandy 1000 HD|/HD]]\n![[#1000 SX|1000 SX]]\n![[#1000 TX|1000 TX]]\n![[#1000 SL and SL/2|1000 SL, SL/2]]\n![[#1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3|1000 TL, TL/2, TL/3]]\n|-\n|Processor\n|Intel 8088 running at 4.7&nbsp;MHz\n|8088 running at 7.16 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|Intel 80286 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n*16-bit memory data path<ref name=TXtechref />\n|Intel 8086 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|\n*TL, TL/2: 80286 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n*TL/3: 80286 running at 10 or 5&nbsp;MHz\n|-\n|RAM\n|128KB minimum;

The floppy drives used jumpers to select the drive number instead of the IBM cable twist. {{nowrap|128 KB}} of memory was standard, with the computer accepting up to {{nowrap|640 KB}} of total memory with the addition of expansion cards.\n\nMS-DOS 2.11, [[DeskMate]] 1.0, and a keyboard with the same layout as the [[Tandy 2000]]'s were included with the computer. Like the PCjr, the Tandy 1000 motherboard did not supply DMA, but unlike that system, it could have DMA added with a memory expansion board.  While the Tandy 1000 had three XT-compatible expansion slots, early Tandy memory upgrade boards took up two of the slots to get to {{nowrap|640 KB}}. Because the slots were {{frac|11|1|2}} inches in length instead of the PC's 13 inches, full-length cards did not fit,{{r|malloy198508}} but reviewers noted that the many built-in hardware features reduced the need for cards.{{r|rosch19851015}}\n\nA later revision of the original Tandy 1000 model was the Tandy 1000A. This revision fixed bugs, scanned expansion cards for bootable ROMs, and added a socket for a math coprocessor.\n\n===Tandy 1000 HD===\nThe original Tandy 1000 (and many other models), like most home computers sold at the time, did not have a hard disk drive.  The Tandy 1000 HD was essentially an original Tandy 1000 with a hard disk option factory installed.  The factory hard disk had a capacity on the order of 10 or 20 MB.\n\n===Tandy 1000 SX and TX===\nThe Tandy 1000 SX and TX were upgraded versions of the original Tandy 1000, utilizing a similar chassis. Two major upgrades over the original Tandy 1000 were the inclusion of a [[Direct memory access|DMA]] controller, which improved the speed of diskette operations and IBM PC-compatibility of these systems, and the addition of two additional ISA expansion slots, to offer a total of five 8-bit ISA slots.\n\n====1000 SX====\n[[File:Tandy 1000 SX with IBM Monitor.jpg|thumb|A Tandy 1000 SX with an IBM Monitor, running ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'']]\nThe Tandy 1000 SX used a 7.16&nbsp;MHz 8088-2 processor, had 384k of memory (upgradeable to 640&nbsp;KB on the motherboard), came with either one or two 5.25\" internal floppy disk drives, and had the light pen port (not a serial port) like the original Tandy 1000. An adjustable potentiometer inside the system controlled the volume of the internal speaker. The Tandy AX was an SX rebadged for sale in [[Walmart]] stores. The 1000 SX came with MS-DOS 3.2 and Deskmate II on 5.25\" 360kB diskettes.\n\nThe SX was the first Tandy 1000 in which the built-in video circuitry could be disabled via [[DIP switch]]. This was to permit the installation of an upgraded graphics card, typically an [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] or [[Video Graphics Array|VGA card]], in an expansion slot.\n\n====1000 TX====\nThe Tandy 1000 TX was similar to the 1000 SX with its detached keyboard, unique parallel port edge connector and XT-style architecture in a slightly modified case. The major difference was the 80286 CPU clocked at 8&nbsp;MHz. Similar to the [[IBM XT 286]], it featured a 16-bit-wide memory bus, although the on-board peripherals and ISA slots were 8 bits wide.<ref name=TXtechref>ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/txtech.zip</ref>\n\nThe TX had a 3.5\" internal floppy disk drive mounted in a 5.25\" bay with room for an optional second internal 3.5\" or 5.25\" floppy disk drive. The rear panel had the same ports as the 1000 SX, except that an RS-232C serial port replaced the light-pen port. The memory size was 640 KB, with sockets for an additional 128 KB devoted to the onboard video logic. This extra 128&nbsp;KB could only be used for and by the on-board video controller, so it was impractical to expand the on-board memory beyond 640&nbsp;KB if a VGA graphics card was installed. The computer came bundled with Personal DeskMate 2.\n\n===Tandy 1000 EX and HX===\nThe Tandy 1000 EX and HX were designed as entry-level IBM-compatible personal computers, and marketed as starter systems for people new to computing. They were offered in a compact, all-in-one chassis that featured a 7.16&nbsp;MHz 8088 (capable of clocking down to 4.77&nbsp;MHz), 256&nbsp;KB of memory (expandable to 640&nbsp;KB with a PLUS memory expansion board), PCjr- and CGA-compatible Tandy Video graphics controller, a keyboard and, depending on the model, either a single 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB floppy drive, or one to two 3.5\" 720&nbsp;KB floppy drives. An external floppy drive could be connected to a port on the back. The machine itself supplied power to the external drive, so only Tandy's unit was usable with the EX and HX. The external drive was the standard 360&nbsp;KB 5.25 inch format; in 1988 a compatible 720&nbsp;KB 3.5 inch model was offered.\n\nThe EX and HX are upgradable via Tandy PLUS cards, and these systems have bays for three cards. A PLUS card connector is electrically identical to an ISA slot connector, but uses a [[Berg connector|Berg-style]] 62-pin connector instead of a 62-contact ISA card-edge connector. Other PLUS cards could be installed to add serial ports, a 1200-baud modem, a clock/calendar and bus mouse board, or a proprietary Tandy network interface. Radio Shack later sold an adapter card allowing installation of a PLUS card into a standard ISA slot, such as those in the larger Tandy 1000 models.\n\nLike the original Tandy 1000, the EX and HX do not have a built-in DMA controller, though one can be added using the PLUS memory expansion board.\n\n====1000 EX====\nThe Tandy 1000 EX featured a 5.25\" floppy drive built into the right-hand side of computer casing. The EX sold for US$1,000.00 from Radio Shack in December 1986. The EX and, later, the HX would be among the most popular of the Tandy 1000 line because of their (relatively) low price.\n\nA useful feature for the EX and later systems was the ability to boot off either drive, as the drives could be logically swapped when the system booted, so that the drive that was normally drive B: became drive A:, and vice versa, and the drives remained swapped until the system was powered off or reset.  (The SX and TX have this capability as well.)\n\nThe 1000 EX came with MS-DOS 2.11 and Personal Deskmate on 5.25\" 360kB diskettes. The MS-DOS was a version specialized for and only bootable on the Tandy 1000; it included a version of BASICA (Microsoft's Advanced GW-BASIC) with support for the enhanced CGA graphics modes (a.k.a. Tandy Graphics or TGA) and three-voice sound hardware of the Tandy 1000.\n\n====1000 HX====\n[[Image:Tandy1000HX tweaked.jpg|thumbnail|right|285px|A Tandy 1000 HX, with a Tandy RGB monitor, an external 5.25-inch disk drive, joystick, and a Tandy DMP-133 [[dot matrix]] [[Computer printer|printer]]]]\nThe Tandy 1000 HX was an updated version of the EX. It utilized the same architecture and PLUS cards as the EX; however, one obvious difference was that it offered two 3.5\" bays on the front panel, occupied by one or two 720 KB 3.5\" floppy drives, as opposed to a single side-mounted 5.25\" bay and floppy drive with the EX. It also had [[Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R]] in ROM, which could be accessed by starting the computer with no bootable disk present. Another improvement over the EX is the addition of a serial EEPROM to store configuration information, enabling similar functionality to today's CMOS NVRAMs. By comparison, earlier Tandy 1000 models, like IBM PC and PC/XT systems, used DIP switches and jumpers for startup configuration settings.\n\nBy putting the basic elements of DOS and Deskmate in ROM and eliminating the memory test on startup, the HX booted quickly compared to other contemporary MS-DOS machines, despite having no immediate provisions for a hard disk drive.\n\nIn addition to Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R, the HX shipped with Personal Deskmate 2. Most versions of MS-DOS worked with the 1000 HX, including DOS 3.x, and some later versions. There was, however, a quirk in the DOS 4.0 environment that prevented that version of DOS from working with Tandy 1000 HX computers. Additionally, the installer for MS-DOS 6 could corrupt the contents of the serial EEPROM.<ref name=dos60ref />\n\n===Tandy 1000 SL and TL series===\nThe Tandy SL and TL series of computers were updates of the SX and TX, respectively. In addition to offering redesigned cases, the machines offered a more integrated motherboard with improved graphics and sound capabilities while dropping composite video output. The graphics controller now supported {{nowrap|640 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 16}} resolution as well as a [[Hercules Graphics Card]]-compatible, {{nowrap|720 \u00d7 350}} mode for monochrome monitors. Sound capabilities now included an 8-bit monaural DAC/ADC, which was similar in function to [[parallel port]] sound devices (such as the [[Covox Speech Thing]] and [[Disney Sound Source]]) but was extended to support DMA transfers, microphone input capability, and sampling rates up to 48&nbsp;kHz. The SL/TL lines allowed the on-board floppy controller, parallel port and serial ports to be disabled, which the earlier models did not.\n\nThe SL and TL were also shipped with MS-DOS 3.3 and [[DeskMate]] 3 in ROM, and featured a serial [[EEPROM]] memory chip to store BIOS settings. The machines could also run 'normal' MS-DOS 3.x, 5.x, and 6.x and Windows 2.x and 3.0 operating systems, although Windows was limited to real-mode operations. In common with many PC clones of the era, MS-DOS 4 was problematic and generally avoided.\n\n====1000 SL and SL/2====\n[[File:SL Sound Satellite.JPG|thumb|right|The SL's sound/reset satellite board]]\nThe Tandy 1000 SL and SL/2 feature an [[Intel 8086]] processor running at 8&nbsp;MHz. This is socketed, and thus upgradeable with an [[NEC V30]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits and Drawbacks of the Late Model Tandy 1000s, CPU Upgradability |url=http://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/search?q=tandy+sl%2F2 |website=Nerdly Pleasures |publisher=Great Hierophant |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> The SL came with {{nowrap|384 KB}} of RAM preinstalled, whereas the SL/2 offered {{nowrap|512 KB}}. Both machines could be expanded to {{nowrap|640 KB}}, although the graphics controller reserved a portion of this memory, yielding only {{nowrap|608 KB}} available the operating system, even on systems using add-in ISA graphic cards. The SL line had the mic/earphone ports, volume knob and reset button on a small satellite board. A jumper on the board allowed the user to change the microphone input to a line-level output.<ref name=\"radioshacksupport\">{{cite book | url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc1/1262.htm | title=Tandy faxback document #1262 | accessdate=September 6, 2014 | date=1995-04-26 }}</ref> The SL series offered five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, and did not come with pre-installed [[real-time clock]] chips, making them optional upgrades in the form of the plug-in Dallas DS1216E SmartWatch.\n\nThe SL is the only machine in the line that offers an upper 5.25\" bay, and therefore the only model to offer two 5.25\" bays, where the other models, including the SL/2 and the entire TL range, feature two upper 3.5\" bays and one lower 5.25\" bay. As a result, fitting a hard drive to an SL that already has the upper and lower 5.25\" bays populated may require either the removal of one of the devices in those bays, or the installation of a hard disk card-style bracket which seats in one of the ISA slots.\n\n====1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3====\nThe Tandy 1000 TL and TL/2 used 8&nbsp;MHz Intel 80286 processors, whereas the TL/3 used a 10&nbsp;MHz 80286. The TLs had 640&nbsp;KB of memory preinstalled, with an option for an extra 128&nbsp;KB for video frame buffering just as in the 1000 TX. Unlike the SL series machines, the TL machines came with the SmartWatch real-time clock logic built-in, which was powered by a removable 3-volt CR2032 button-cell battery on the motherboard.\n\nThe TL offered five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, while the TL/2 and TL/3 offered four slots and an on-board 8-bit, XT IDE-compatible hard disk interface, which was not compatible with standard AT IDE hard drives. The TL series offered two upper 3.5\" bays and one lower 5.25\" bay. The TL/3 also offered a high-density floppy drive controller for 1.44 MB drives, though it shipped with a double-density 3.5\" 720 KB drive.\n\nAs the processors on the TL-series are socketed, it is possible to install 386SX or Cyrix 486SLC-based processor upgrades, though the benefit of installing more advanced processors is limited beyond merely providing a speed increase due to the computers' XT-based architecture, and their resulting inability to access [[extended memory]] above 1 MB.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits and Drawbacks of the Late Model Tandy 1000s, CPU Upgradability |url=http://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/search?q=tandy+sl%2F2 |website=Nerdly Pleasures |publisher=Great Hierophant |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Tandy 1000 RL-series and RSX===\n[[File:Tandy 1000 rl 1.jpg|left|thumb|A Tandy 1000 RL running DeskMate (optional mouse not shown)]]\nThe Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX series were slim-line desktop home computers. They featured a much more compact case, with at least 512&nbsp;KB of memory pre-installed, smaller [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]]-style keyboard and mouse ports, and at least one ISA expansion slot. The RL-series and RSX include provisions for an internal hard disk drive, depending on the model: the RL-series featured a built-in [[Industry Standard Architecture#XT-IDE|XT-IDE]] hard drive interface, while the RSX featured an AT-compatible [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] interface. The keyboard connectors of the RL-series, while similar to and mechanically compatible with PS/2-style connectors, were not fully compatible with typical PS/2 keyboards, as the keyboard uses the XT keyboard protocol. The RSX, however, incorporated the AT keyboard protocol, making it the first 1000-series system to offer more complete compatibility with typical PS/2 keyboards, and AT keyboards using an adapter.\n\n====1000 RL and RL/HD====\nThe RL and RL/HD featured a surface-mounted {{nowrap|9.54 MHz}} 8086 processor, 512&nbsp;KB of RAM (expandable to 768&nbsp;KB to provide 128&nbsp;KB for video and 640&nbsp;KB conventional memory), a DB-25 unidirectional parallel port instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL's enhanced graphics and sound. A single half-size 8-bit expansion slot was available. The RL/HD had a battery-backed real-time clock chip to store date and time information, which the RL lacked. These models also had MS-DOS and a portion of DeskMate in ROM, and could therefore boot much faster than many other computers on the market. The RL/HD came with a 20MB drive preinstalled.\n\n====1000 RLX====\nThe RLX was the 'mid-range' offering of the RL line. It had a 10&nbsp;MHz 286 (surface-mounted) and 512 KB of RAM, and unlike other 286-based Tandy 1000 models, it supported 384&nbsp;KB of extended memory when RAM was expanded to the maximum 1 MB. However, it was not a full AT-class machine, as it still had an 8-bit ISA bus (as with the RL, one half-size expansion slot) and only 8 IRQs and 4 DMA channels. While the three-voice sound chip and DAC were still present, Tandy video was dropped in favor of an AcuMos [[VGA]] controller offering 256 kB of video memory and standard VGA graphics resolutions. The parallel port was bidirectional, a first for the Tandy 1000 series. The RLX had one 1.44 MB 3.5\" floppy drive; an empty drive bay could host a second such drive. The hard disk RLX/HD came with a 20&nbsp;MB hard disk and 1 MB RAM preinstalled. The hard disk occupied the empty drive bay, so this version supported only a single floppy drive.\n\n====1000 RSX====\nA more upscale offering, the RSX offered a 25&nbsp;MHz 80386SX processor, 1 MB RAM, two 16-bit ISA slots, AcuMos SVGA video, a bidirectional parallel port, and standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. It was a full 386-class PC and could run Microsoft Windows 3.x. Two sockets for SIMM memory cards were provided. Only 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs of the 9-chip type were supported, and if two were installed they had to be of like capacity. With two 4 MB SIMMs installed, the 1000 RSX could be expanded to 9 MB RAM (without using an ISA slot). The RSX/HD variant came with a 52 MB hard drive using an AT-compatible IDE interface; replacement hard drives up to 504 MB could be substituted. Because of the slimline case, only one hard drive could be installed alongside the 1.44 MB 3.5\" floppy drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 1000 RSX specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc1/1332.htm|website=Radio Shack Support|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 1000 Rl/RLX Pictures|url=http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/RLRLX.html|website=Oldskool.org|publisher=TV Dog|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe motherboard had a socket for the 80387SX math coprocessor. The RSX still retained the Tandy 1000 3-voice sound hardware and DAC, though the I/O address for the 3-voice sound chip was moved, rendering many games previously compatible with it unable to play music unless modified. The DAC could be used to emulate the Covox Speech Thing via MS-DOS device drivers for limited sound support. This worked with the game ''Chuck Yeager's Air Combat''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/chuck-yeagers-air-combat/techinfo|title=Chuck Yeager's Air Combat for DOS (1991) Tech Info|website=MobyGames|access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n\nWindows 3.xx sound device drivers were available that worked in Windows 95 (with full 9MB RAM) on Tandy 1000 RSX.\nThe ACUMOS VGA graphics could be software-updated with Cirrus Logic BIOS (via MS-DOS driver) to allow VESA/SVGA to function in Windows 95, as the Windows 3.xx Tandy VGA drivers were insufficient for Windows 95.\n\n==Selected Tandy 1000-enhanced software==\n\nMajor software publishers and makers of game and educational software, such as [[Sierra On-line|Sierra]] and [[Broderbund]], offered software titles that specifically supported Tandy's unique and proprietary 16-color graphics, 3-voice sound, and other Tandy specific hardware features. These enhancements offer a superior graphics and sound experience for Tandy 1000 owners over standard DOS titles. Software that supported Tandy's graphics were typically labelled on the package as Tandy 1000/PCjr compatible. Many Tandy 1000 enhanced games are featured on YouTube.\n\nAlthough the Tandy 1000 can run most DOS software, the below programs are known to specifically support Tandy 1000 enhanced features. These programs require DOS to run. Tandy shipped its own version of DOS. Tandy used the main memory for graphics, as a result most programs require 640k or 768k to run. The enhanced graphics and sound often tax the processor, so an 80286 processor or faster is recommended for best results.\n\nThere are also games and educational software that supports second generation Tandy 1000 graphics and sound, which offers 640 by 200 by 16 colors, and 8-bit DACs, found only on the 1000 sl/tl series. Examples of such software includes Mario's Typing Tutor, Star Trek, Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist, Sargon Chess.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''[[Arkanoid]]''\n*''[[Rastan (video game)|Rastan]]''\n*''[[Operation Wolf]]''\n*''[[LHX Attack Chopper]]''\n*''[[Thexder]]'' 1 and 2\n*''[[The Black Cauldron (video game)|The Black Cauldron]]''\n*''[[King's Quest]]'' 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n*''[[Space Quest]]'' 1, 2, and 3\n*''[[Police Quest]]''\n*''[[Silpheed]]''\n*''[[Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist]]''\n*''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]''\n*''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]''\n*''[[Mario Teaches Typing]]''\n*''[[Sargon (chess)|Sargon]]''\n*''[[Out Run]]''\n*''[[Choplifter]]''\n*''[[Reader Rabbit]]''\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES video game)#Ports|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''\n*''[[Skate or Die]]''\n*''[[Zeliard]]''\n*''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]''\n*''[[Shogun (video game)|Shogun]]''\n*''[[Alley Cat (video game)|Alley Cat]]''\n*''[[Digger (video game)|Digger]]''\n*''[[A-10 Tank Killer]]''\n*''[[Defender of the Crown]]''\n*''[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]''\n*''[[Caveman Ugh-Lympics]]''\n*''Darwin's Arena'' (a shareware game)\n*''[[The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing]]''\n*''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Sky]]''\n*''[[Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040826174904/http://support.radioshack.com/productinfo/ProductResults.asp?Name=Tandy_Desktops&ID=001001001 Radio Shack Tandy Computer Support], the official support site for Tandy Computers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070811034841/http://support.radioshack.com/productinfo/ product search page])\n* [http://www.oldskool.org/pc/tand-em/ The Tand-Em Project], a Tandy 1000 emulator project\n* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/ DOSBox] MS-DOS, Tandy 1000, PCjr Emulator\n* [http://www.mess.org/ MESS] Multiple emulator with Tandy 1000HX support\n* [http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/ Tvdog's Archive], Major archive of Tandy 1000 programs and documentation\n* [http://www.brooksdeforest.com/tandy1000/ Tandy 1000 BASIC Programs], Games and applications\n* [http://www.oldskool.org/shrines/pcjr_tandy The OldSkool Shrine], Tandy 1000 History And Memories\n* [http://r.webring.com/hub?ring=tandy1000 Tandy 1000 Webring], More Sites On The Tandy 1000\n* [http://lowendmac.com/2015/tandys-pc-compatible-computers/ Low End Mac's retrospective] on the Tandy 2000 computer and Tandy 1000 series (Daniel Knight - 2015-12-19)\n* {{YouTube |id = mYHtojsaRkY |title = The Tandy 1000 - The best MS-DOS computer in 1984. }}\n\n{{TRS-80 and Tandy computers}}\n\n[[Category:Home computers]]\n[[Category:RadioShack]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1984]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1984]]\n", "name_user": "Naz1234566", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOverview)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000"}
