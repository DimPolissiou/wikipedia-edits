In this episode, Fletcher concocts a scheme to help another prisoner get revenge on someone for cheating them of their possessions.\n\n==Synopsis==\nDue to an accident caused by falling off a ladder, Fletcher is put in the prison infirmary with a broken ankle, much to the annoyance of prison officer Mackay, who had him down for drainage detail. Alongside Fletcher, he is kept company in the infirmary by the elderly Blanco, and the unpleasant Norris, both of whom are not speaking to each other. Whilst they are on their own, Blanco reveals to Fletcher that he suspects Norris of cheating in a card game they had, which resulted in him losing his possessions as a result.\n\nThat night, Blanco informs Fletcher that if he dies before he is released from prison, he would [[bequeath]] to him a [[treasure map]] to the loot he stole. Norris overhears this, and attempts to search Fletcher's bed for it. However, this attracts the attention of prison officer Barrowclough, who scolds Norris for causing trouble and jeopardising his upcoming parole. Although he attempts to find out what he was looking for, Barrowclough decides against this on the belief it was a diversion for prisoners to escape. The next morning, Norris makes a proposition to Fletcher and Blanco for the map, offering to look after it until they are released. Fletcher agrees, only if he can find the map.\n\nAfter leaving the infirmary, Norris visits Godber, since he has been visiting with meals while on kitchen duty. Godber refuses to betray Fletcher when asked about taking anything from him with a piece of paper in it, but eventually hands over the map after Norris offers several valuable items for it. When Godber vists the infirmary on his next round, Fletcher takes delight that Norris fell for a dirty trick - the map was a fake, and the items he used to get it where those taken from Blanco. The group soon later listen to Blanco's radio, and overhear news that Norris had been arrested for digging up a [[football pitch]] in Leeds, much to their amusement.\n\n==Episode cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The story is set in [[Vienna]], Austria during the latter half of the 18th century, and is a fictionalized biography of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], described by its writer as \"fantasia on the theme of Mozart and Salieri\". Mozart's music is heard extensively in the soundtrack of the film. The film follows a fictional rivalry between Mozart and Italian composer [[Antonio Salieri]] at the court of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. The film stars [[F. Murray Abraham]] as Salieri (who received the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance) and [[Tom Hulce]] as Mozart (who was also nominated for the same award as Abraham).\n\n''Amadeus'' was released by [[Orion Pictures]] on September 19, 1984, thirteen days following its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 6, 1984. Upon release, the film received widespread acclaim and was a box office hit by grossing over $90 million.\n\nConsidered one of the [[List of films considered the best|best films]] of all time, ''Amadeus'' was nominated for 53 awards and received 40, including eight Academy Awards (as well as the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]), four BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and a Directors Guild of America award. {{As of|2019}}, it is the most recent film to have more than one nomination in the Academy Award for Best Actor category. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it 53rd on its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]] list. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds \u2018Purple Rain\u2019, \u2018Clerks\u2019, \u2018Gaslight\u2019 & More; \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Cry\u2019 One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAn elderly [[Antonio Salieri]] confesses to the murder of his former colleague, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and attempts to kill himself by slitting his throat. Two servants take him to a sanatorium where a priest, Father Vogler, implores him to confess.\n\nSalieri recounts how, even in his youth, he desired to be a composer, much to the chagrin of his father. He prays to God that, if he will make Salieri a famous composer, he will in return promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. He is educated in Vienna and becomes court composer to [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].\n\nMozart arrives in Vienna to perform at the request of his employer, [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]]. Salieri attends the performance to meet Mozart and, despite [[Mozart and scatology|Mozart's obscenity]] and immaturity, finds his talent to be [[Wiktionary:transcendent#Adjective|transcendent]].\n\nThe Emperor desires to commission Mozart to write an opera and, despite the reservations of his advisers, summons him to the palace. Mozart happily accepts the job, much to the annoyance of Salieri. Mozart premieres ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' to mixed reviews from the Emperor. Salieri believes that Mozart has slept with the star, [[Caterina Cavalieri]], despite his engagement to [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze Weber]].\n\nThe Emperor desires that Mozart instruct his niece, [[Duchess Elisabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg|Princess Elisabeth]], in music, but Salieri discourages him from doing so. Constanze visits Salieri to persuade him to make the Emperor reconsider, but she is unsuccessful.\n\nSalieri is enraged that God has bestowed upon Mozart the talent he has so desperately desired and vows to destroy Mozart. Mozart, meanwhile, struggles to find work and begins drinking. His father, [[Leopold Mozart]], comes to visit him in Vienna. Constanze and Mozart take Leopold to a masked party (which Salieri also attends), where Mozart entertains the guests with musical antics. Leopold disapproves of his son's [[Wiktionary:hedonism#Noun|hedonism]], and the family argues until Leopold leaves town.\n\nSalieri hires a young girl to pose as the Mozarts' maid while spying for him. She takes him to the Mozart residence, where he discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'', which the Emperor has forbidden. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow [[The Marriage of Figaro|his opera]] to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage.\n\nMessengers arrive in Vienna with news of Leopold's death, and in response a grief-stricken Mozart pens ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. Salieri recognizes the dead commander as symbolic of Leopold and hatches a plan. Wearing Leopold's party mask, Salieri visits Mozart and commissions a [[Requiem]] Mass. Salieri plots to kill Mozart once the piece is finished, then premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own.\n\nAt a parody of one of Mozart's own operas, [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] asks Mozart to write an opera for his theater. Mozart, desperate for money, obliges, despite Constanze's insistence that he finish the Requiem Mass. The couple fight and Constanze leaves with their young son, [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl]].\n\nMozart collapses during a performance of his finished work, ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. Salieri takes him home and offers his assistance on the Requiem. Salieri transcribes Mozart's verbal direction, and they work through the night. The next morning, a gravely ill Mozart apologizes to Salieri for his previous behavior. A guilty Constanze returns home and locks [[Requiem (Mozart)|the unfinished Requiem]] away, only to find that Mozart has died from overwork. Mozart is taken out of the city and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave during a rainstorm. His mourners, daunted by the weather, watch from the city gate as the coffin is taken away.\n\nHaving finished his tale, Salieri asks how a merciful God could destroy his own beloved just to keep a mediocrity like Salieri from sharing in his glory. As he is pushed down the hall of the sanatorium in a wheelchair, Salieri declares himself \"the patron saint of mediocrities\" and mockingly absolves the other patients of their inadequacies. Mozart's high-pitched laugh is heard as the screen fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[F.

In it, Salieri actually murders Mozart on stage. This was made into [[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|an opera]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] 67 years later,<ref name=bbc /> which in turn had its first screen adaptation by silent film director [[Victor Tourjansky]] in 1917.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nA significant departure is that Salieri was a married family man with eight children and at least one mistress, not a pious loner trapped in a vow of chastity.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/22/amadeus-reel-history ''Amadeus'': the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is]</ref>\n\nThe conflict between the composer and an Italians \"cabal\" working to block his efforts has some historical foundation, insofar as he did write of his belief in such conspiracies to others.

And in the '80s, with MTV on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don't forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, \"Well, we don't want to be pushing the audience's patience too far\". Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut out. But it was a mutual decision [to limit the running time]. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn't matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long.

The story is set in [[Vienna]], Austria during the latter half of the 18th century, and is a fictionalized biography of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], described by its writer as \"fantasia on the theme of Mozart and Salieri\". Mozart's music is heard extensively in the soundtrack of the film. The film follows a fictional rivalry between Mozart and Italian composer [[Antonio Salieri]] at the court of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. The film stars [[F. Murray Abraham]] as Salieri (who received the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance) and [[Tom Hulce]] as Mozart (who was also nominated for the same award as Abraham).\n\n''Amadeus'' was released by [[Orion Pictures]] on September 19, 1984, thirteen days following its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 6, 1984. Upon release, the film received widespread acclaim and was a box office hit by grossing over $90 million.\n\nConsidered one of the [[List of films considered the best|best films]] of all time, ''Amadeus'' was nominated for 53 awards and received 40, including eight Academy Awards (as well as the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]), four BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and a Directors Guild of America award. {{As of|2019}}, it is the most recent film to have more than one nomination in the Academy Award for Best Actor category. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it 53rd on its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]] list. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds \u2018Purple Rain\u2019, \u2018Clerks\u2019, \u2018Gaslight\u2019 & More; \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Cry\u2019 One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAn elderly [[Antonio Salieri]] confesses to the murder of his former colleague, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and attempts to kill himself by slitting his throat. Two servants take him to a sanatorium where a priest, Father Vogler, implores him to confess.\n\nSalieri recounts how, even in his youth, he desired to be a composer, much to the chagrin of his father. He prays to God that, if he will make Salieri a famous composer, he will in return promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. He is educated in Vienna and becomes court composer to [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].\n\nMozart arrives in Vienna to perform at the request of his employer, [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]]. Salieri attends the performance to meet Mozart and, despite [[Mozart and scatology|Mozart's obscenity]] and immaturity, finds his talent to be [[Wiktionary:transcendent#Adjective|transcendent]].\n\nThe Emperor desires to commission Mozart to write an opera and, despite the reservations of his advisers, summons him to the palace. Mozart happily accepts the job, much to the annoyance of Salieri. Mozart premieres ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' to mixed reviews from the Emperor. Salieri believes that Mozart has slept with the star, [[Caterina Cavalieri]], despite his engagement to [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze Weber]].\n\nThe Emperor desires that Mozart instruct his niece, [[Duchess Elisabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg|Princess Elisabeth]], in music, but Salieri discourages him from doing so. Constanze visits Salieri to persuade him to make the Emperor reconsider, but she is unsuccessful.\n\nSalieri is enraged that God has bestowed upon Mozart the talent he has so desperately desired and vows to destroy Mozart. Mozart, meanwhile, struggles to find work and begins drinking. His father, [[Leopold Mozart]], comes to visit him in Vienna. Constanze and Mozart take Leopold to a masked party (which Salieri also attends), where Mozart entertains the guests with musical antics. Leopold disapproves of his son's [[Wiktionary:hedonism#Noun|hedonism]], and the family argues until Leopold leaves town.\n\nSalieri hires a young girl to pose as the Mozarts' maid while spying for him. She takes him to the Mozart residence, where he discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'', which the Emperor has forbidden. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow [[The Marriage of Figaro|his opera]] to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage.\n\nMessengers arrive in Vienna with news of Leopold's death, and in response a grief-stricken Mozart pens ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. Salieri recognizes the dead commander as symbolic of Leopold and hatches a plan. Wearing Leopold's party mask, Salieri visits Mozart and commissions a [[Requiem]] Mass. Salieri plots to kill Mozart once the piece is finished, then premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own.\n\nAt a parody of one of Mozart's own operas, [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] asks Mozart to write an opera for his theater. Mozart, desperate for money, obliges, despite Constanze's insistence that he finish the Requiem Mass. The couple fight and Constanze leaves with their young son, [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl]].\n\nMozart collapses during a performance of his finished work, ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. Salieri takes him home and offers his assistance on the Requiem. Salieri transcribes Mozart's verbal direction, and they work through the night. The next morning, a gravely ill Mozart apologizes to Salieri for his previous behavior. A guilty Constanze returns home and locks [[Requiem (Mozart)|the unfinished Requiem]] away, only to find that Mozart has died from overwork. Mozart is taken out of the city and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave during a rainstorm. His mourners, daunted by the weather, watch from the city gate as the coffin is taken away.\n\nHaving finished his tale, Salieri asks how a merciful God could destroy his own beloved just to keep a mediocrity like Salieri from sharing in his glory. As he is pushed down the hall of the sanatorium in a wheelchair, Salieri declares himself \"the patron saint of mediocrities\" and mockingly absolves the other patients of their inadequacies. Mozart's high-pitched laugh is heard as the screen fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[F.

In it, Salieri actually murders Mozart on stage. This was made into [[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|an opera]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] 67 years later,<ref name=bbc /> which in turn had its first screen adaptation by silent film director [[Victor Tourjansky]] in 1917.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nA significant departure is that Salieri was a married family man with eight children and at least one mistress, not a pious loner trapped in a vow of chastity.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/22/amadeus-reel-history ''Amadeus'': the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is]</ref>\n\nThe conflict between the composer and an Italians \"cabal\" working to block his efforts has some historical foundation, insofar as he did write of his belief in such conspiracies to others.

Director Milo\u0161 Forman introduced an R-rated version with nearly 20 minutes of restored footage.

However, he explains why the scenes were eventually restored in a subsequent 2002 interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'':\n{{quote|\nWhen you finish a film, before the first paying audience sees it, you don't have any idea. You don't know if you made a success or a flop, when it comes to the box office. And in the '80s, with MTV on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don't forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, \"Well, we don't want to be pushing the audience's patience too far\". Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut out. But it was a mutual decision [to limit the running time]. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn't matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long.

The feed is employed mostly for [[cattle]] feeding, but is also used for [[pig]]s and [[poultry]].{{Sfn |Heuz\u00e9 |Tran |Sauvant |Lessire |2020}} However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% [[erucic acid]] and high levels of [[glucosinolates]] that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.{{Sfn|Potts|Rakow|Males|1999}}\n\n=== Vegetable oil ===\nRapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to [[cardiac muscle]] of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.{{Sfn|O'Brien|2008|pp=37-40}} Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.{{Sfn|Sahasrabudhe|1977|p=323}} Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} and 5% in the EU,{{Sfn|EC|1980}} with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human [[infants]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}}{{Sfn|EC|1980}}\n\n=== Biodiesel ===\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as [[biodiesel]], straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower [[Gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] than most other vegetable oils.\n\n=== Other ===\nRapeseed is also used as a [[cover crop]] in the US during the winter as it prevents [[soil erosion]], produces large amounts of [[biomass]], suppresses weeds and can improve soil [[tilth]] with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}}\n\nRapeseed has a high [[Melliferous flower|melliferous]] potential and is a main forage crop for [[honeybees]].{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly.{{Sfn|Lixandru|2017}} The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in [[Monofloral honey|monofloral rapeseed honey]] causes it to quickly granulate in the [[honeycomb]], forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\nAs a [[Lubricant#Biolubricant|biolubricant]], rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.{{Sfn|Salimon|Salih|Yousif|2010}} Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although they are typically more expensive.{{Sfn|Garrett|1998}}\n\nRapeseed has been researched as a means of containing [[radionuclide]]s that contaminated the soil after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}{{Sfn|RIA Novosti|2010}}{{Sfn|Walker|2010}} as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}\n\nRapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed in [[China]].{{Sfn|Bonjean|Dequidt|Sang|Limagrain|2016}}\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Champ de colza C\u00f4te-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Field of rapeseed]]\n\nCrops from the genus ''Brassica'', including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by mankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}}\n\nOilseed rape is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of [[vernalization]] to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a [[Rosette (botany)|leaf rosette]] on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6\u20138 weeks until [[midsummer]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nIn Europe, winter rape is grown as an annual break crop in three to four year rotations with cereals such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and break crops such as [[peas]] and [[beans]]. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|p=3}} Winter rape is less susceptible to [[crop failure]] as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|p=4}}\n\nSpring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after [[germination]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nRapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a [[pH]] between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of [[soil salinity]].{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}} It is predominantly a [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when [[Honey bee#Pollination|bee-pollinated]],{{Sfn|Chamb\u00f3|De Oliveira|Garcia|Duarte-J\u00fanior|2014}} almost double the final yield{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} but the effect is cultivar-dependent.{{Sfn|Lindstr\u00f6m|Herbertsson|Rundl\u00f6f|Smith|2015}} It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]]. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N<sub>2</sub>O.{{Sfn|Lewis Jr.|2007}}\n\n== Diseases and pests==\nThe main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are ''[[canker]]'', ''[[Pyrenopeziza brassicae|light leaf spot]]'', ''[[alternaria]]'' and ''[[sclerotinia]] stem rot''. Canker causes [[leaf spot]]ting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter period. A conazole or [[triazole]] [[fungicide]] treatment is required in late autumn and in spring against ''canker'' while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as ''sclerotinia'', ''[[verticillium wilt]]'' and [[clubroot]].{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n=== Pests ===\nOilseed rape is attacked by a wide variety of insects, [[nematodes]], [[slugs]] as well as [[Wood-Pigeon|wood pigeons]]. The ''[[brassica pod midge]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus assimilis|cabbage seed weevil]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus|cabbage stem weevil]]'', ''[[Psylliodes chrysocephala|cabbage stem flea beetle]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus napi|rape stem weevil]]'' and ''[[pollen beetles]]'' are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant's stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of [[prophylactic]] insecticides in many countries. [[Molluscicide]] pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n== History of the cultivars ==\nIn 1973, Canadian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientists]]  launched a marketing campaign to promote [[canola]] consumption.{{Sfn|Thiyam-Holl\u00e4nder|Eskin|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=4}} Seed, oil and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which is low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as \"canola\".{{Sfn|Mag|1983|p=380}}{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}} This is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that \"must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 \u00b5mol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.\"{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}}{{Sfn|CFIA|2017}}\n\nFollowing the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] [[Transport Biofuels Directive 2003|Transport Biofuels Directive]] in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\n[[Bayer Cropscience]], in collaboration with [[BGI-Shenzhen]], China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of ''B. napus'' and its constituent genomes present in ''B. rapa'' and ''B. oleracea'' in 2009. The \"A\" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species ''B. napus'' is currently being sequenced by the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=The www.brassica.info website for the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project\n | url=http://www.brassica.info\n}}</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}\n\nA [[genetically modified]]-for-[[glyphosate]]-tolerance variety of rapeseed which was developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort,{{Sfn|Beckie |Harker |L\u00e9g\u00e8re |Morrison |2011|p=43}} adoption of which, however, has not been free of controversy. \n\n=== GMO controversy ===\n{{Main|Roundup Ready Canola}}\n\nThe [[Monsanto]] company [[genetically engineered]] new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its [[herbicide]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the ''Roundup Ready'' gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, ''Roundup Ready'' [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteers]] were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\nIn a closely followed legal battle, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in favor of Monsanto's [[patent infringement]] claim for unlicensed growing of ''Roundup Ready'' in its 2004 ruling on ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]]'', but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of [[genetically modified crops]]. In March 2008, an [[out-of-court settlement]] between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of about CAD $660.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports global production of 36 million tons of rapeseed in the 2003\u20132004 season, and an estimated 58.4 million tons in the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134100/http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWorldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production was thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.<ref>Canola, Growing Great 2016, The Canola Council of Canada, 2007, page 3, 10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Top rapeseed producers in millions of [[tonnes]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/form?collection=Production.Crops.Primary&Domain=Production&servlet=1&hasbulk=0&version=ext&language=EN FAOSTAT].

'''[[Canola]]''' are a group of ''rapeseed'' [[cultivar]]s which were bred to have very low levels of [[erucic acid]] and are especially prized for use for human and animal food. ''Rapeseed'' is the third-largest source of [[vegetable oil]] and second-largest source of protein meal in the world.\n\n== Etymology and taxonomy ==\nThe term \"rape\" derives from the Latin word for [[turnip]], ''rapa'' or ''rapum'', cognate with the Greek word ''rhapys''.{{Sfn|OED|2016}}\n\nThe [[species]] ''Brassica napus'' belongs to the flowering plant family [[Brassicaceae]]. Rapeseed is a [[subspecies]] with the [[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]  ''B. napus ''subsp.'' napus''.{{Sfn|GRIN|2012a}} It encompasses winter and spring oilseed, vegetable and fodder rape.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} Siberian kale is a distinct leaf rape form [[Variety (botany)|variety]] (''B. napus ''var.'' pabularia'') which used to be common as a winter-annual vegetable.{{Sfn|GRIN|2010b}}{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} The second subspecies of ''B. napus'' is [[rutabaga|''B. napus ''subsp.'' rapifera'']] (also subsp. ''napobrassica''; the rutabaga, swede, or yellow turnip).{{Sfn|GRIN|2012b}}{{Sfn|NCBI|2013}}\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Brassica napus 2.jpg|thumb|Rapeseed blossoms]]\n\n''Brassica napus'' grows to {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} height with [[pinnatifid]] and [[glaucous]] lower leaves{{Sfn|Martin|1965}}{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}{{Sfn|Webb|Parnell|Doogue|1996}} and with the upper leaves clasping the stem. ''Brassica napus'' can be distinguished from ''[[Brassica nigra]]'' by the upper leaves which do not clasp the stem, and from ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' by its smaller petals which are less than {{convert|13|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}\n\nRapeseed flowers are yellow and about {{convert|17|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}} They are radial and consist of four [[petals]] in a typical cross-form, alternating with four [[sepals]]. They have indeterminate [[racemose]] flowering starting at the lowest bud and growing upward in the following days. The flowers have two lateral [[stamens]] with short filaments, and four median stamens with longer filaments whose anthers split away from the flower's center upon flowering.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nThe rapeseed pods are green and elongated [[Silique|siliquae]] during development that eventually ripen to brown. Each pod has two [[Locule|compartments]] separated by a inner central wall within which a row of oilseeds develop. The oilseeds are black and hard at maturity.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-4}}\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Northern Ireland, U K ''B. napus'' and ''B. rapa'' are recorded as escapes in roadside verges and waste ground.{{Sfn|Beesley|Wilde|1997|p=104}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Rapeseed, roasted.jpg|thumb|Roasted canola seeds]]\n\nRapeseed is grown for the production of [[compound feed|animal feed]], edible [[vegetable oils]], and [[biodiesel]]. Rapeseed was the third-leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after [[soybean]] and [[palm oil]].{{Sfn|USDA|2002|p=26}} It is the world's second-leading source of [[protein]] meal after soybean.{{Sfn|Heuz\u00e9|Tran|Sauvant|Lessire|2020}}\n\n=== Animal feed ===\nProcessing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soybean. The feed is employed mostly for [[cattle]] feeding, but is also used for [[pig]]s and [[poultry]].{{Sfn |Heuz\u00e9 |Tran |Sauvant |Lessire |2020}} However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% [[erucic acid]] and high levels of [[glucosinolates]] that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.{{Sfn|Potts|Rakow|Males|1999}}\n\n=== Vegetable oil ===\nRapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to [[cardiac muscle]] of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.{{Sfn|O'Brien|2008|pp=37-40}} Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.{{Sfn|Sahasrabudhe|1977|p=323}} Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} and 5% in the EU,{{Sfn|EC|1980}} with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human [[infants]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}}{{Sfn|EC|1980}}\n\n=== Biodiesel ===\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as [[biodiesel]], straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower [[Gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] than most other vegetable oils.\n\n=== Other ===\nRapeseed is also used as a [[cover crop]] in the US during the winter as it prevents [[soil erosion]], produces large amounts of [[biomass]], suppresses weeds and can improve soil [[tilth]] with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}}\n\nRapeseed has a high [[Melliferous flower|melliferous]] potential and is a main forage crop for [[honeybees]].{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly.{{Sfn|Lixandru|2017}} The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in [[Monofloral honey|monofloral rapeseed honey]] causes it to quickly granulate in the [[honeycomb]], forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\nAs a [[Lubricant#Biolubricant|biolubricant]], rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.{{Sfn|Salimon|Salih|Yousif|2010}} Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although they are typically more expensive.{{Sfn|Garrett|1998}}\n\nRapeseed has been researched as a means of containing [[radionuclide]]s that contaminated the soil after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}{{Sfn|RIA Novosti|2010}}{{Sfn|Walker|2010}} as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}\n\nRapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed in [[China]].{{Sfn|Bonjean|Dequidt|Sang|Limagrain|2016}}\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Champ de colza C\u00f4te-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Field of rapeseed]]\n\nCrops from the genus ''Brassica'', including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by mankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}}\n\nOilseed rape is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of [[vernalization]] to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a [[Rosette (botany)|leaf rosette]] on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6\u20138 weeks until [[midsummer]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nIn Europe, winter rape is grown as an annual break crop in three to four year rotations with cereals such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and break crops such as [[peas]] and [[beans]]. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another. Winter rape is less susceptible to [[crop failure]] as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-4}}\n\nSpring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after [[germination]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nRapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a [[pH]] between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of [[soil salinity]].{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}} It is predominantly a [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when [[Honey bee#Pollination|bee-pollinated]],{{Sfn|Chamb\u00f3|De Oliveira|Garcia|Duarte-J\u00fanior|2014}} almost double the final yield{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} but the effect is cultivar-dependent.{{Sfn|Lindstr\u00f6m|Herbertsson|Rundl\u00f6f|Smith|2015}} It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]]. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N<sub>2</sub>O.{{Sfn|Lewis Jr.|2007}}\n\n== Diseases and pests==\nThe main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are ''[[canker]]'', ''[[Pyrenopeziza brassicae|light leaf spot]]'', ''[[alternaria]]'' and ''[[sclerotinia]] stem rot''. Canker causes [[leaf spot]]ting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter period. A conazole or [[triazole]] [[fungicide]] treatment is required in late autumn and in spring against ''canker'' while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as ''sclerotinia'', ''[[verticillium wilt]]'' and [[clubroot]].{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n=== Pests ===\nOilseed rape is attacked by a wide variety of insects, [[nematodes]], [[slugs]] as well as [[Wood-Pigeon|wood pigeons]]. The ''[[brassica pod midge]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus assimilis|cabbage seed weevil]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus|cabbage stem weevil]]'', ''[[Psylliodes chrysocephala|cabbage stem flea beetle]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus napi|rape stem weevil]]'' and ''[[pollen beetles]]'' are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant's stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of [[prophylactic]] insecticides in many countries. [[Molluscicide]] pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n== History of the cultivars ==\nIn 1973, Canadian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientists]]  launched a marketing campaign to promote [[canola]] consumption.{{Sfn|Thiyam-Holl\u00e4nder|Eskin|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=4}} Seed, oil and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which is low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as \"canola\".{{Sfn|Mag|1983|p=380}}{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}} This is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that \"must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 \u00b5mol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.\"{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}}{{Sfn|CFIA|2017}}\n\nFollowing the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] [[Transport Biofuels Directive 2003|Transport Biofuels Directive]] in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\n[[Bayer Cropscience]], in collaboration with [[BGI-Shenzhen]], China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of ''B. napus'' and its constituent genomes present in ''B. rapa'' and ''B. oleracea'' in 2009. The \"A\" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species ''B. napus'' is currently being sequenced by the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=The www.brassica.info website for the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project\n | url=http://www.brassica.info\n}}</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}\n\nA [[genetically modified]]-for-[[glyphosate]]-tolerance variety of rapeseed which was developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort,{{Sfn|Beckie |Harker |L\u00e9g\u00e8re |Morrison |2011|p=43}} adoption of which, however, has not been free of controversy. \n\n=== GMO controversy ===\n{{Main|Roundup Ready Canola}}\n\nThe [[Monsanto]] company [[genetically engineered]] new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its [[herbicide]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the ''Roundup Ready'' gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, ''Roundup Ready'' [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteers]] were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\nIn a closely followed legal battle, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in favor of Monsanto's [[patent infringement]] claim for unlicensed growing of ''Roundup Ready'' in its 2004 ruling on ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]]'', but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of [[genetically modified crops]]. In March 2008, an [[out-of-court settlement]] between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of about CAD $660.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports global production of 36 million tons of rapeseed in the 2003\u20132004 season, and an estimated 58.4 million tons in the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134100/http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWorldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production was thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.<ref>Canola, Growing Great 2016, The Canola Council of Canada, 2007, page 3, 10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Top rapeseed producers in millions of [[tonnes]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/form?collection=Production.Crops.Primary&Domain=Production&servlet=1&hasbulk=0&version=ext&language=EN FAOSTAT].

His father owned Harris Hardware on the square in Carrolton.  He graduated from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in 1928 with a B.S. in [[architecture]]. In 1930, he enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  After the first year of study, he was granted by the Academy a full scholarship for the remaining three years. He graduated in 1934 and returned to Atlanta Georgia. He was licensed by the State of Georgia as an architect and worked briefly for architect Philip Schutze.

The story revolves around Shrirang who stays with his grandmother and five other women, whom he treats as mothers. When Shrirang marries Janhavi, she has a trouble dealing with six mothers-in-law.\n\n==Plot==\nShrirang lives with his grandmother and five more women whom he equally treats as his mother. He owns a business \"Gokhale Gruha Udyog\" which his grandmother had established. He falls in love with Janhavi, who lives a modest life with her father, brother and step-mother, and works in a bank. They meet on a bus-stop and develop a beautiful bond. Initially Shri does not let Janhavi know he belongs to a rich family to maintain the simplicity of their relationship. But as they both fall in love, he reveals it to her. Janhavi's stepmother creates several problems in the pair's wedding and extorts the Gokhale family on various occasions. She also arranges her alliance with an aged man called Anil Apte. Before marriage, Shri's grandmother misunderstands Janhavi, especially given her mother's greedy nature. After marriage, Janhavi wins everyone's hearts with her caring nature. She also encourages all women in their home to take up various activities and businesses. She also brings Shri's estranged uncle and father back home.\n\nJanhavi meets a road accident and in it she loses her partial memory, forgetting all about her marriage with Shri. But she still moves back to Shri's home upon knowing the fact. She falls for Shri all over again. Janhavi regains her memory after living with the Gokhale family for a while.\n\nJanhavi's little brother - Rohan, who goes by Pintya - gets in a pandemonium from his boss Kishore. His boss threatens him to do as he says. If he doesn't listen, he would kill his dad and Shri. To save his loved ones' lives, he makes Shri face extreme humiliation in front of Social Media. Everyone blames Janhavi because of what Pintya did, claiming that she did not take responsibility and stop him. Janhavi, expecting a baby, sobs over and over again, as she is in the risk of losing it. No one except Geeta and Janhavi's parents know she is pregnant. Shri is about to give Janhavi a divorce due to misunderstandings created by her stepmother. The women in the house worry about Shri and decide to do his second marriage and leave Janhavi, as they do not know that Janhavi has not done anything and she is pregnant. They find a bride for Shri. Janhavi often tries to stop Shri to tell him the truth, but can't. After some more incidents, Shri's grandmother and uncle also learn of her pregnancy and finally it is revealed to Shri at a function at 'Narmada Yoga Centre', named after Shri\u2019s mother who possibly runs the business. Over there Shri and Janhavi reunite, but they have yet to solve Baby Aatya and the five other mothers's misconceptions about Janhavi.

The story revolves around Shrirang who stays with his grandmother and five other women, whom he treats as mother. When Shrirang marries Janhavi, she has a trouble dealing with six mothers-in-law.\n\n==Plot==\nShrirang lives with his grandmother and five more women whom he equally treats as his mother. He owns a business \"Gokhale Gruha Udyog\" which his grandmother had set up. He falls in love with Janhavi, who lives a modest life with her father, brother and step-mother, and works in a bank. They meet on a bus-stop and develop a beautiful bond. Initially Shri hides it from Janhavi that he belongs to a very rich family to maintain the simplicity of their relationship. But as they both fall in love with each other, he reveals it to her. Janhavi's stepmother creates several problems in the pair's wedding and extorts the Gokhale family on various occasions. She also arranges her alliance with an aged man called Anil Apte. Before marriage, Shri's grandmother misunderstands Janhavi, especially given her mother's greedy nature. After marriage, Janhavi wins everyone's hearts with her caring nature. She also encourages all women in their home to take up various activities and businesses. She also brings Shri's estranged uncle and father back home.\n\nJanhavi meets a road accident and in it she loses her partial memory, forgetting all about her marriage with Shri. But she still moves back to Shri's home upon knowing the fact. She falls for Shri all over again. Janhavi regains her memory after living with the Gokhale family for a while.\n\nJanhavi's little brother - Rohan, who goes by Pintya - gets in a pandemonium from his boss Kishore. His boss threatens him to do as he says. If he doesn't listen, he would kill his dad and Shri. To save his loved ones' lives, he makes Shri face extreme humiliation in front of Social Media. Everyone blames Janhavi because of what Pintya did, claiming that she did not take responsibility and stop him. Janhavi, expecting a baby, sobs over and over again, as she is in the risk of losing it. No one except Geeta and Janhavi's parents know she is pregnant. Shri is about to give Janhavi a divorce due to misunderstandings created by her stepmother. The women in house get worried about Shri and decide to do his second marriage and leave Janhavi, as they do not know that Janhavi has not done anything and she is pregnant. They find a bride for Shri. Janhavi often tries to stop Shri to tell him the truth but she can't. After some more incidents, Shri's grandmother and uncle also learn of her pregnancy and finally it is revealed to Shri at a function at 'Narmada Yoga Centre', named after Shri\u2019s mother who possibly runs the business. Over there Shri and Janhavi come back together but they have yet to solve the misunderstandings Baby Aatya and all five other mothers have about Janhavi. And as a result of which Shri stops talking with his 6 mothers and then Janhavi removes misunderstanding of his mothers by her tricks. Now it's a matter of Pintya's wedding which she's trying to deal with. His mother is trying to hook him up with a rich family, whereas he has fallen for a girl at his office. However, she lives in Dharavi, the biggest slum in Asia. His mother demands him to chuck her out of his life. Shri advises him to run away and get married. On the other hand, Janhavi thinks she can try and explain the situation to her vicious stepmom. Pintya's dad agrees with Shri's opinion.

The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas fail-stop failure mode simply means that the only way to fail is a [[Node (computer science)|node]] crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions, which means that the failed node can generate arbitrary data, including data that makes it appear like a functioning node. Thus, Byzantine failures can confuse failure detection systems, which makes fault tolerance difficult.

It is in this setting that practical algorithms have been devised.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe problem of obtaining Byzantine consensus was conceived and formalized by [[Robert Shostak]], who dubbed it the ''interactive consistency'' problem. This work was done in 1978 in the context of the NASA-sponsored SIFT<ref name=\":0\" /> project in the Computer Science Lab at [[SRI International]]. SIFT (for Software Implemented Fault Tolerance) was the brain child of John Wensley, and was based on the idea of using multiple general-purpose computers that would communicate through pairwise messaging in order to reach a consensus, even if some of the computers were faulty.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, it was not clear how many computers in total are needed to guarantee that a conspiracy of ''n'' faulty computers could not \"thwart\" the efforts of the correctly-operating ones to reach consensus. Shostak showed that a minimum of 3''n+''1 are needed, and devised a two-round 3''n+1'' messaging protocol that would work for ''n''=1. His colleague Marshall Pease generalized the algorithm for any n > 0, proving that 3''n''+1 is both necessary and sufficient. These results, together with a later proof by [[Leslie Lamport]] of the sufficiency of 3''n'' using digital signatures, were published in the seminal paper, ''Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults.''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pease|first=Marshall|last2=Shostak|first2=Robert|last3=Lamport|first3=Leslie|date=April 1980|title=Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults|url=|journal=Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery|volume=27|issue=2|pages=228\u2013234|doi=10.1145/322186.322188|citeseerx=10.1.1.68.4044}}</ref> The authors were awarded the 2005 [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize]] for this paper.\n\nTo make the interactive consistency problem easier to understand, Lamport devised a colorful allegory in which a group of army generals formulate a plan for attacking a city. In its original version, the story cast the generals as commanders of the [[Albania]]n army. The name was changed, eventually settling on \"[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]\", at the suggestion of Jack Goldberg to future-proof any potential offense giving.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamport |first1=Leslie |title=The Byzantine Generals Problem |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/ |journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems |publisher=SRI International |accessdate=18 March 2019|date=2016-12-19 }}</ref> This formulation of the problem, together with some additional results, were presented by the same authors in their 1982 paper, \"The Byzantine Generals Problem\".<ref name=BGP_Paper />\n\nIn its simplest form, the generals must decide only whether to attack or retreat. Some generals may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that every general agrees on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a [[rout]], and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.\n\nThe problem is complicated by the presence of treacherous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so selectively. For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest. Those who received a retreat vote from the ninth general will retreat, while the rest will attack (which may not go well for the attackers). The problem is complicated further by the generals being physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.\n\nByzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if the loyal (non-faulty) generals have a majority agreement on their strategy. There can be a default vote value given to missing messages. For example, missing messages can be given the value &lt;Null&gt;. Further, if the agreement is that the &lt;Null&gt; votes are in the majority, a pre-assigned default strategy can be used (e.g., retreat).<ref name=BGP_Paper>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamport | first1 = L. | authorlink1 = Leslie Lamport| last2 = Shostak | first2 = R. | last3 = Pease | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/357172.357176 | title = The Byzantine Generals Problem | journal = ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 387\u2013389 | year=1982 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170207104645/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf | archivedate = 7 February 2017 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.64.2312 }}</ref>\n\nThe typical mapping of this story onto computer systems is that the computers are the generals and their digital communication system links are the messengers. Although the problem is formulated in the analogy as a decision-making and security problem, in electronics, it cannot be solved simply by [[cryptographic]] [[digital signature]]s, because failures such as incorrect voltages can propagate through the encryption process. Thus, a component may appear functioning to one component and faulty to another, which prevents forming a consensus as to whether the component is faulty or not.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{bad linked references|section|date=January 2019}}\n\nSeveral examples of Byzantine failures that have occurred are given in two equivalent journal papers.<ref name=\"DriscollHall2004\" /><ref name=\"DriscollHall2003\" /> These and other examples are described on the [[NASA]] DASHlink web pages.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/624/ | title = Real System Failures | last = Driscoll | first = Kevin | date = 2012-12-11 | publisher = [[NASA]] | access-date = 2015-03-02 | website = DASHlink | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190610/https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/624/ | archive-date = 2015-04-02 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> These web pages also describe some phenomena that can cause Byzantine faults.\n\nByzantine errors were observed infrequently and at irregular points during endurance testing for the newly constructed [[Virginia-class submarine|''Virginia'' class submarines]], at least through 2005 (when the issues were publicly reported).<ref name=\"WalterEllis2005\">{{cite book|last1=Walter|first1=C.|title=Ninth IEEE International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE'05)|last2=Ellis|first2=P.|last3=LaValley|first3=B.|chapter=The Reliable Platform Service: A Property-Based Fault Tolerant Service Architecture|year=2005|pages=34\u201343|doi=10.1109/HASE.2005.23|isbn=978-0-7695-2377-4}}</ref>\n\n== Early solutions ==\n\nSeveral solutions were described by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in 1982.<ref name=BGP_Paper/> They began by noting that the Generals' Problem can be reduced to solving a \"Commander and Lieutenants\" problem where loyal Lieutenants must all act in unison and that their action must correspond to what the Commander ordered in the case that the Commander is loyal:\n\n* One solution considers scenarios in which messages may be forged, but which will be ''Byzantine-fault-tolerant'' as long as the number of traitorous generals does not equal or exceed one third of the generals. The impossibility of dealing with one-third or more traitors ultimately reduces to proving that the one Commander and two Lieutenants problem cannot be solved, if the Commander is traitorous. To see this, suppose we have a traitorous Commander A, and two Lieutenants, B and C: when A tells B to attack and C to retreat, and B and C send messages to each other, forwarding A's message, neither B nor C can figure out who is the traitor, since it is not necessarily A\u2014another Lieutenant could have forged the message purportedly from A. It can be shown that if ''n'' is the number of generals in total, and ''t'' is the number of traitors in that ''n'', then there are solutions to the problem only when ''n'' &gt; 3''t'' and the communication is synchronous (bounded delay).<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = P. | last1 = Feldman | first2 = S. | last2 = Micali | url = http://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Distributed%20Computation/An%20Optimal%20Probabilistic%20Algorithm%20for%20Byzantine%20Agreement.pdf | title = An optimal probabilistic protocol for synchronous Byzantine agreement | journal = SIAM J.

For [[Critical system#Security critical|security-critical systems]], [[digital signature]]s (in modern computer systems, this may be achieved in practice using [[public-key cryptography]]) can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in the presence of an arbitrary number of traitorous generals. However, for [[safety-critical system]]s (where \"security\" addresses intelligent threats while \"safety\" addresses the inherent dangers of an activity or mission), simple error detecting codes, such as [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRCs]], provide weaker but often sufficient coverage at a much lower cost. This is true for both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. Furthermore, sometimes security measures weaken safety and vice versa. Thus, cryptographic digital signature methods are not a good choice for safety-critical systems, unless there is also a specific security threat as well.<ref name=\"PaulitschMorris2005\">{{cite book | last1=Paulitsch | first1=M. | title=2005 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'05) | last2=Morris | first2=J. | last3=Hall | first3=B. | last4=Driscoll | first4=K. | last5=Latronico | first5=E. | last6=Koopman | first6=P. | chapter=Coverage and the Use of Cyclic Redundancy Codes in Ultra-Dependable Systems | year=2005 | pages=346\u2013355 | doi=10.1109/DSN.2005.31| isbn=978-0-7695-2282-1 }}</ref> While error detecting codes, such as CRCs, are better than cryptographic techniques, neither provide adequate coverage for active electronics in safety-critical systems.

The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas fail-stop failure mode simply means that the only way to fail is a [[Node (computer science)|node]] crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions, which means that the failed node can generate arbitrary data, including data that makes it appear like a functioning node. Thus, Byzantine failures can confuse failure detection systems, which makes fault tolerance difficult. Despite the analogy, a Byzantine failure is not necessarily a [[security]] problem involving hostile human interference: it can arise purely from electrical or software faults.\n\nThe terms fault and failure are used here according to the standard definitions<ref name=\"AvizienisLaprie2004\">{{cite journal| last1=Avizienis | first1=A.| last2=Laprie| first2=J.-C.| last3=Randell| first3=Brian| author-link3=Brian Randell| last4=Landwehr| first4=C.| title=Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing| journal=IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing| volume=1| issue=1| year=2004| pages=11\u201333| issn=1545-5971 | doi=10.1109/TDSC.2004.2| hdl=1903/6459}}</ref> originally created by a joint committee on \"Fundamental Concepts and Terminology\" formed by the [[IEEE]] Computer Society's Technical Committee on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerance and [[IFIP]] Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance.<ref>{{cite web| title = Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance| url = http://www.dependability.org| accessdate = 2015-03-02| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402141319/http://www.dependability.org/| archive-date = 2015-04-02| url-status=live| df = }}</ref> A version of these definitions is also described in the [[Dependability]] Wikipedia page.\n\n== Caveat ==\nByzantine fault tolerance is only concerned about broadcast correctness, that is, the property that when one component broadcasts a single consistent value to other components (i.e sends the same value to the other components), they all receive exactly the same value, or in the case that the broadcaster is not consistent, the other components agree on a common value. This kind of fault tolerance does not encompass the correctness of the value itself; for example, an adversarial component that deliberately sends an incorrect value, but sends that same value consistently to all components, will not be caught in the Byzantine fault tolerance scheme.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n'''Setting:''' \n<ref>Generalized Communication and SecurityModelsin Byzantine Agreement, Matthias Fitzi https://www.crypto.ethz.ch/publications/files/Fitzi03.pdf</ref>\nGiven a system of <math>n</math> components, <math>t</math> of which are dishonest, and assuming only point-to-point channel between all the components.\n\nWhenever a component <math>A</math>  tries to broadcast a value <math>x</math>, the other components are allowed to discuss with each other and verify the consistency of  <math>A</math>'s broadcast, and eventually settle on a common value  <math>y</math> .\n\n'''Property:'''\n\nThe system is said to resist Byzantine Faults if when a component  <math>A</math> broadcast a value  <math>x</math>:\n\n# If <math>A</math> is honest, then all honest components agree on  the value  <math>x</math>.\n# In any case, all honest components agree on the same value  <math>y</math>.\n\n<br />'''Variants:'''\n\nThe problem has been studied in the case of both synchronous and asynchronous communications.\n\nThe communication graph above is assumed to be the complete graph (i.e each component can discuss with every other), but the communication graph can be restricted.\n\nIt can also be relaxed in a more \"realistic\" problem where the faulty components do not collude together in an attempt to lure the others into error. It is in this setting that practical algorithms have been devised.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe problem of obtaining Byzantine consensus was conceived and formalized by [[Robert Shostak]], who dubbed it the ''interactive consistency'' problem. This work was done in 1978 in the context of the NASA-sponsored SIFT<ref name=\":0\" /> project in the Computer Science Lab at [[SRI International]]. SIFT (for Software Implemented Fault Tolerance) was the brain child of John Wensley, and was based on the idea of using multiple general-purpose computers that would communicate through pairwise messaging in order to reach a consensus, even if some of the computers were faulty.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, it was not clear how many computers in total are needed to guarantee that a conspiracy of ''n'' faulty computers could not \"thwart\" the efforts of the correctly-operating ones to reach consensus. Shostak showed that a minimum of 3''n+''1 are needed, and devised a two-round 3''n+1'' messaging protocol that would work for ''n''=1. His colleague Marshall Pease generalized the algorithm for any n > 0, proving that 3''n''+1 is both necessary and sufficient. These results, together with a later proof by [[Leslie Lamport]] of the sufficiency of 3''n'' using digital signatures, were published in the seminal paper, ''Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults.''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pease|first=Marshall|last2=Shostak|first2=Robert|last3=Lamport|first3=Leslie|date=April 1980|title=Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults|url=|journal=Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery|volume=27|issue=2|pages=228\u2013234|doi=10.1145/322186.322188|citeseerx=10.1.1.68.4044}}</ref> The authors were awarded the 2005 [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize]] for this paper.\n\nTo make the interactive consistency problem easier to understand, Lamport devised a colorful allegory in which a group of army generals formulate a plan for attacking a city. In its original version, the story cast the generals as commanders of the [[Albania]]n army. The name was changed, eventually settling on \"[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]\", at the suggestion of Jack Goldberg to future-proof any potential offense giving.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamport |first1=Leslie |title=The Byzantine Generals Problem |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/ |journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems |publisher=SRI International |accessdate=18 March 2019|date=2016-12-19 }}</ref> This formulation of the problem, together with some additional results, were presented by the same authors in their 1982 paper, \"The Byzantine Generals Problem\".<ref name=BGP_Paper />\n\nIn its simplest form, the generals must decide only whether to attack or retreat. Some generals may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that every general agrees on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a [[rout]], and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.\n\nThe problem is complicated by the presence of treacherous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so selectively. For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest. Those who received a retreat vote from the ninth general will retreat, while the rest will attack (which may not go well for the attackers). The problem is complicated further by the generals being physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.\n\nByzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if the loyal (non-faulty) generals have a majority agreement on their strategy. There can be a default vote value given to missing messages. For example, missing messages can be given the value &lt;Null&gt;. Further, if the agreement is that the &lt;Null&gt; votes are in the majority, a pre-assigned default strategy can be used (e.g., retreat).<ref name=BGP_Paper>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamport | first1 = L. | authorlink1 = Leslie Lamport| last2 = Shostak | first2 = R. | last3 = Pease | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/357172.357176 | title = The Byzantine Generals Problem | journal = ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 387\u2013389 | year=1982 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170207104645/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf | archivedate = 7 February 2017 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.64.2312 }}</ref>\n\nThe typical mapping of this story onto computer systems is that the computers are the generals and their digital communication system links are the messengers. Although the problem is formulated in the analogy as a decision-making and security problem, in electronics, it cannot be solved simply by [[cryptographic]] [[digital signature]]s, because failures such as incorrect voltages can propagate through the encryption process. Thus, a component may appear functioning to one component and faulty to another, which prevents forming a consensus as to whether the component is faulty or not.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{bad linked references|section|date=January 2019}}\n\nSeveral examples of Byzantine failures that have occurred are given in two equivalent journal papers.<ref name=\"DriscollHall2004\" /><ref name=\"DriscollHall2003\" /> These and other examples are described on the [[NASA]] DASHlink web pages.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/624/ | title = Real System Failures | last = Driscoll | first = Kevin | date = 2012-12-11 | publisher = [[NASA]] | access-date = 2015-03-02 | website = DASHlink | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190610/https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/624/ | archive-date = 2015-04-02 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> These web pages also describe some phenomena that can cause Byzantine faults.\n\nByzantine errors were observed infrequently and at irregular points during endurance testing for the newly constructed [[Virginia-class submarine|''Virginia'' class submarines]], at least through 2005 (when the issues were publicly reported).<ref name=\"WalterEllis2005\">{{cite book|last1=Walter|first1=C.|title=Ninth IEEE International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE'05)|last2=Ellis|first2=P.|last3=LaValley|first3=B.|chapter=The Reliable Platform Service: A Property-Based Fault Tolerant Service Architecture|year=2005|pages=34\u201343|doi=10.1109/HASE.2005.23|isbn=978-0-7695-2377-4}}</ref>\n\n== Early solutions ==\n\nSeveral solutions were described by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in 1982.<ref name=BGP_Paper/> They began by noting that the Generals' Problem can be reduced to solving a \"Commander and Lieutenants\" problem where loyal Lieutenants must all act in unison and that their action must correspond to what the Commander ordered in the case that the Commander is loyal:\n\n* One solution considers scenarios in which messages may be forged, but which will be ''Byzantine-fault-tolerant'' as long as the number of traitorous generals does not equal or exceed one third of the generals. The impossibility of dealing with one-third or more traitors ultimately reduces to proving that the one Commander and two Lieutenants problem cannot be solved, if the Commander is traitorous. To see this, suppose we have a traitorous Commander A, and two Lieutenants, B and C: when A tells B to attack and C to retreat, and B and C send messages to each other, forwarding A's message, neither B nor C can figure out who is the traitor, since it is not necessarily A\u2014another Lieutenant could have forged the message purportedly from A. It can be shown that if ''n'' is the number of generals in total, and ''t'' is the number of traitors in that ''n'', then there are solutions to the problem only when ''n'' &gt; 3''t'' and the communication is synchronous (bounded delay).<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = P. | last1 = Feldman | first2 = S. | last2 = Micali | url = http://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Distributed%20Computation/An%20Optimal%20Probabilistic%20Algorithm%20for%20Byzantine%20Agreement.pdf | title = An optimal probabilistic protocol for synchronous Byzantine agreement | journal = SIAM J.

For [[Critical system#Security critical|security-critical systems]], [[digital signature]]s (in modern computer systems, this may be achieved in practice using [[public-key cryptography]]) can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in the presence of an arbitrary number of traitorous generals. However, for [[safety-critical system]]s (where \"security\" addresses intelligent threats while \"safety\" addresses the inherent dangers of an activity or mission), simple error detecting codes, such as [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRCs]], provide weaker but often sufficient coverage at a much lower cost. This is true for both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. Furthermore, sometimes security measures weaken safety and vice versa. Thus, cryptographic digital signature methods are not a good choice for safety-critical systems, unless there is also a specific security threat as well.<ref name=\"PaulitschMorris2005\">{{cite book | last1=Paulitsch | first1=M. | title=2005 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'05) | last2=Morris | first2=J. | last3=Hall | first3=B. | last4=Driscoll | first4=K. | last5=Latronico | first5=E. | last6=Koopman | first6=P. | chapter=Coverage and the Use of Cyclic Redundancy Codes in Ultra-Dependable Systems | year=2005 | pages=346\u2013355 | doi=10.1109/DSN.2005.31| isbn=978-0-7695-2282-1 }}</ref> While error detecting codes, such as CRCs, are better than cryptographic techniques, neither provide adequate coverage for active electronics in safety-critical systems.
