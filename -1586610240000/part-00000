Within the chamber are four inner enclosures outside each ring corner.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> While similar in profile and nature to WWE's original large scale steel-structured match [[Hell in a Cell]], the Elimination Chamber match is a multiple participant match wherein two participants begin the match in the ring as the remaining four are held within each inner enclosure and are released into the match at five-minute intervals. The objective is to eliminate each opponent from the match via [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]]. The winner is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated. As in the Hell in a Cell match, disqualifications do not apply.

The steel cage was the first type of cage-based match in professional wrestling and consisted of four fenced walls of steel surrounding the [[wrestling ring|ring apron]] while the Hell in a Cell was a taller roofed version that surrounded the ring and ringside area on the ground rather than the apron. In 2002, WWE announced the creation of the Elimination Chamber, a match that combined elements of WWE's [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell matches]], [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]], [[Survivor Series#Survivor Series matches|Survivor Series matches]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) [[WarGames match]]es,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/mostextremematches/mostextremematches7|title=Ragin' Cagin' at War Games|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|first=Lennie|last=DiFino|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref> such as the [[countdown]] timer and time intervals from the Royal Rumble and War Games matches, the large enclosed cage format of both Hell in a Cell and War Games and the elimination process from the Survivor Series contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.sports.ign.com/articles/454/454029p1.html|title=WWE Smackdown Top 10: #10: The Elimination Chamber.|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Jon|last=Robinson|date=9 October 2003|accessdate=9 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004602/http://uk.sports.ign.com/articles/454/454029p1.html|archive-date=13 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Brand and pay-per-view designation ===\n[[File:Kane With A Sidewalk Slam.jpg|thumb|250px|The Raw brand Elimination Chamber match in January 2006]]\nTo exploit additional on-screen talent after buying [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in March 2001, the following year WWE began a [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] that divided the roster between the two brands of WWE, namely [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_03_27.jsp |title=WWE To Make RAW and SMACKDOWN Distinct Television Brands |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=6 February 2011 |date=27 March 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417115226/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_03_27.jsp |archivedate=17 April 2010 }}</ref> Former WCW President and then Raw [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Eric Bischoff]] formally announced the creation of the chamber during the October 21 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and scheduled the match to feature participants from the Raw brand roster at the [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1035288452.shtml|title=Full WWE RAW Results - 10/21/02 (24 hours after No Mercy)|publisher=Wrestleview.com|first=Christopher|last=Ouellette|date=22 October 2002|accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref> The match was exclusive to the Raw brand for the first four matches and at [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|joint-branded pay-per-view events]], but upon the creation of the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand in 2006 the match was instead promoted for the newly created brand at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]].<ref name=\"wv1\"/> Beginning in 2008, the match became exclusive to the [[WWE No Way Out|No Way Out]] event and two Elimination Chamber matches were featured annually for two years among the three brands.<ref name=\"NWO08\"/><ref name=\"NWO09\"/> In 2010, WWE replaced their No Way Out event with the self-titled [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]], a new event which continued the tradition of its predecessor.

He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed and his jacket briefly caught on fire. He suffered first and second-degree burns to his neck and chest and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury \"looked like a bad sunburn\". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort.\n\n== Match ==\n=== Rules ===\nThe Elimination Chamber match is a variation of elimination-based matches which draws elements from steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches in that the [[wrestling ring]] is surrounded by a large steel-fenced cage supported by [[girder]]s. Originally, its design was a circular-like chain-linked structure, but since 2017 it is now square and encloses the ring. Its floor is platformed over the ringside area around the ring which elevates and levels it with the ring mat. Within the Elimination Chamber, four enclosures, referred to as inner chambers or pods, are encased in [[plexiglass]] and face the outside of each ring post.<ref name=\"Description\"/> The match is contested by six or seven participants: two or three starting in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> The [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2018 featured a seven-man chamber match in which three participants began. Every five minutes, one of the four participants within an inner chamber enters the match. This continues until all four have been released, meaning an Elimination Chamber match typically lasts over twenty or more minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> \n\nThe objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by scoring a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or a [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]]. These can occur in the ring or on the chamber's elevated floor, but starting with the 2012 event all pinfalls and submissions must take place within the ring. Disqualifications and count-outs do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated (or after all members of the opposing tag team are eliminated in either the tag team matches or the twelve-on-twelve tornado tag team elimination matches).<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /> The same rules apply when the match involves six tag teams where two teams start in the ring and a new team leaves the pod enters the ring after every five minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|title=Specialty Matches: Elimination Chamber|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=6 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224045708/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|archivedate=24 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:WWE_Elimination_Chamber_2017.jpg|thumb|200px|The current alteration of the Elimination Chamber structure was introduced at the [[Elimination Chamber (2017)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2017]]\nAccording to a ''[[WWE Magazine]]'' article in 2009 by WWE's [[production designer]] Jason Robinson, who co-designed the structure, several designs for the Elimination Chamber were considered. The structure was manufactured in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and took six to eight weeks to make from design blueprints. It cost [[United States dollar|US$]] 250,000 to construct.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Jason|date=January 2009|title=Cold Steel|journal=[[WWE Magazine]]|pages=pg. 49}}</ref>\n\nThe structure is made of black-painted steel with an outer structure of 16 frames, each weighing {{Convert|300|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /> The chamber is {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighs a total of {{convert|16|ST|kg|abbr=on}}, 10 of which consists of steel.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /><ref name=\"Almanac\">{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work= Wrestling\u2019s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=119}}</ref><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> Each inner chamber consists of three large steel framed sheets of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]], costing US$225 per sheet.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> The chains that surround the chamber stretch {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|6|ST|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Almanac\" /><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/>\n\nA {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} flatbed truck is needed to transport the chamber. Assembly in the arena takes eight hours to complete and eight motors are used to suspend the structure over the ring before each event.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> When not in use, the structure is stored at a dock in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> Unlike standard steel cage matches and Hell in a Cell matches, Elimination Chamber matches cannot be held at several arenas due to the structure's massive size and weight, similar to how [[WarGames match]]es could only be held at certain arenas. This would play a factor in WWE dropping the annual Elimination Chamber event.<ref name=Steph>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/543179-stephanie-mcmahon-reveals-the-real-reason-why-wwe-dropped-the-elimination-chamber-ppv|title=Stephanie McMahon Reveals the Real Reason Why WWE Dropped the Elimination Chamber PPV|last=Paglino|first=Nick|date=January 15, 2015|website=Wrestlezone|publisher=Evolve Media|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the Elimination Chamber event returned (2017's event was SmackDown-exclusive while 2018's was Raw-exclusive). In addition, the chamber structure was redesigned, becoming square instead of circular. The pods were also changed from circular to square and feature sliding doors that referees slide open from outside the chamber. At the top of the chamber at its center which is now {{convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall is a large cutout of the WWE logo. The steel grates between the ring and the cage were also replaced with padding. LED lights also line the corners of the structure. The redesign was for practical purposes due to certain venues only being able to house the previous structure, allowing most venues to host the Chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/how-the-new-wwe-elimination-chamber-design-compares-compared-to-old-previous-one-photos-dimensions/|title=How the New WWE Elimination Chamber Design Compares to the Old One|date=February 12, 2017|last=Morrow|first=Brendan|work=[[Heavy.com]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Variations ===\nThe fifth match, held by the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]], was a slight variation called the [[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme]] Elimination Chamber.<ref name=\"ECWChamber\">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/decembertodismember/matches/32934421/results/|accessdate=2 February 2008|title=Mission Accomplished|last=Tello| first=Craig|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=3 December 2006}}</ref> In this variation, each chamber had one of four [[foreign object (professional wrestling)|weapons]] for the competitors locked inside to hold on to.

Both team members were inside of their respective pods, for a total of six tag teams in the match. This match was for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]]. This variation was repeated in 2019, but for women and to determine the inaugural holders of the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]].\n\nThe 2018 Elimination Chamber featured the first seven-man chamber match. Due to the extra person, three competitors started the match instead of two. The 2018 event also featured the first women's chamber match, but there were no variations in the rules.\n\n=== Interference ===\nDespite the structure, interference has become common inside the Elimination Chamber. At [[New Year's Revolution (2005)|New Year's Revolution]] in January 2005, [[Ric Flair]] distracted guest referee [[Shawn Michaels]]. allowing [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] who had been eliminated to attack [[Randy Orton]] so [[Triple H]] could win the match. At [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]] in February 2009, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] attacked [[Kofi Kingston]] during his entrance and locked himself in one of the pods becoming a participant in the match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] after losing the [[WWE Championship]] earlier in the night. At [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2010, [[Cody Rhodes]] passed [[Ted DiBiase Jr.]] a metal pipe which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the chamber to cost [[The Undertaker]] his World Heavyweight Championship to [[Chris Jericho]]. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2013)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2013, [[Mark Henry]] took out the remaining participants in the chamber for a World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania 29]] after being eliminated until [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] General Manager [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] broke it up. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2014)|Elimination Chamber]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] in February 2014, [[The Wyatt Family]] interfered by attacking [[John Cena]], leading to his eventual elimination  by Randy Orton. [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] would then come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the chamber, but would then interfere to cost [[Daniel Bryan]] the match to Orton.\n\n=== Match history ===\nThe Elimination Chamber debuted at WWE's event [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/10-best-elimination-chamber-matches|title=Which brutal Elimination Chamber Match stands above the rest?|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Since the inaugural match, there have been 25 other matches (26 overall) as of [[Elimination Chamber (2020)|Elimination Chamber]] in March 2020.

[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] has been featured in two matches, including its [[No Way Out (2008)|joint-branded match]] with SmackDown. The SmackDown brand has been featured in eight matches, including the joint-branded matches with both ECW and Raw. The [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] event has featured more Elimination Chamber matches than any other [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|WWE pay-per-view event]], with seventeen matches being held. [[Triple H]] has the most number of victories with four. [[Chris Jericho]] holds the distinctions of being involved in the most number of Elimination Chamber matches to date (8) and eliminating the most wrestlers (10).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/by-the-numbers|title=Elimination Chamber: by the numbers|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> [[Braun Strowman]] and [[Shayna Baszler]] have the most eliminations in a single Elimination Chamber match (5); Baszler is also the only winner to eliminate all other opponents in a single match.\n\nThe majority of matches have been contested for a top-tier championship with the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[WWE Championship]] (once as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship) being contested for the most in seven matches each and the [[ECW World Championship]], [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], and [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] being contested in one match each. Six matches (two in 2008 and one in 2011, 2013, 2018, and 2020) awarded the winners the number-one contendership for the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, [[WWE Universal Championship]], and Raw Women's Championship, respectively, at those years' [[WrestleMania]]. The Elimination Chamber match has been contested only in [[indoor arena]]s in the United States and once in Puerto Rico. From 2008 to 2014, the match had been featured in February pay-per-view events only. An Elimination Chamber pay-per-view event took place on May 31, 2015 exclusively on the [[WWE Network]].

The objective is to eliminate each opponent from the match via [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]].

He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed and his jacket briefly caught on fire. He suffered first and second-degree burns to his neck and chest and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury \"looked like a bad sunburn\". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort.\n\n== Match ==\n=== Rules ===\nThe Elimination Chamber match is a variation of elimination-based matches which draws elements from steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches in that the [[wrestling ring]] is surrounded by a large steel-fenced cage supported by [[girder]]s. Originally, its design was a circular-like chain-linked structure, but since 2017 it is now square and encloses the ring. Its floor is platformed over the ringside area around the ring which elevates and levels it with the ring mat. Within the Elimination Chamber, four enclosures, referred to as inner chambers or pods, are encased in [[plexiglass]] and face the outside of each ring post.<ref name=\"Description\"/> The match is contested by six or seven participants: two or three starting in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> The [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2018 featured a seven-man chamber match in which three participants began. Every five minutes, one of the four participants within an inner chamber enters the match. This continues until all four have been released, meaning an Elimination Chamber match typically lasts over twenty or more minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> \n\nThe objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by scoring a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or a [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]]. These can occur in the ring or on the chamber's elevated floor, but starting with the 2012 event all pinfalls and submissions must take place within the ring. Disqualifications and count-outs do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated (or after all members of the opposing tag team are eliminated in either the tag team matches or the twelve-on-twelve tornado tag team elimination matches).<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /> The same rules apply when the match involves six tag teams where two teams start in the ring and a new team leaves the pod enters the ring after every five minutes.<ref name=\"ECMatch\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|title=Specialty Matches: Elimination Chamber|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=6 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224045708/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|archivedate=24 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:WWE_Elimination_Chamber_2017.jpg|thumb|200px|The current alteration of the Elimination Chamber structure was introduced at the [[Elimination Chamber (2017)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2017]]\nAccording to a ''[[WWE Magazine]]'' article in 2009 by WWE's [[production designer]] Jason Robinson, who co-designed the structure, several designs for the Elimination Chamber were considered. The structure was manufactured in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and took six to eight weeks to make from design blueprints. It cost [[United States dollar|US$]] 250,000 to construct.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Jason|date=January 2009|title=Cold Steel|journal=[[WWE Magazine]]|pages=pg. 49}}</ref>\n\nThe structure is made of black-painted steel with an outer structure of 16 frames, each weighing {{Convert|300|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /> The chamber is {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighs a total of {{convert|16|ST|kg|abbr=on}}, 10 of which consists of steel.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\" /><ref name=\"Almanac\">{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work= Wrestling\u2019s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=119}}</ref><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/> Each inner chamber consists of three large steel framed sheets of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]], costing US$225 per sheet.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> The chains that surround the chamber stretch {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|6|ST|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Almanac\" /><ref name=\"ECMatch\"/>\n\nA {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} flatbed truck is needed to transport the chamber. Assembly in the arena takes eight hours to complete and eight motors are used to suspend the structure over the ring before each event.<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> When not in use, the structure is stored at a dock in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"WWEMag-Design\"/> Unlike standard steel cage matches and Hell in a Cell matches, Elimination Chamber matches cannot be held at several arenas due to the structure's massive size and weight, similar to how [[WarGames match]]es could only be held at certain arenas. This would play a factor in WWE dropping the annual Elimination Chamber event.<ref name=Steph>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/543179-stephanie-mcmahon-reveals-the-real-reason-why-wwe-dropped-the-elimination-chamber-ppv|title=Stephanie McMahon Reveals the Real Reason Why WWE Dropped the Elimination Chamber PPV|last=Paglino|first=Nick|date=January 15, 2015|website=Wrestlezone|publisher=Evolve Media|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the Elimination Chamber event returned (2017's event was SmackDown-exclusive while 2018's was Raw-exclusive). In addition, the chamber structure was redesigned, becoming square instead of circular. The pods were also changed from circular to square and feature sliding doors that referees slide open from outside the chamber. At the top of the chamber at its center which is now {{convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall is a large cutout of the WWE logo. The steel grates between the ring and the cage were also replaced with padding. LED lights also line the corners of the structure. The redesign was for practical purposes due to certain venues only being able to house the previous structure, allowing most venues to host the Chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/how-the-new-wwe-elimination-chamber-design-compares-compared-to-old-previous-one-photos-dimensions/|title=How the New WWE Elimination Chamber Design Compares to the Old One|date=February 12, 2017|last=Morrow|first=Brendan|work=[[Heavy.com]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Variations ===\nThe fifth match, held by the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]], was a slight variation called the [[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme]] Elimination Chamber.<ref name=\"ECWChamber\">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/decembertodismember/matches/32934421/results/|accessdate=2 February 2008|title=Mission Accomplished|last=Tello| first=Craig|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=3 December 2006}}</ref> In this variation, each chamber had one of four [[foreign object (professional wrestling)|weapons]] for the competitors locked inside to hold on to.

Both team members were inside of their respective pods, for a total of six tag teams in the match. This match was for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]]. This variation was repeated in 2019, but for women and to determine the inaugural holders of the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]].\n\nThe 2018 Elimination Chamber featured the first seven-man chamber match. Due to the extra person, three competitors started the match instead of two. The 2018 event also featured the first women's chamber match, but there were no variations in the rules.\n\n=== Interference ===\nDespite the structure, interference has become common inside the Elimination Chamber. At [[New Year's Revolution (2005)|New Year's Revolution]] in January 2005, [[Ric Flair]] distracted guest referee [[Shawn Michaels]]. allowing [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] who had been eliminated to attack [[Randy Orton]] so [[Triple H]] could win the match. At [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]] in February 2009, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] attacked [[Kofi Kingston]] during his entrance and locked himself in one of the pods becoming a participant in the match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] after losing the [[WWE Championship]] earlier in the night. At [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2010, [[Cody Rhodes]] passed [[Ted DiBiase Jr.]] a metal pipe which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the chamber to cost [[The Undertaker]] his World Heavyweight Championship to [[Chris Jericho]]. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2013)|Elimination Chamber]] event in February 2013, [[Mark Henry]] took out the remaining participants in the chamber for a World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania 29]] after being eliminated until [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] General Manager [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] broke it up. At the [[Elimination Chamber (2014)|Elimination Chamber]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] in February 2014, [[The Wyatt Family]] interfered by attacking [[John Cena]], leading to his eventual elimination  by Randy Orton. [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] would then come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the chamber, but would then interfere to cost [[Daniel Bryan]] the match to Orton.\n\n=== Match history ===\nThe Elimination Chamber debuted at WWE's event [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/10-best-elimination-chamber-matches|title=Which brutal Elimination Chamber Match stands above the rest?|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Since the inaugural match, there have been 25 other matches (26 overall) as of [[Elimination Chamber (2020)|Elimination Chamber]] in March 2020. The [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand has been featured the most with twelve matches, including its [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|joint-branded match]] with [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] has been featured in two matches, including its [[No Way Out (2008)|joint-branded match]] with SmackDown. The SmackDown brand has been featured in eight matches, including the joint-branded matches with both ECW and Raw. The [[WWE Elimination Chamber|Elimination Chamber]] event has featured more Elimination Chamber matches than any other [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|WWE pay-per-view event]], with seventeen matches being held. [[Triple H]] has the most number of victories with four. [[Chris Jericho]] holds the distinctions of being involved in the most number of Elimination Chamber matches to date (8) and eliminating the most wrestlers (10).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/by-the-numbers|title=Elimination Chamber: by the numbers|website=WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> [[Braun Strowman]] and [[Shayna Baszler]] have the most eliminations in a single Elimination Chamber match (5); Baszler is also the only winner to eliminate all other opponents in a single match.\n\nThe majority of matches have been contested for a top-tier championship with the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[WWE Championship]] (once as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship) being contested for the most in seven matches each and the [[ECW World Championship]], [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]], [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], and [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] being contested in one match each. Six matches (two in 2008 and one in 2011, 2013, 2018, and 2020) awarded the winners the number-one contendership for the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, [[WWE Universal Championship]], and Raw Women's Championship, respectively, at those years' [[WrestleMania]]. The Elimination Chamber match has been contested only in [[indoor arena]]s in the United States and once in Puerto Rico. From 2008 to 2014, the match had been featured in February pay-per-view events only. An Elimination Chamber pay-per-view event took place on May 31, 2015 exclusively on the [[WWE Network]]. The [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2018 featured the first seven-man Elimination Chamber match as well as the first Elimination Chamber match for women with the Raw Women's Championship contested. The [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|Elimination Chamber]] in February 2019 featured a tag team Elimination Chamber match, the second overall tag team chamber match, but this time for women to determine the inaugural holders of the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FBB; width:2em\"|\n|[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]]\n|style=\"background:#BBF; width:2em\"|\n|[[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown brand]]\n|style=\"background:#DDD; width:2em\"|\n|[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]]\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=\"1%\"|Number\n!width=\"5\"%|Brand\n!width=\"19%\"|Prize\n!width=\"30%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Result\n!width=\"10%\"|Date\n!width=\"12%\"|Event\n!width=\"10%\"|Location\n!width=\"1%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n!width=\"1%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Length\n|-\n|{{sort|01|1}}\n|style=\"background-color: #FBB;\" align=\"center\"|[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]\n|style=\"background-color: #FBB;\" align=\"center\"|[[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]\n|style=\"background-color: #FBB;\" align=\"center\"|[[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Triple H]] (c), [[Chris Jericho]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Rob Van Dam]]\n|{{dts|2002|11|17}}\n|[[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]\n|[[New York City|New York City, New York]]\n|<ref name=\"Survivor Series 2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2002/mainevent/ |accessdate=3 February 2008 |title=Survivor Series 2002 \u2013 Elimination Chamber match |publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221171201/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2002/mainevent/ |archivedate=21 February 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1037591979.shtml|title=Full WWE Survivor Series Results -

Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be \"modelling\".\n\nTypes of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television. Fashion models are sometimes featured in films (''[[Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter (film)|Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter]]'' and ''[[Looker]]''); [[Reality television|reality TV]] shows (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''); and music videos (\"[[Freedom!

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models.

The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on site; models under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult chaperone; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the [[child model]]'s gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Darwell|first=Robert A.|author2=Theodore C.

Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives. It was a societal statement, a political statement, and an economic one\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/style/tyra-banks-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue.html|title=At 45, Tyra Banks Is Back on the Cover of Sports Illustrated|last=Trebay|first=Guy|date=May 8, 2019|website=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> Now, models like [[Joan Smalls]], [[Winnie Harlow|Winne Harlow]], [[Slick Woods]], [[Jasmine Sanders]] and more are continuing the fight for black presence in the modeling world and using their successors as inspiration.\n\n=== Fit models ===\n{{Main|Fit model}}\nA fit model works as a sort of live mannequin to give designers and pattern makers feedback on the fit, feel, movement, and drape of a garment to be produced in a given size.\n\n===Glamour models===\n{{Main|Glamour photography}}\n[[File:Glamour Models on Red Carpet.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Glamour models posing on the red carpet \u2014 Hollywood, California]]\nGlamour modelling focuses on sexuality and thus general requirements are often unclear, being dependent more on each individual case. Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features.

The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names.

The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s.

Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world.

Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model.

The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue.

Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway.

Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world.

However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands.
