The team won the Saskatchewan Junior championships that year, earning the rink the right to represent Saskatchewan at the [[2011 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]]. At the Canadian Juniors, the team- which also included [[Kirk Muyres]] and [[Matt Lang]]- went undefeated (12-0) through the round robin, and proceeded to win the event by defeating Ontario's [[Mathew Camm]] in the final. The team would go on to represent Canada at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]] where they would find less success. The team found themselves in 4th place after the round robin with a 6-3 record. The team beat Norway ([[Steffen Mellemseter]]) in their first playoff match, but in the semi-final they lost to Switzerland ([[Peter de Cruz]]), and then lost to Norway again in the bronze medal game. After the World Juniors, the team played in their first [[Grand Slam of Curling|Grand Slam]] event, the [[2011 Players' Championship]] where they surprised many by making into the quarterfinals. After the season, Moskowy and Muyres graduated from the junior level. Lang and Flasch remained together, with Lang at skip and Flasch at second. They added [[Tyler Hartung]] and [[Jayden Shwaga]].\n\n==Men's career==\nFollowing juniors, Flasch joined the [[Steve Laycock]] rink at second, rejoining his former junior teammate, Kirk Muyres who is third on the team. Kirk's brother [[Dallan Muyres|Dallan]] would play lead. In Flasch's first season with the Laycock rink, the team would play in all four Grand Slam events, making it to the semi-finals of the [[2012 The Masters Grand Slam of Curling|2012 Masters of Curling]]. At the [[2013 SaskTel Tankard|2013 provincial men's championship]], the team finished 4th. Following the season, the team had accumulated enough [[CCA ranking|CTRS points]] to qualify for the [[2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials \u2013 Road to the Roar|\"Road to the Roar\" 2013 Canadian Olympic pre-qualifying event]]. At the \"Road to the Roar\" the following season, the team placed fourth, which was not good enough to qualify for the [[2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]].\n\nThe Laycock rink would win the [[2014 SaskTel Tankard]] men's provincial championship, sending the team to the [[2014 Tim Hortons Brier]], Flasch's first. At the Brier, the team narrowly missed the playoffs, after finishing the round robin with a 6-5 record.\n\nIn the [[2014-15 curling season]], the team had their best year yet finishing the season 4th on the [[World Curling Tour]]'s money list. The team qualified in the first three [[Grand Slam of Curling|Grand Slams]] with a runner up finish to Team [[Brad Gushue|Gushue]] at the [[2014 Canadian Open of Curling]]. The Laycock team [[2015 SaskTel Tankard|repeated]] as Saskatchewan champions, and would represent Saskatchewan at the [[2015 Tim Hortons Brier]]. There, they finished the round robin with an 8-4 record finishing 3rd in the round robin. They would lose the 3 vs. 4 game to Team Canada, but would go on to win the bronze medal.\n\nThey Laycock rink won the [[2016 SaskTel Tankard]] and represented Saskatchewan at the [[2016 Tim Hortons Brier]]. There, they finished out of the playoffs with a 5-6 record.\n\nAfter the team lost in the final of the [[2017 SaskTel Tankard]], Flasch announced he was leaving the Laycock rink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegrandslamofcurling.com/curling/colton-flasch-stepping-away-from-team-laycock/|title=Colton Flasch stepping away from Team Laycock|website=Grand Slam of Curling|access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> For the [[2017-18 curling season]], Flasch formed a new team of [[Kevin Marsh (curler)|Kevin Marsh]], [[Daniel Marsh (curler)|Daniel Marsh]] and [[Trent Knapp]], with Flasch skipping the team. His new team would win one tour event, the 2017 [[College Clean Restoration Curling Classic]]. This qualified them for the season-ending [[2018 Humpty's Champions Cup]], their lone slam of the season, where they would lose in a tiebreaker. The team played in the [[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials#Pre-trials|2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Pre-Trials]], where they finished with a 2-4 record, missing the playoffs. At the [[2018 SaskTel Tankard]], Flacsh led his team all the way to the finals, where he lost to his former skip, Steve Laycock. In March 2018, it was announced that Flasch would be joining the Koe rink for the [[2018-19 curling season]], and would play second on the team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nsnews.com/cmlink/gmg-glacier-media-group/kevin-koe-recruits-former-mcewen-third-neufeld-flasch-to-curling-team-1.23206989|title=Kevin Koe recruits Neufeld and Flasch to curling team|website=North Shore News|access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter joining the Edmonton based team of [[Kevin Koe]], [[B.

In provincial playdowns, the Koe rink lost two of their first three games at the [[2019 Boston Pizza Cup]], before winning five straight games to claim the Alberta championship. The team represented Alberta at the [[2019 Tim Hortons Brier]], and went undefeated in the entire tournament en route to winning his first Brier title. They went on to represent Canada at the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship]], finishing the round robin with a 9-3 record. They battled through the playoffs to play Team Sweden's [[Niklas Edin]] rink in the final, losing 7-2. In Grand Slam play, the team failed to win any slams, but did make it to three finals.

The team won the Saskatchewan Junior championships that year, earning the rink the right to represent Saskatchewan at the [[2011 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]]. At the Canadian Juniors, the team- which also included [[Kirk Muyres]] and [[Matt Lang]]- went undefeated (12-0) through the round robin, and proceeded to win the event by defeating Ontario's [[Mathew Camm]] in the final. The team would go on to represent Canada at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]] where they would find less success. The team found themselves in 4th place after the round robin with a 6-3 record. The team beat Norway ([[Steffen Mellemseter]]) in their first playoff match, but in the semi-final they lost to Switzerland ([[Peter de Cruz]]), and then lost to Norway again in the bronze medal game. After the World Juniors, the team played in their first [[Grand Slam of Curling|Grand Slam]] event, the [[2011 Players' Championship]] where they surprised many by making into the quarterfinals. After the season, Moskowy and Muyres graduated from the junior level. Lang and Flasch remained together, with Lang at skip and Flasch at second. They added [[Tyler Hartung]] and [[Jayden Shwaga]].\n\n==Men's career==\nFollowing juniors, Flash joined the [[Steve Laycock]] rink at second, rejoining his former junior teammate, Kirk Muyres who is third on the team. Kirk's brother [[Dallan Muyres|Dallan]] would play lead. In Flasch's first season with the Laycock rink, the team would play in all four Grand Slam events, making it to the semi-finals of the [[2012 The Masters Grand Slam of Curling|2012 Masters of Curling]]. At the [[2013 SaskTel Tankard|2013 provincial men's championship]], the team finished 4th. Following the season, the team had accumulated enough [[CCA ranking|CTRS points]] to qualify for the [[2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials \u2013 Road to the Roar|\"Road to the Roar\" 2013 Canadian Olympic pre-qualifying event]]. At the \"Road to the Roar\" the following season, the team placed fourth, which was not good enough to qualify for the [[2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]].\n\nThe Laycock rink would win the [[2014 SaskTel Tankard]] men's provincial championship, sending the team to the [[2014 Tim Hortons Brier]], Flasch's first. At the Brier, the team narrowly missed the playoffs, after finishing the round robin with a 6-5 record.\n\nIn the [[2014-15 curling season]], the team had their best year yet finishing the season 4th on the [[World Curling Tour]]'s money list. The team qualified in the first three [[Grand Slam of Curling|Grand Slams]] with a runner up finish to Team [[Brad Gushue|Gushue]] at the [[2014 Canadian Open of Curling]]. The Laycock team [[2015 SaskTel Tankard|repeated]] as Saskatchewan champions, and would represent Saskatchewan at the [[2015 Tim Hortons Brier]]. There, they finished the round robin with an 8-4 record finishing 3rd in the round robin. They would lose the 3 vs. 4 game to Team Canada, but would go on to win the bronze medal.\n\nThey Laycock rink won the [[2016 SaskTel Tankard]] and represented Saskatchewan at the [[2016 Tim Hortons Brier]]. There, they finished out of the playoffs with a 5-6 record.\n\nAfter the team lost in the final of the [[2017 SaskTel Tankard]], Flasch announced he was leaving the Laycock rink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegrandslamofcurling.com/curling/colton-flasch-stepping-away-from-team-laycock/|title=Colton Flasch stepping away from Team Laycock|website=Grand Slam of Curling|access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> For the [[2017-18 curling season]], Flasch formed a new team of [[Kevin Marsh (curler)|Kevin Marsh]], [[Daniel Marsh (curler)|Daniel Marsh]] and [[Trent Knapp]], with Flasch skipping the team. His new team would win one tour event, the 2017 [[College Clean Restoration Curling Classic]]. This qualified them for the season-ending [[2018 Humpty's Champions Cup]], their lone slam of the season, where they would lose in a tiebreaker. The team played in the [[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials#Pre-trials|2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Pre-Trials]], where they finished with a 2-4 record, missing the playoffs. At the [[2018 SaskTel Tankard]], Flacsh led his team all the way to the finals, where he lost to his former skip, Steve Laycock. In March 2018, it was announced that Flasch would be joining the Koe rink for the [[2018-19 curling season]], and would play second on the team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nsnews.com/cmlink/gmg-glacier-media-group/kevin-koe-recruits-former-mcewen-third-neufeld-flasch-to-curling-team-1.23206989|title=Kevin Koe recruits Neufeld and Flasch to curling team|website=North Shore News|access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter joining the Edmonton based team of [[Kevin Koe]], [[B.

In provincial playdowns, the Koe rink lost two of their first three games at the [[2019 Boston Pizza Cup]], before winning five straight games to claim the Alberta championship. The team represented Alberta at the [[2019 Tim Hortons Brier]], and went undefeated in the entire tournament en route to winning his first Brier title. They went on to represent Canada at the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship]], finishing the round robin with a 9-3 record. They battled through the playoffs to play Team Sweden's [[Niklas Edin]] rink in the final, losing 7-2. In Grand Slam play, the team failed to win any slams, but did make it to three finals. Despite the lack of any event wins, their strong play was good enough to award them with the Pinty's Cup for the season's best Slam team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/curling/koe-reaches-players-championship-final-clinch-pintys-cup/|title=Koe reaches Players' Championship Final Clinch Pinty's Cup|website=Sportsnet|access-date=August 27, 2019}}</ref> The team ended the season in the [[2018\u201319 Curling World Cup \u2013 Grand Final|Grand Final]] of the Curling World Cup, where they beat the host Chinese team ([[Zou Qiang]]).

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"A '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory|Paris Conservatory]], where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\"\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in Naples.\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory took over the entire curriculum of the child apprentices in Naples but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n \n\"In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition.\" Monuments of Partimento. The 19th  composers did their best to avoid the many cliches of the partimento school  \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"A '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory|Paris Conservatory]], where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\"\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in Naples.\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory took over the entire curriculum of the child apprentices in Naples but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n \n\"In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition.\" Monuments of Partimento \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes appear in a fifth [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and, for performances of some modern compositions, [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]].\n\nA full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a '''{{vanchor|symphony orchestra}}''' or '''philharmonic orchestra''' (''phil-'', Greek for \"loving\" + \"harmonic\"). The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. A ''{{vanchor|chamber orchestra}}'' (sometimes ''concert orchestra'') is a smaller-sized ensemble of about fifty musicians or fewer.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Orchestras that specialize in the [[Baroque music]] of, for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], or [[Classical music period|Classical]] repertoire, such as that of [[Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a [[Romantic music]] repertoire,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} such as the [[symphonies]] of [[Johannes Brahms]]. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of [[Richard Wagner]], and later, [[Gustav Mahler]].\n\nOrchestras are usually led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a [[conductor's baton]]. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the [[tempo]] and shapes the sound of the ensemble.<ref>{{cite book|section=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=Michael Kennedy & Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0-19-920383-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref> The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.\n\nThe leader of the first violin section, commonly called the [[concertmaster]], also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the [[Baroque music]] era (1600\u20131750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the [[basso continuo]] parts on a [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]], a tradition that some 20th-century and 21st-century [[early music]] ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] [[overture]]s, [[concerto]]s for solo instruments, and as [[pit orchestra|pit ensembles]] for [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, and some types of [[musical theatre]] (e.g., [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[operetta]]s).\n\nAmateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, [[youth orchestra]]s, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.\n\nThe term ''orchestra'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f40\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''orchestra''), the name for the area in front of a stage in [[ancient Greek theatre]] reserved for the [[Greek chorus]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rxh%2Fstra \u1f40\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019|reason=Orchestras obviously did not spring full-grown from the bow of Zeus in 1815}}\n\n===Instrumental technology===\n[[File:Philadelphia Orchestra at American premiere of Mahler's 8th Symphony (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Leopold Stokowski|Stokowski]] and the Philadelphia Orchestra at the March 2, 1916 American premiere of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony of a Thousand|8th Symphony]].]]\nThe invention of the piston and rotary valve by [[Heinrich St\u00f6lzel]] and [[Friedrich Bl\u00fchmel]], both [[Silesians]], in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by [[Theobald Boehm]] and the innovations of [[Adolphe Sax]] in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the [[saxophone]]. These advances would lead [[Hector Berlioz]] to write a landmark book on [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.<ref>Hector Berlioz. ''Traite d'instrumentation et d'orchestration'' (Paris: Lemoine, 1843).</ref>\n\n===Wagner's influence===\nThe next major expansion of symphonic practice came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work ''On Conducting''.<ref>Richard Wagner. ''On Conducting (Ueber das Dirigiren), a treatise on style in the execution of classical music'' (London: W. Reeves, 1887).</ref> This brought about a revolution in orchestral [[Musical composition|composition]], and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner's theories re-examined the importance of [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra.\n\n===20th-century orchestra===\nAs the early 20th century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of [[Gustav Mahler]] was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No.&nbsp;8]], Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be \"fixed\" by audio editing or [[overdubbing]]. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply \"getting through\" the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.<ref>See Lance W. Brunner. (1986). \"The Orchestra and Recorded Sound\", pp.&nbsp;479\u2013532 in Joan Peyser Ed. ''The Orchestra: Origins and Transformations'', New York: Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\n[[File:Ancasta-LaViottiChamberOrchestraMozartKV136.ogv|thumb|upright=1.25|Viotti Chamber Orchestra performing the 3rd movement of [[Mozart]]'s ''Divertimento in [[D Major]]'' (K136)]]\n\nThe typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related [[musical instrument]]s called the [[woodwind section|woodwinds]], [[brass section|brass]], [[percussion section|percussion]], and [[string section|strings]]. Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and [[electronic music|electric and electronic]] instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.\n\nIn the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period<ref>Jack Westrup, \"Instrumentation and Orchestration: 3. 1750 to 1800\", New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed., edited by Stanley Sadie (New York: Grove, 2001).</ref> and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s influence on the classical model.<ref>D. Kern Holoman, \"Instrumentation and Orchestration: 4. 19th Century\", in ibid.</ref> In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed [[electric instrument|electric]] and [[electronic instrument]]s in various combinations.\n\nThe terms ''symphony orchestra'' and ''philharmonic orchestra'' may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.\n\n''Chamber orchestra'' usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term ''concert orchestra'' may also be used, as in the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and the [[RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra]].\n\n===Beethoven's influence===\nThe so-called \"standard complement\" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The [[composer]]'s instrumentation almost always included paired [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[French horn|horns]] and [[trumpet]]s. The exceptions to this are his [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 4]], [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]], and [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 4]], which each specify a single [[flute]]. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular [[timbral]] \"palette\" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|\"Eroica\"]] Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of \"choral\" brass in the Trio movement. [[Piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s add to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth]], also known as the ''Pastoral Symphony''. The [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]] asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the \"Eroica\" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\u2014plus [[choir|chorus]] and vocal soloists\u2014in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Expanded instrumentation===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nApart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally.<ref>G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, \"Instrumentation and Orchestration: 5. Impression and Later Developments\", in ibid.</ref> These include the [[flugelhorn]] and [[cornet]]. [[Saxophone]]s and [[classical guitar]]s, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]], [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked \"tenor tuba\", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]]. Unless these instruments are played by members \"doubling\" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to [[contrabassoon]] for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular ensemble.\n\nThe 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.<ref>G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit.</ref> In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and [[sound effect]] such as the [[wind machine]]. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of [[contemporary classical music]], instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add [[electric instrument]]s such as [[electric guitar]], [[electronic instrument]]s such as [[synthesizer]]s, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).\n\nWith this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five eras: the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], the [[Classical music period|Classical era]], early/mid-[[Romantic music]] era, late-Romantic era and combined [[Modernism (music)|Modern/Postmodern eras]]. The first is a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestra (i.e., [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Vivaldi]]), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the [[basso continuo]] group (e.g., [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] and assorted bass instruments to perform the [[bassline]]), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early [[Beethoven]] along with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]), which used a smaller group of performers than a [[Romantic music]] orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Brahms]]); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th-century orchestra (e.g., [[Wagner]], [[Mahler]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., [[John Adams (composer)|Adams]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]).\n\n====Late Baroque orchestra====\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n;[[woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]:\n:2 [[flute]]s\n:2\u20133

Every instrumental group (or section) has a '''principal''' who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an [[accompaniment]] part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the [[concertmaster]] (or \"leader\" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the [[Conducting|conductor]]. The concertmaster leads the pre-concert [[musical tuning|tuning]] and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.\n\nThe principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.<ref>{{cite journal|title=An Investigation of Members' Roles in Wind Quintets |journal=Psychology of Music |volume=31 |pages=53\u201374 |date=2003-01-01 |doi=10.1177/0305735603031001323 |last1=Ford |first1=Luan |last2=Davidson |first2=Jane W. }}</ref> Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a [[tutti]] part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.\n\nA section string player plays in [[unison]] with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (''divisi'') parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to \"outside\" (nearer the audience) and \"inside\" seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.\n\nIn modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a [[Conducting|conductor]], although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the [[concertmaster]] or the [[harpsichord]]ist playing the [[Basso Continuo|continuo]]. Some modern orchestras also do [[Conductorless orchestra|without conductors]], particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called \"period\") performances of [[baroque music|baroque]] and earlier music.\n\nThe most frequently performed repertoire for a [[symphony]] orchestra is Western [[European classical music|classical music]] or [[opera]]. However, orchestras are used sometimes in [[popular music]] (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in [[film music]], and increasingly often in [[video game music]]. Orchestras are also used in the [[symphonic metal]] genre. The term \"orchestra\" can also be applied to a [[jazz ensemble]], for example in the performance of [[big band|big-band]] music.\n\n===Selection and appointment of members===\nIn the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally [[audition]] for positions in the ensemble.<!--Personal friends of the conductor and pals of principal players are exempted from this rule :)--> Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a [[concerto]], a solo [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[concertmaster]], the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying, and possibly other principal players.\n\nThe most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to [[sight read]] orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.\n\nThere are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, [[tenure]]d positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a \"sub\". Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on [[parental leave]] or [[disability]] leave.\n\n====Sex of ensembles====\nHistorically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians. The first [[women in music|female members hired in professional orchestras]] have been [[harp]]ists. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the world\u2019s top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008).<ref name=\"The world\u2019s greatest orchestras\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref> The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].<ref>[[James R.

They may be students from a music class or program or they may be drawn from the entire school body. School orchestras are typically led by a [[music teacher]].\n* University or conservatory orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from a university or music conservatory. In some cases, university orchestras are open to all students from a university, from all programs. Larger universities may have two or more university orchestras: one or more orchestras made up of music majors (or, for major music programs, several tiers of music major orchestras, ranked by skill level) and a second orchestra open to university students from all academic programs (e.g., science, business, etc.) who have previous classical music experience on an orchestral instrument. University and conservatory orchestras are led by a conductor who is typically a [[professor]] or instructor at the university or conservatory.\n* [[Youth orchestra]]s: These orchestras consist of teens and young adults drawn from an entire city or region. The age range in youth orchestras varies between different ensembles. In some cases, youth orchestras may consist of teens or young adults from an entire country (e.g., Canada's National Youth Orchestra).\n* Community orchestras: These orchestras consist of amateur performers drawn from an entire city or region. Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians. Community orchestras range in level from beginner-level orchestras which rehearse music without doing formal performances in front of an audience to intermediate-level ensembles to advanced amateur groups which play standard professional orchestra repertoire. In some cases, university or conservatory music students may also be members of community orchestras. While community orchestra members are mostly unpaid amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.\n\n==Repertoire and performances==\nOrchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century [[Baroque music#Dance suite|dance suites]], 18th-century [[divertimento]]s to 20th-century [[film score]]s and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the [[symphony]], an extended [[musical composition]] in Western [[classical music]] that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a [[Full score|musical score]], which contains all the instrument parts. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]).\n\nOrchestras also perform [[overture]]s, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.<ref name=\"Blom 1954\">Blom 1954.</ref> During the early Romantic era, composers such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the [[symphonic poem]], a form devised by [[Franz Liszt]] in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were \"at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme\".<ref name=\"Blom 1954\"/> In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.\n\nOrchestras also play with instrumental soloists in [[concerto]]s. During concertos, the orchestra plays an [[accompaniment]] role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.\n\n===Performances===\nIn the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasingly sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public [[concert hall]]s, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including [[sound recording]], [[radio broadcasting]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[Internet]]-based [[Streaming video|streaming]] and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.\n\n===Issues in performance===\n====Faking====\n{{Main|Faking (Western classical music)}}\nOne of the \"great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing\" is \"faking\", the process by which an orchestral musician gives the \"...impression of playing every note as written\", typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\">McVeigh, Alice. \"Faking it \u2013 the great unmentionable of orchestral playing\" in ''The Strad'', June 2006. http://www.thestrad.com/faking-it-the-great-unmentionable-of-orchestral-playing/</ref> An article in ''[[The Strad]]'' states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally \"fake\" certain passages.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/> One reason that musicians \"fake\" is because there are not enough rehearsals.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/> Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th-century and 21st-century contemporary pieces; some professionals said \"faking\" was \"necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/> Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking \"just because you haven\u2019t practised\" the music is not acceptable.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/>\n\n===Counter-revolution===\nWith the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], the [[London Classical Players]] under the direction of Sir [[Roger Norrington]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] under [[Christopher Hogwood]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Recent trends in the United States===\nIn the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments and\u2014more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras\u2014orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. While government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic falling-off of revenues from recording, tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.\n\nU.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] (in April 2011), and the [[Louisville Orchestra]], in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the [[Northwest Chamber Orchestra]] in 2006, the [[Honolulu Orchestra]] in March 2011, the [[New Mexico Symphony Orchestra]] in April 2011, and the [[Syracuse Symphony]] in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.\n\nOne source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/arts/music/ronald-wilford-manager-of-legendary-maestros-dies-at-87.html | title=Ronald Wilford, Manager of Legendary Maestros, Dies at 87 | work=The New York Times | author=Michael Cooper | date=2015-06-13 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/03/cleveland_orchestra_plans_deep.html | title=Cleveland Orchestra plans 'deep' cuts; Welser-Most takes pay cut | work=Cleveland Plain Dealer | author=Zachary Lewis | date=2009-03-24 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-leonard-slatkin-20110821 | title=He conducts himself well through crises | work=Los Angeles Times | author=Donna Perlmutter | date=2011-08-21 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/april-25-osmo-vnsk-hires-on-to-rebuild-orchestra/256589871/ | title=Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 hires on to rebuild Minnesota Orchestra | work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune | author=Graydon Royce | date=2014-05-09 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref>  Music administrators such as [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic [[Greg Sandow]] has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st-century audiences immersed in popular culture.\n\nIt is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams' opera ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]''; [[Philip Glass]] and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the ''[[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Glass)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'' and the [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Glass)|Violin Concerto No. 2]].\n\nAlong with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the [[string section]], since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).\n\n==Role of conductor==\n{{Main|Conducting}}\n[[File:Taipei.apo-hsu.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|[[Apo Hsu]], using a [[baton (conducting)|baton]], conducts the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU Symphony Orchestra]] in Taipei, Taiwan]]\n\nConducting is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an orchestral or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and \"shape\" the phrasing where appropriate.<ref>{{cite book|quote=\"Conducting\"|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] and Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0-19-920383-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref> To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.<ref name=CambComp3>Holden, Raymond: \"The technique of conducting\", p. 3 in ''The Cambridge Companion to Conducting\" ed. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Bowen</ref> A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.<ref name=CambComp3/>\n\nThe conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with musical theatre [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \"count in\"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\n\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |title=About.com: The Conductor |accessdate=2016-08-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2013 }}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.\n\n===Conductorless orchestras===\n{{Main|Conductorless orchestra}}\nIn the [[Baroque music]] era (1600\u20131750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the [[concertmaster]]. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the [[basso continuo]] part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a [[harpsichord]] player, a [[pipe organ]]ist or a [[lute]]ist or [[theorbo]] player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a [[ritard]] during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined [[choir]]s and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the [[Classical music period]] (ca. 1720\u20131800), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.\n\nIn 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-[[revolution]]ary [[Soviet Union]]. The symphony orchestra [[Persimfans]] was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal [[Marxism|Marxist]] state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a [[committee]], which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing [[tempo]] during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.<ref>John Eckhard, \"Orchester ohne Dirigent\", ''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik'' 158, no. 2 (1997): 40\u201343.</ref>\n\nIn Western nations, some ensembles, such as the [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]], based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]], Amsterdam Sinfonietta & Candida Thompson and the [[New Century Chamber Orchestra]]. As well, as part of the [[early music]] movement, some 20th- and 21st-century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing [[basso continuo]] performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.\n\n===Multiple conductors===\n====Offstage instruments====\nSome orchestral works specify that an [[offstage trumpet]] should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of \"[[Neptune]]\" from [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a [[video camera]] pointed at the principal conductor and a [[closed-circuit TV]] set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.\n\n====Contemporary music====\nThe techniques of [[polystylism]] and polytempo<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |title=Polytempo Music Articles |publisher=Greschak.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020820130701/http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |archivedate=2002-08-20 |df= }}</ref> music have led a few 20th- and 21st-century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously.  These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians.  Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In [[Percy Grainger]]'s \"[[The Warriors (Grainger)|The Warriors]]\" which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage [[brass ensemble]], and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late-century orchestral music is [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s [[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|''Gruppen'']], for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the \"sound masses\" could be spacialized, as in an [[electroacoustic work]]. ''Gruppen'' was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, [[Bruno Maderna]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It has been{{When|date=December 2015}}<!--Wasn't this almost twenty years ago?--> performed by [[Simon Rattle]], John Carewe and [[Daniel Harding]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Chinese orchestra]]\n* [[List of symphony orchestras]]\n** [[List of symphony orchestras in Europe]]\n** [[List of symphony orchestras in the United States]]\n* [[List of youth orchestras in the United States]]\n* [[Orchestral enhancement]]\n* [[Orchestration]]\n* [[Radio orchestra]]\n* [[Rhythm section]]\n* [[Shorthand for orchestra instrumentation]]\n* [[String orchestra]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last= Raynor |first= Henry |title= The Orchestra: A History |publisher= [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] |year= 1978 |isbn= 978-0-684-15535-7 }}\n* {{cite book |last= Sptizer |first= John, and Neil Zaslaw |title=The Birth of the Orchestra: History of an Institution, 1650\u20131815 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-816434-0 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Orchestras}}\n* [http://andrewhugill.com/manuals/ The Orchestra: A User's Manual]\u2014A fairly concise overview, including detailed video interviews with players of each instrument and various resources\n* [http://www.artsjournal.com/sandow/2011/09/my-book-improved.html Greg Sandow on the Future of Classical Music, Artsjournal.com blog, 25 September 2011]\n* [https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Instruments-of-the-Orchestra A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Instruments of the Orchestra]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Orchestra}}\n\n{{Orchestra}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Orchestras| ]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek theatre]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|Large instrumental ensemble}}\n[[File:Orquesta Filarmonica de Jalisco.jpg|thumb|The Jalisco Philharmonic Orchestra.]]\n[[File:Szczecin filharmonia (2).jpg|thumb|A modern orchestra concert hall: Philharmony in [[Szczecin]], Poland]]\n{{Music education|settings}}\nAn '''orchestra''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0254\u02d0r|k|\u026a|s|t|r|\u0259}}; {{IPA-it|or\u02c8k\u025bstra|lang}}) is a large [[Musical ensemble|instrumental ensemble]] typical of [[classical music]], which combines instruments from different families, including bowed [[string instrument]]s such as the [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]], [[Brass instrument|brass]] instruments such as the [[French horn|horn]], [[trumpet]], [[trombone]] and [[tuba]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] such as the [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]] and [[bassoon]], and [[percussion instrument]]s such as the [[timpani]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbals]], and [[Mallet percussion|mallet percussion instruments]] each grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes appear in a fifth [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and, for performances of some modern compositions, [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]].\n\nA full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a '''{{vanchor|symphony orchestra}}''' or '''philharmonic orchestra''' (''phil-'', Greek for \"loving\" + \"harmonic\"). The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. A ''{{vanchor|chamber orchestra}}'' (sometimes ''concert orchestra'') is a smaller-sized ensemble of about fifty musicians or fewer.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Orchestras that specialize in the [[Baroque music]] of, for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], or [[Classical music period|Classical]] repertoire, such as that of [[Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a [[Romantic music]] repertoire,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} such as the [[symphonies]] of [[Johannes Brahms]]. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of [[Richard Wagner]], and later, [[Gustav Mahler]].\n\nOrchestras are usually led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a [[conductor's baton]]. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the [[tempo]] and shapes the sound of the ensemble.<ref>{{cite book|section=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=Michael Kennedy & Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0-19-920383-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref> The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.\n\nThe leader of the first violin section, commonly called the [[concertmaster]], also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the [[Baroque music]] era (1600\u20131750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the [[basso continuo]] parts on a [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]], a tradition that some 20th-century and 21st-century [[early music]] ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] [[overture]]s, [[concerto]]s for solo instruments, and as [[pit orchestra|pit ensembles]] for [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, and some types of [[musical theatre]] (e.g., [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[operetta]]s).\n\nAmateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, [[youth orchestra]]s, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.\n\nThe term ''orchestra'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f40\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''orchestra''), the name for the area in front of a stage in [[ancient Greek theatre]] reserved for the [[Greek chorus]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rxh%2Fstra \u1f40\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019|reason=Orchestras obviously did not spring full-grown from the bow of Zeus in 1815}}\n\n===Instrumental technology===\n[[File:Philadelphia Orchestra at American premiere of Mahler's 8th Symphony (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Leopold Stokowski|Stokowski]] and the Philadelphia Orchestra at the March 2, 1916 American premiere of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony of a Thousand|8th Symphony]].]]\nThe invention of the piston and rotary valve by [[Heinrich St\u00f6lzel]] and [[Friedrich Bl\u00fchmel]], both [[Silesians]], in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by [[Theobald Boehm]] and the innovations of [[Adolphe Sax]] in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the [[saxophone]]. These advances would lead [[Hector Berlioz]] to write a landmark book on [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.<ref>Hector Berlioz. ''Traite d'instrumentation et d'orchestration'' (Paris: Lemoine, 1843).</ref>\n\n===Wagner's influence===\nThe next major expansion of symphonic practice came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work ''On Conducting''.<ref>Richard Wagner. ''On Conducting (Ueber das Dirigiren), a treatise on style in the execution of classical music'' (London: W. Reeves, 1887).</ref> This brought about a revolution in orchestral [[Musical composition|composition]], and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner's theories re-examined the importance of [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra.\n\n===20th-century orchestra===\nAs the early 20th century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of [[Gustav Mahler]] was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No.&nbsp;8]], Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be \"fixed\" by audio editing or [[overdubbing]]. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply \"getting through\" the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.<ref>See Lance W. Brunner. (1986). \"The Orchestra and Recorded Sound\", pp.&nbsp;479\u2013532 in Joan Peyser Ed. ''The Orchestra: Origins and Transformations'', New York: Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\n[[File:Ancasta-LaViottiChamberOrchestraMozartKV136.ogv|thumb|upright=1.25|Viotti Chamber Orchestra performing the 3rd movement of [[Mozart]]'s ''Divertimento in [[D Major]]'' (K136)]]\n\nThe typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related [[musical instrument]]s called the [[woodwind section|woodwinds]], [[brass section|brass]], [[percussion section|percussion]], and [[string section|strings]]. Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and [[electronic music|electric and electronic]] instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.\n\nIn the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period<ref>Jack Westrup, \"Instrumentation and Orchestration: 3. 1750 to 1800\", New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed., edited by Stanley Sadie (New York: Grove, 2001).</ref> and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s influence on the classical model.<ref>D. Kern Holoman, \"Instrumentation and Orchestration: 4. 19th Century\", in ibid.</ref> In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed [[electric instrument|electric]] and [[electronic instrument]]s in various combinations.\n\nThe terms ''symphony orchestra'' and ''philharmonic orchestra'' may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.\n\n''Chamber orchestra'' usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term ''concert orchestra'' may also be used, as in the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and the [[RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra]].\n\n===Beethoven's influence===\nThe so-called \"standard complement\" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The [[composer]]'s instrumentation almost always included paired [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[French horn|horns]] and [[trumpet]]s. The exceptions to this are his [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 4]], [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]], and [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 4]], which each specify a single [[flute]]. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular [[timbral]] \"palette\" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|\"Eroica\"]] Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of \"choral\" brass in the Trio movement. [[Piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s add to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth]], also known as the ''Pastoral Symphony''. The [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]] asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the \"Eroica\" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\u2014plus [[choir|chorus]] and vocal soloists\u2014in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Expanded instrumentation===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nApart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally.<ref>G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, \"Instrumentation and Orchestration: 5. Impression and Later Developments\", in ibid.</ref> These include the [[flugelhorn]] and [[cornet]]. [[Saxophone]]s and [[classical guitar]]s, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]], [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked \"tenor tuba\", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]]. Unless these instruments are played by members \"doubling\" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to [[contrabassoon]] for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular ensemble.\n\nThe 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.<ref>G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit.</ref> In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and [[sound effect]] such as the [[wind machine]]. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of [[contemporary classical music]], instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add [[electric instrument]]s such as [[electric guitar]], [[electronic instrument]]s such as [[synthesizer]]s, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).\n\nWith this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five eras: the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], the [[Classical music period|Classical era]], early/mid-[[Romantic music]] era, late-Romantic era and combined [[Modernism (music)|Modern/Postmodern eras]]. The first is a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestra (i.e., [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Vivaldi]]), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the [[basso continuo]] group (e.g., [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] and assorted bass instruments to perform the [[bassline]]), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early [[Beethoven]] along with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]), which used a smaller group of performers than a [[Romantic music]] orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Brahms]]); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th-century orchestra (e.g., [[Wagner]], [[Mahler]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., [[John Adams (composer)|Adams]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]).\n\n====Late Baroque orchestra====\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n;[[woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]:\n:2 [[flute]]s\n:2\u20133

Every instrumental group (or section) has a '''principal''' who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an [[accompaniment]] part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the [[concertmaster]] (or \"leader\" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the [[Conducting|conductor]]. The concertmaster leads the pre-concert [[musical tuning|tuning]] and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.\n\nThe principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.<ref>{{cite journal|title=An Investigation of Members' Roles in Wind Quintets |journal=Psychology of Music |volume=31 |pages=53\u201374 |date=2003-01-01 |doi=10.1177/0305735603031001323 |last1=Ford |first1=Luan |last2=Davidson |first2=Jane W. }}</ref> Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a [[tutti]] part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.\n\nA section string player plays in [[unison]] with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (''divisi'') parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to \"outside\" (nearer the audience) and \"inside\" seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.\n\nIn modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a [[Conducting|conductor]], although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the [[concertmaster]] or the [[harpsichord]]ist playing the [[Basso Continuo|continuo]]. Some modern orchestras also do [[Conductorless orchestra|without conductors]], particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called \"period\") performances of [[baroque music|baroque]] and earlier music.\n\nThe most frequently performed repertoire for a [[symphony]] orchestra is Western [[European classical music|classical music]] or [[opera]]. However, orchestras are used sometimes in [[popular music]] (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in [[film music]], and increasingly often in [[video game music]]. Orchestras are also used in the [[symphonic metal]] genre. The term \"orchestra\" can also be applied to a [[jazz ensemble]], for example in the performance of [[big band|big-band]] music.\n\n===Selection and appointment of members===\nIn the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally [[audition]] for positions in the ensemble.<!--Personal friends of the conductor and pals of principal players are exempted from this rule :)--> Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a [[concerto]], a solo [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[concertmaster]], the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying, and possibly other principal players.\n\nThe most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to [[sight read]] orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.\n\nThere are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, [[tenure]]d positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a \"sub\". Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on [[parental leave]] or [[disability]] leave.\n\n====Sex of ensembles====\nHistorically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians. The first [[women in music|female members hired in professional orchestras]] have been [[harp]]ists. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the world\u2019s top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008).<ref name=\"The world\u2019s greatest orchestras\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref> The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].<ref>[[James R.

They may be students from a music class or program or they may be drawn from the entire school body. School orchestras are typically led by a [[music teacher]].\n* University or conservatory orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from a university or music conservatory. In some cases, university orchestras are open to all students from a university, from all programs. Larger universities may have two or more university orchestras: one or more orchestras made up of music majors (or, for major music programs, several tiers of music major orchestras, ranked by skill level) and a second orchestra open to university students from all academic programs (e.g., science, business, etc.) who have previous classical music experience on an orchestral instrument. University and conservatory orchestras are led by a conductor who is typically a [[professor]] or instructor at the university or conservatory.\n* [[Youth orchestra]]s: These orchestras consist of teens and young adults drawn from an entire city or region. The age range in youth orchestras varies between different ensembles. In some cases, youth orchestras may consist of teens or young adults from an entire country (e.g., Canada's National Youth Orchestra).\n* Community orchestras: These orchestras consist of amateur performers drawn from an entire city or region. Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians. Community orchestras range in level from beginner-level orchestras which rehearse music without doing formal performances in front of an audience to intermediate-level ensembles to advanced amateur groups which play standard professional orchestra repertoire. In some cases, university or conservatory music students may also be members of community orchestras. While community orchestra members are mostly unpaid amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.\n\n==Repertoire and performances==\nOrchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century [[Baroque music#Dance suite|dance suites]], 18th-century [[divertimento]]s to 20th-century [[film score]]s and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the [[symphony]], an extended [[musical composition]] in Western [[classical music]] that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a [[Full score|musical score]], which contains all the instrument parts. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]).\n\nOrchestras also perform [[overture]]s, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.<ref name=\"Blom 1954\">Blom 1954.</ref> During the early Romantic era, composers such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the [[symphonic poem]], a form devised by [[Franz Liszt]] in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were \"at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme\".<ref name=\"Blom 1954\"/> In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.\n\nOrchestras also play with instrumental soloists in [[concerto]]s. During concertos, the orchestra plays an [[accompaniment]] role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.\n\n===Performances===\nIn the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasingly sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public [[concert hall]]s, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including [[sound recording]], [[radio broadcasting]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[Internet]]-based [[Streaming video|streaming]] and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.\n\n===Issues in performance===\n====Faking====\n{{Main|Faking (Western classical music)}}\nOne of the \"great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing\" is \"faking\", the process by which an orchestral musician gives the \"...impression of playing every note as written\", typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\">McVeigh, Alice. \"Faking it \u2013 the great unmentionable of orchestral playing\" in ''The Strad'', June 2006. http://www.thestrad.com/faking-it-the-great-unmentionable-of-orchestral-playing/</ref> An article in ''[[The Strad]]'' states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally \"fake\" certain passages.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/> One reason that musicians \"fake\" is because there are not enough rehearsals.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/> Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th-century and 21st-century contemporary pieces; some professionals said \"faking\" was \"necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/> Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking \"just because you haven\u2019t practised\" the music is not acceptable.<ref name=\"thestrad.com\"/>\n\n===Counter-revolution===\nWith the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], the [[London Classical Players]] under the direction of Sir [[Roger Norrington]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] under [[Christopher Hogwood]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Recent trends in the United States===\nIn the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments and\u2014more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras\u2014orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. While government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic falling-off of revenues from recording, tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.\n\nU.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] (in April 2011), and the [[Louisville Orchestra]], in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the [[Northwest Chamber Orchestra]] in 2006, the [[Honolulu Orchestra]] in March 2011, the [[New Mexico Symphony Orchestra]] in April 2011, and the [[Syracuse Symphony]] in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.\n\nOne source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/arts/music/ronald-wilford-manager-of-legendary-maestros-dies-at-87.html | title=Ronald Wilford, Manager of Legendary Maestros, Dies at 87 | work=The New York Times | author=Michael Cooper | date=2015-06-13 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/03/cleveland_orchestra_plans_deep.html | title=Cleveland Orchestra plans 'deep' cuts; Welser-Most takes pay cut | work=Cleveland Plain Dealer | author=Zachary Lewis | date=2009-03-24 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-leonard-slatkin-20110821 | title=He conducts himself well through crises | work=Los Angeles Times | author=Donna Perlmutter | date=2011-08-21 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/april-25-osmo-vnsk-hires-on-to-rebuild-orchestra/256589871/ | title=Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 hires on to rebuild Minnesota Orchestra | work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune | author=Graydon Royce | date=2014-05-09 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref>  Music administrators such as [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic [[Greg Sandow]] has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st-century audiences immersed in popular culture.\n\nIt is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams' opera ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]''; [[Philip Glass]] and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the ''[[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Glass)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'' and the [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Glass)|Violin Concerto No. 2]].\n\nAlong with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the [[string section]], since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).\n\n==Role of conductor==\n{{Main|Conducting}}\n[[File:Taipei.apo-hsu.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|[[Apo Hsu]], using a [[baton (conducting)|baton]], conducts the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU Symphony Orchestra]] in Taipei, Taiwan]]\n\nConducting is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an orchestral or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and \"shape\" the phrasing where appropriate.<ref>{{cite book|quote=\"Conducting\"|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] and Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0-19-920383-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref> To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.<ref name=CambComp3>Holden, Raymond: \"The technique of conducting\", p. 3 in ''The Cambridge Companion to Conducting\" ed. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Bowen</ref> A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.<ref name=CambComp3/>\n\nThe conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with musical theatre [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \"count in\"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\n\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |title=About.com: The Conductor |accessdate=2016-08-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2013 }}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.\n\n===Conductorless orchestras===\n{{Main|Conductorless orchestra}}\nIn the [[Baroque music]] era (1600\u20131750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the [[concertmaster]]. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the [[basso continuo]] part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a [[harpsichord]] player, a [[pipe organ]]ist or a [[lute]]ist or [[theorbo]] player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a [[ritard]] during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined [[choir]]s and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the [[Classical music period]] (ca. 1720\u20131800), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.\n\nIn 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-[[revolution]]ary [[Soviet Union]]. The symphony orchestra [[Persimfans]] was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal [[Marxism|Marxist]] state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a [[committee]], which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing [[tempo]] during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.<ref>John Eckhard, \"Orchester ohne Dirigent\", ''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik'' 158, no. 2 (1997): 40\u201343.</ref>\n\nIn Western nations, some ensembles, such as the [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]], based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]], Amsterdam Sinfonietta & Candida Thompson and the [[New Century Chamber Orchestra]]. As well, as part of the [[early music]] movement, some 20th- and 21st-century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing [[basso continuo]] performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.\n\n===Multiple conductors===\n====Offstage instruments====\nSome orchestral works specify that an [[offstage trumpet]] should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of \"[[Neptune]]\" from [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a [[video camera]] pointed at the principal conductor and a [[closed-circuit TV]] set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.\n\n====Contemporary music====\nThe techniques of [[polystylism]] and polytempo<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |title=Polytempo Music Articles |publisher=Greschak.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020820130701/http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |archivedate=2002-08-20 |df= }}</ref> music have led a few 20th- and 21st-century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously.  These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians.  Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In [[Percy Grainger]]'s \"[[The Warriors (Grainger)|The Warriors]]\" which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage [[brass ensemble]], and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late-century orchestral music is [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s [[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|''Gruppen'']], for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the \"sound masses\" could be spacialized, as in an [[electroacoustic work]]. ''Gruppen'' was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, [[Bruno Maderna]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It has been{{When|date=December 2015}}<!--Wasn't this almost twenty years ago?--> performed by [[Simon Rattle]], John Carewe and [[Daniel Harding]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Chinese orchestra]]\n* [[List of symphony orchestras]]\n** [[List of symphony orchestras in Europe]]\n** [[List of symphony orchestras in the United States]]\n* [[List of youth orchestras in the United States]]\n* [[Orchestral enhancement]]\n* [[Orchestration]]\n* [[Radio orchestra]]\n* [[Rhythm section]]\n* [[Shorthand for orchestra instrumentation]]\n* [[String orchestra]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last= Raynor |first= Henry |title= The Orchestra: A History |publisher= [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] |year= 1978 |isbn= 978-0-684-15535-7 }}\n* {{cite book |last= Sptizer |first= John, and Neil Zaslaw |title=The Birth of the Orchestra: History of an Institution, 1650\u20131815 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-816434-0 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Orchestras}}\n* [http://andrewhugill.com/manuals/ The Orchestra: A User's Manual]\u2014A fairly concise overview, including detailed video interviews with players of each instrument and various resources\n* [http://www.artsjournal.com/sandow/2011/09/my-book-improved.html Greg Sandow on the Future of Classical Music, Artsjournal.com blog, 25 September 2011]\n* [https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Instruments-of-the-Orchestra A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Instruments of the Orchestra]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Orchestra}}\n\n{{Orchestra}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Orchestras| ]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek theatre]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n", "name_user": "Jerome Kohl", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra"}
