The album sold over 6 million copies worldwide. The album has sold 565,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/features/ask-billboard-1000463343.story |title=Ask Billboard &#124; Billboard.com |work=billboard.com |accessdate=January 8, 2012|first=Keith|last=Barth}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nPrior to its 1994 release, ''Twelve Deadly Cyns'' had already gone through different titles and tracklists before a final release was settled. A Cyndi Lauper greatest-hits album had already been considered for release in the late 80s titled ''10 Deadly Cyns'' which included all worldwide singles from her first 2 albums (except \"[[Boy Blue (Cyndi Lauper song)|Boy Blue]]\") as well as \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\" and \"[[I Drove All Night]]\", with remixed versions of some songs and a live version of \"Money Changes Everything\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120090243/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=10dc</ref> However, since there is no known promotional release of ''10 Deadly Cyns'', its existence is debatable.\n\nA different greatest-hits album titled ''13 Deadly Cyns'' was considered for 1992 prior to the release of Cyndi's fourth album ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'', with a promo tape being released in the U.K. that year.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120090336/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=13dc</ref> This version of the album included all singles (worldwide and regional) from Cyndi's first three albums (except \"[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]\", \"Boy Blue\" and \"Primitive\") as well as her 1992 single \"The World is Stone\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120090336/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=13dc</ref> The shorter 7\" studio edit of \"Money Changes Everything\" was included on this promotional release instead of the album version which would appear on the final release.\n\nEventually, the album would finally be released in 1994 worldwide (except North America) with a total of 16 tracks in most countries. Most singles from Cyndi's first four albums were included with the exception of regional or limited release singles such as \"When You Were Mine\", \"[[Maybe He'll Know]]\", \"[[Heading West (song)|Heading West]]\", \"[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper song)|A Night to Remember]]\" and \"Primitive\". Despite receiving a release in most markets, \"Boy Blue\" was not included and the worldwide single \"[[My First Night Without You]]\" did not make it on the final tracklist either. A noticeable omission was Cyndi's 1985 U.S. Top 10 single \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\". Her other soundtrack singles \"The World is Stone\" and \"Hole in My Heart\" did make the final tracklist however (the latter only on the Japanese edition of the album). The compilation included 3 previously unreleased recordings; a reggae-influenced re-recording of Cyndi's debut single titled \"[[Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)]]\", a re-recording of \"[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]\" which had been released in 1980 as the debut single for [[Blue Angel (band)|Blue Angel]] and a brand new song titled \"[[Come On Home (Cyndi Lauper song)|Come on Home]]\" which Cyndi co-wrote with Jan Pulsford, who would work with Cyndi on much of her next album, 1996's ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]''.\n\n==Release==\nIn the United States the album has 14 tracks. 11 are previously released hits; \"[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]\" is a Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil track Lauper re-recorded, having previously performed it on her debut album ''[[Blue Angel (Blue Angel album)|Blue Angel]]''. \"(Hey Now) Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" is a re-recording of one of her biggest hits; it has been completely reworked to incorporate a reggae feel based on [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]]'s 1974 hit \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\" (for which Redbone member Lolly Vegas received a songwriting credit). A music video featuring [[drag queens]] was shot to accompany this single and it aired heavily on television. It was also featured in the film ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. The track \"Come on Home\" was also new; two versions were recorded, one running 4:33 (the US version) and one running 4:36 (the international version). Internationally the album has 16 tracks, including \"[[The World Is Stone]]\" and \"[[Who Let in the Rain]]\" which were not available on the U.S. release. The Japanese edition also included an additional 17th track \"[[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\".\n\nThere was some issue with the division of royalties due to the wide array of co-writers on the various tracks that prevented Lauper from releasing the longer version in the United States.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120104100/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=tdc</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review for [[Allmusic]], music critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] gave the album four out of five stars and said that it succeeds as a greatest hits collection, but felt that apart from \"True Colors\" and \"Change of Heart\", all of Lauper's best and most successful songs are already on ''[[She's So Unusual]]'', which he said is \"a more consistent and entertaining album.\"<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r206565|tab=review |label=\"Cyndi Lauper: ''12 Deadly Cyns...and Then Some'' > Review\" |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-10-10}}}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a \"C\" grade and similarly felt

A Cyndi Lauper greatest-hits album had already been considered for release in the late 80s titled ''10 Deadly Cyns'' which included all worldwide singles from her first 2 albums (except \"[[Boy Blue (Cyndi Lauper song)|Boy Blue]]\") as well as \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\" and \"[[I Drove All Night]]\", with remixed versions of some songs and a live version of \"Money Changes Everything\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120090243/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=10dc</ref> However, since there is no known promotional release of ''10 Deadly Cyns'', its existence is debatable.\n\nA different greatest-hits album titled ''13 Deadly Cyns'' was considered for 1992 prior to the release of Cyndi's fourth album ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'', with a promo tape being released in the U.K. that year.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120090336/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=13dc</ref> This version of the album included all singles (worldwide and regional) from Cyndi's first three albums (except \"[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]\", \"Boy Blue\" and \"Primitive\") as well as her 1992 single \"The World is Stone\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120090336/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=13dc</ref> The shorter 7\" studio edit of \"Money Changes Everything\" was included on this promotional release instead of the album version which would appear on the final release.\n\nEventually, the album would finally be released in 1994 worldwide (except North America) with a total of 16 tracks in most countries. Most singles from Cyndi's first four albums were included with the exception of regional or limited release singles such as \"When You Were Mine\", \"[[Maybe He'll Know]]\", \"[[Heading West (song)|Heading West]]\", \"[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper song)|A Night to Remember]]\" and \"Primitive\". Despite receiving a release in most markets, \"Boy Blue\" was not included and the worldwide single \"[[My First Night Without You]]\" did not make it on the final tracklist either. A noticeable omission was Cyndi's 1985 U.S. Top 10 single \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\". Her other soundtrack singles \"The World is Stone\" and \"Hole in My Heart\" did make the final tracklist however (the latter only on the Japanese edition of the album). The compilation included 3 previously unreleased recordings; a reggae-influenced re-recording of Cyndi's debut single titled \"[[Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)]]\", a re-recording of \"[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]\" which had been released in 1980 as the debut single for [[Blue Angel (band)|Blue Angel]] and a brand new song titled \"[[Come On Home (Cyndi Lauper song)|Come on Home]]\" which Cyndi co-wrote with Jan Pulsford, who would work with Cyndi on much of her next album, 1996's ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]''.\n\n==Release==\nIn the United States the album has 14 tracks. 11 are previously released hits; \"[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]\" is a Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil track Lauper re-recorded, having previously performed it on her debut album ''[[Blue Angel (Blue Angel album)|Blue Angel]]''. \"(Hey Now) Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" is a re-recording of one of her biggest hits; it has been completely reworked to incorporate a reggae feel based on [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]]'s 1974 hit \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\" (for which Redbone member Lolly Vegas received a songwriting credit). A music video featuring [[drag queens]] was shot to accompany this single and it aired heavily on television. It was also featured in the film ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. The track \"Come on Home\" was also new; two versions were recorded, one running 4:33 (the US version) and one running 4:36 (the international version). Internationally the album has 16 tracks, including \"[[The World Is Stone]]\" and \"[[Who Let in the Rain]]\" which were not available on the U.S. release. The Japanese edition also included an additional 17th track \"[[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\".\n\nThere was some issue with the division of royalties due to the wide array of co-writers on the various tracks that prevented Lauper from releasing the longer version in the United States.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031120104100/http://www.cyndilauper.com/album_det.php?shname=tdc</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review for [[Allmusic]], music critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] gave the album four out of five stars and said that it succeeds as a greatest hits collection, but felt that apart from \"True Colors\" and \"Change of Heart\", all of Lauper's best and most successful songs are already on ''[[She's So Unusual]]'', which he said is \"a more consistent and entertaining album.\"<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r206565|tab=review |label=\"Cyndi

It was released by [[S-Curve Records]] on June 10, 2003.  The album contains the [[power pop]] single \"[[Stacy's Mom]],\" which reached number 21 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the band's highest-charting hit in the United States.\n\n==Background==\nFountains of Wayne was at a low point following the under-performance of 1999's ''Utopia Parkway'', which led to them getting dropped by their then-label, [[Atlantic Records]]. The period when they were without a label was particularly hard on lead singer and co-songwriter [[Chris Collingwood]]. According to bassist and co-songwriter [[Adam Schlesinger]] in 2005, \"I think Chris felt especially bummed during that whole period. He just sort of felt that we worked for a really long time and it didn\u2019t really add up to anything. And it didn\u2019t seem like the future had much in the way of promise. Chris wasn\u2019t writing a lot. I don\u2019t know if it was the whole thing of being in between labels but more just the whole thing of putting all that time into it and feeling it tapering off.<ref name=Luerssen>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|publisher=American Songwriter|date=2007-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nEventually Schlesinger convinced Collingwood to start writing and recording \"because it was the only way that I could get Chris to want to be a part of it. I was just like, \u2018Hey look, let\u2019s just go in and do like we have always done when we were 18. If we have a song we like, we\u2019ll just record it and eventually we\u2019ll see if we have an album.\"<ref name=Luerssen /> By mid-2001, Fountains of Wayne had discussed plans for a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/fountains-of-wayne-1798208149|title=Fountains of Wayne|first=Stephen|last=Thompson|publisher=AV Club|date=2001-06-06|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the band got in touch with several prospective labels, but balked at their insistence that the band record demos for consideration to be signed. According to Schlesinger, \"We talked to a bunch of record companies before we had anything recorded. And everybody was like, \u2018Well we really like your band but we need to hear what you\u2019re working on. Do you have any demos or anything?\u2019 And we didn't want to make demos. We just found that kind of demeaning. But we were sort of at the point where we could have gone and made demos. And it was like, you know, for God's sake we\u2019ve been doing this so long, we\u2019re not going to make a demo tape.

{"title_page": "Paik system", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\nThe '''''Paik'' system''' was a type of [[corvee]] labour system on which the economy of the [[Ahom kingdom]] of medieval [[Assam]] depended. In this system, adult and able males, called ''paiks'' were obligated to render service to the state and form its militia in return for a piece of land for cultivation owned by the kingdom\u2014believed to be a legacy the Ahoms brought with them from [[South-Eastern Asia]] in 1228.<ref>\"It follows, then, that paddy lands belonged to the community, i.e. to the king as representative of the community. This medieval Thai practice is a key to the understanding of the Ahom system of land rights in Assam.\" {{harvcol|Guha|1966|p=222}}</ref> But it wasn't the Ahom kingdom alone that used a corvee system like this in [[Northeast India]]\u2014[[Manipur_(princely_state)|Kingdom of Manipur]] and in a simpler form [[Jaintia kingdom]] and the [[Kachari kingdom]] too used similar systems that had tribal origins.<ref>\"Despite some later modifications, the military-administrative system of the Ahoms remained essentially the same till 1826 and thus betrayed its tribal origin. It resembled very much that of medieval Thailand and also that of Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia.\" {{harvcol|Guha|1966|p=225}}</ref> The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1608, and extensively and exhaustively implemented by 1658 during the reign of [[Sutamla]] Jayadhwaj Singha.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions.  By the end of the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769\u20131805) the Paik system had collapsed.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=51}}</ref>\n\nThe Paik system has had a profound impact on Assam's social life, with many collective practices originating in the medieval times.  Many people in Assam today still carry the Paik offices titles in their last names\u2014''Bora'', ''Saikia'' and ''Hazarika''.  \n\n==''Paik'' system==\nEvery male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of sixteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a ''paik''.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The paiks were organized into four-member groups called ''got''s.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> Each ''got'' had to send one member by rotation for public works. During the absence of a paik the other members of the ''got'' took care of his lands and family. In times of war, the paiks formed the militia. All lands under rice cultivation belonged to the state. Originally, the paiks were organized into ''phoid''s (clans), but by the 17th century the paiks were re-grouped into divisions called ''khel''s.  According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of [[Rudra Singha]], around 1714.  The top [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]] was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class.\n\n===Land holdings===\nThe duty of a ''paik'' was to render service to the Ahom state in exchange for which he was granted 2 ''puras'' (2.66 acres) of [[usufruct]] cultivable land (''gaa mati''), which was neither hereditary nor transferable.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=35}}</ref>  In addition he could maintain his tax-free ancestral homestead and garden (''basti'' and ''bari'' respectively).  The nobility maintained personal estates called ''khats''.\n\nCultivable land called ''roopeet'' was held communally that was distributed among the ''paiks'' (called ''gaa mati'').  Wastelands reclaimed by ''paiks'' or non-''paiks'' not covered by a royal grant are subject to inclusion in the ''roopeet'' category to be distributed as ''gaa mati'' in the next ''paik'' survey. Surplus cultivable land was distributed as ''ubar mati'' among the ''paiks''.\n\n===Royal service===\nThe royal services that the ''paiks'' tended to were defense (the Ahom kingdom did not have a standing army till the beginning of 19th century and its army consisted of the [[militia]] formed of ''paiks''), civil construction (embankments, roads, bridges, tanks, etc.), military production (boats, arrows, muskets), etc. There were two major classes of ''paiks'': ''kanri paik'' (archer) who rendered his service as a soldier or as a laborer and ''chamua paik'' who rendered non-manual service and had a higher social standing.  Some other minor classes were: ''bilatiyas'' (tenants at the estates of nobles), ''dewaliyas'' (attached to temples and [[sattra]]s) and ''bahatiyas'' (attached to hill masters).  ''Kanri paiks'' could move up to ''chamua''.  Most of the lower paik officers&mdash;Bora, Saikia, Hazarika, Tamuli, Pachani&mdash;belonged to the ''chamua'' class.<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=17}}</ref>   \n \nAfter the first major survey recorded in the [[Buranji]]s which was taken in 1510 under [[Suhungmung]], the ''paiks'' were organized according to families and lineage called ''phoids'' and resettled according to their skills. The number of ''paiks'' rendering royal service at any time followed the principle of ''ghar muri e-powa'' or one-fourth the number of ''paiks'' in a household.  The ''paik'' rendering service was rotated and the other ''paiks'' in his household tended to his ''gaa mati'' during his absence.\n\nIn the 1609 restructuring by Momai Tamuli Borbarua the ''phoid'' organization was replaced by the ''got''.  A ''got'' consisted of four ''paiks'' who lived close together.  The ''paiks'' in a ''got'' were numbered ''mul'' (first), ''duwal'' (second), ''tewal'' (third), etc.  In times of peace, generally one of the ''paiks'' in a ''got'' rendered royal service at any given time. In times of war, a second or even a third ''paik'' from a ''got'' could be asked to render service simultaneously. As before, the ''gaa mati'' was tended to by the remaining ''paiks'' of the ''got''. This ensured that economic production did not suffer when a large section of the population was not involved in it and contributed to the resilience of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th to 18th century.\n\nDuring the time of [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1752\u20131789), as the pressure on the ''paik'' system increased, the number of ''paiks'' in each ''got'' was decreased from four to three.\n\n===Organization of the ''paiks''===\nThe ''paiks'' in their ''phoids'' were organized under ''khels'' according to the locality in which they belonged.  Momai Tamuli Borbarua reorganized many such ''khels'' functionally according to the specific service the ''paiks'' in the khel rendered.  Some of the ''khels'' were thus similar to professional or trade guilds.  The organization of the ''khel'' was extended later by his son [[Lachit Borphukan]] into self contained ones by incorporating ''paiks'' of different professions into each ''khel''.\n\n''Khels'' were further organized under a ''mel'' or a ''dagi''.  A group of such divisions was attached to  each of the three great Gohains, which is then called the ''hatimur'' of the particular ''Gohain''.  A second group of divisions was placed under the ''khel'' officers (''Phukan'', ''Rajkhowa'' and ''Barua'') that rendered service to members of the royal family.  The third and the largest group of ''dagis'', organized under ''khel'' officers, rendered service to the king or the state.\n\n===''Paik'' officials===\nThe ''paiks'' in a ''khel'' were organized under a gradation of officials who commanded a set number of them.  They were ''Bora'' (20 ''paiks''), ''Saikia'' (100) and ''Hazarika'' (1000).  More important ''khels'' were commanded by a ''Phukan'' (6000), a ''Rajkhowa'' (a governor of a territory), or a ''Barua'' (a superintending officer) each of whom could command between 2000 and 3000 ''paiks''.\n\nThe ''Phukans'', ''Rajkhowas'', ''Baruas'' and ''Hazarikas'' were nominated by the king and appointed in concurrence with the three great ''Gohains'' ([[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]] and [[Borpatrogohain]]). The ''Boras'' and ''Saikias'' were appointed by their respective ''Phukans'' and ''Rajkhowas''. The ''paiks'' had the right to reject a ''Bora'' or a ''Saikia'' and request another officer of their choice.\n\n''Kanri paiks'' could rise to become ''chamua paiks'' and then to higher ''paik'' officials.  Appointments were made irrespective of the ''paik'''s religion or ethnicity.\n\n===Ahom justice===\nThe Ahom justice system was also based on the ''Paik'' system.  Each ''Paik'' official offered justice to the ''paiks'' and each appeal was heard by the next higher officer in the ''khel'' system.  The system of appeals could go right up to the ''Nyayxodha Phukan''.\n\n==Challenges to the ''Paik'' system==\nThe ''Paik'' system was a method by which the Ahom king obtained service from the people and also provided service back to the people.  By the 17th century it had evolved into a robust system that gave the [[Ahom kingdom]] a resilience in the face of a long protracted war against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].  But soon it met challenges.\n\nOver time, the nobles began to appropriate the services of ''kanri paik'', who as a ''likchou'' began to work for these high officials instead of the king.  After the end of [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]], the [[Ahom kingdom]] extended the ''Paik'' system to the regions earlier held by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] but where the royal service  was now payable in cash, following the ''[[pargana]]'' system that was left behind.   The increased production of ''paiks'' and the growth of an internal market over time in the entire kingdom demanded a monetization of the economy, which the ''Paik'' system was unable to handle.  This gave rise to the ''apaikan chamua'' a class of ''paik''s who were released from their ''khels'' and who paid a cash tax in lieu of the service to the king.  The satras too attracted ''paiks'' who wanted to escape the compulsory service.  The satras, in addition, came into competition with the [[Ahom kingdom]] by expanding into new social groups that the [[Ahom kingdom]] would have expanded into otherwise and providing an alternative economic production process.

In this system, adult and able males were obligated to render service to the state and form its militia in return for a piece of land for cultivation owned by the kingdom\u2014believed to be a legacy the Ahoms brought with them from [[South-Eastern Asia]] in 1228.<ref>\"It follows, then, that paddy lands belonged to the community, i.e. to the king as representative of the community.

It resembled very much that of medieval Thailand and also that of Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia.\" {{harvcol|Guha|1966|p=225}}</ref> The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1608, and extensively and exhaustively implemented by 1658 during the reign of [[Sutamla]] Jayadhwaj Singha.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions.  By the end of the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769\u20131805) the Paik system had collapsed.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=51}}</ref>\n\nThe Paik system has had a profound impact on Assam's social life, with many collective practices originating in the medieval times.  Many people in Assam today still carry the Paik offices titles in their last names\u2014''Bora'', ''Saikia'' and ''Hazarika''.  \n\n==''Paik'' system==\nEvery male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of sixteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a ''paik''.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The paiks were organized into four-member groups called ''got''s.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> Each ''got'' had to send one member by rotation for public works. During the absence of a paik the other members of the ''got'' took care of his lands and family. In times of war, the paiks formed the militia. All lands under rice cultivation belonged to the state. Originally, the paiks were organized into ''phoid''s (clans), but by the 17th century the paiks were re-grouped into divisions called ''khel''s.  According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of [[Rudra Singha]], around 1714.  The top [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]] was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class.\n\n===Land holdings===\nThe duty of a ''paik'' was to render service to the Ahom state in exchange for which he was granted 2 ''puras'' (2.66 acres) of [[usufruct]] cultivable land (''gaa mati''), which was neither hereditary nor transferable.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=35}}</ref>  In addition he could maintain his tax-free ancestral homestead and garden (''basti'' and ''bari'' respectively).  The nobility maintained personal estates called ''khats''.\n\nCultivable land called ''roopeet'' was held communally that was distributed among the ''paiks'' (called ''gaa mati'').  Wastelands reclaimed by ''paiks'' or non-''paiks'' not covered by a royal grant are subject to inclusion in the ''roopeet'' category to be distributed as ''gaa mati'' in the next ''paik'' survey. Surplus cultivable land was distributed as ''ubar mati'' among the ''paiks''.\n\n===Royal service===\nThe royal services that the ''paiks'' tended to were defense (the Ahom kingdom did not have a standing army till the beginning of 19th century and its army consisted of the [[militia]] formed of ''paiks''), civil construction (embankments, roads, bridges, tanks, etc.), military production (boats, arrows, muskets), etc. There were two major classes of ''paiks'': ''kanri paik'' (archer) who rendered his service as a soldier or as a laborer and ''chamua paik'' who rendered non-manual service and had a higher social standing.  Some other minor classes were: ''bilatiyas'' (tenants at the estates of nobles), ''dewaliyas'' (attached to temples and [[sattra]]s) and ''bahatiyas'' (attached to hill masters).  ''Kanri paiks'' could move up to ''chamua''.  Most of the lower paik officers&mdash;Bora, Saikia, Hazarika, Tamuli, Pachani&mdash;belonged to the ''chamua'' class.<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=17}}</ref>   \n \nAfter the first major survey recorded in the [[Buranji]]s which was taken in 1510 under [[Suhungmung]], the ''paiks'' were organized according to families and lineage called ''phoids'' and resettled according to their skills. The number of ''paiks'' rendering royal service at any time followed the principle of ''ghar muri e-powa'' or one-fourth the number of ''paiks'' in a household.  The ''paik'' rendering service was rotated and the other ''paiks'' in his household tended to his ''gaa mati'' during his absence.\n\nIn the 1609 restructuring by Momai Tamuli Borbarua the ''phoid'' organization was replaced by the ''got''.  A ''got'' consisted of four ''paiks'' who lived close together.  The ''paiks'' in a ''got'' were numbered ''mul'' (first), ''duwal'' (second), ''tewal'' (third), etc.  In times of peace, generally one of the ''paiks'' in a ''got'' rendered royal service at any given time. In times of war, a second or even a third ''paik'' from a ''got'' could be asked to render service simultaneously. As before, the ''gaa mati'' was tended to by the remaining ''paiks'' of the ''got''. This ensured that economic production did not suffer when a large section of the population was not involved in it and contributed to the resilience of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th to 18th century.\n\nDuring the time of [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1752\u20131789), as the pressure on the ''paik'' system increased, the number of ''paiks'' in each ''got'' was decreased from four to three.\n\n===Organization of the ''paiks''===\nThe ''paiks'' in their ''phoids'' were organized under ''khels'' according to the locality in which they belonged.  Momai Tamuli Borbarua reorganized many such ''khels'' functionally according to the specific service the ''paiks'' in the khel rendered.  Some of the ''khels'' were thus similar to professional or trade guilds.  The organization of the ''khel'' was extended later by his son [[Lachit Borphukan]] into self contained ones by incorporating ''paiks'' of different professions into each ''khel''.\n\n''Khels'' were further organized under a ''mel'' or a ''dagi''.  A group of such divisions was attached to  each of the three great Gohains, which is then called the ''hatimur'' of the particular ''Gohain''.  A second group of divisions was placed under the ''khel'' officers (''Phukan'', ''Rajkhowa'' and ''Barua'') that rendered service to members of the royal family.  The third and the largest group of ''dagis'', organized under ''khel'' officers, rendered service to the king or the state.\n\n===''Paik'' officials===\nThe ''paiks'' in a ''khel'' were organized under a gradation of officials who commanded a set number of them.  They were ''Bora'' (20 ''paiks''), ''Saikia'' (100) and ''Hazarika'' (1000).  More important ''khels'' were commanded by a ''Phukan'' (6000), a ''Rajkhowa'' (a governor of a territory), or a ''Barua'' (a superintending officer) each of whom could command between 2000 and 3000 ''paiks''.\n\nThe ''Phukans'', ''Rajkhowas'', ''Baruas'' and ''Hazarikas'' were nominated by the king and appointed in concurrence with the three great ''Gohains'' ([[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]] and [[Borpatrogohain]]). The ''Boras'' and ''Saikias'' were appointed by their respective ''Phukans'' and ''Rajkhowas''. The ''paiks'' had the right to reject a ''Bora'' or a ''Saikia'' and request another officer of their choice.\n\n''Kanri paiks'' could rise to become ''chamua paiks'' and then to higher ''paik'' officials.  Appointments were made irrespective of the ''paik'''s religion or ethnicity.\n\n===Ahom justice===\nThe Ahom justice system was also based on the ''Paik'' system.  Each ''Paik'' official offered justice to the ''paiks'' and each appeal was heard by the next higher officer in the ''khel'' system.  The system of appeals could go right up to the ''Nyayxodha Phukan''.\n\n==Challenges to the ''Paik'' system==\nThe ''Paik'' system was a method by which the Ahom king obtained service from the people and also provided service back to the people.  By the 17th century it had evolved into a robust system that gave the [[Ahom kingdom]] a resilience in the face of a long protracted war against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].  But soon it met challenges.\n\nOver time, the nobles began to appropriate the services of ''kanri paik'', who as a ''likchou'' began to work for these high officials instead of the king.  After the end of [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]], the [[Ahom kingdom]] extended the ''Paik'' system to the regions earlier held by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] but where the royal service  was now payable in cash, following the ''[[pargana]]'' system that was left behind.   The increased production of ''paiks'' and the growth of an internal market over time in the entire kingdom demanded a monetization of the economy, which the ''Paik'' system was unable to handle.  This gave rise to the ''apaikan chamua'' a class of ''paik''s who were released from their ''khels'' and who paid a cash tax in lieu of the service to the king.  The satras too attracted ''paiks'' who wanted to escape the compulsory service.  The satras, in addition, came into competition with the [[Ahom kingdom]] by expanding into new social groups that the [[Ahom kingdom]] would have expanded into otherwise and providing an alternative economic production process.  This conflict with the satras led to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] which further weakened the [[Ahom kingdom]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation| last=Baruah | given=S.

Although there was great camaraderie and kinship amongst this close community nevertheless a professional eye was kept upon what each other was doing. Most important to the bodger was which company did his competitors supply and at what price.\nBodger Samuel Rockall's account book for 1908 shows he was receiving 19 shillings (\u00a30.95) for a [[gross (unit)|gross]] (144 units) of plain legs including stretchers. With three stretchers to a set of four legs this amounted to 242 turnings in total.<ref name=\"Samuel Rockall\" >[http://www.stuartking.co.uk/index.php/samuel-rockall-last-of-the-chair-bodgers Samuel Rockall, last of the chair bodgers], [http://www.stuartking.co.uk/ Stuart King].</ref><ref name=\"Edwards, Encyc.

There is no known etymology of the modern term bodger that refers to skilled  woodworkers. It first appears {{Circa|1910}},<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eland|first=E|title=The Chilterns and the Vale VI|publisher= Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London|year= 1911|page=136}}</ref> and only applied to a few dozen turners around High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. The Oxford English Dictionary Supplement of 1972 has two definitions for bodger, one is a local dialect word from Buckinghamshire, for  chair leg turner. The other is Australian slang for bad workmanship.<ref name=oed311/> The etymology of the bodger and botcher (poor workmanship) are well recorded from Shakespeare onwards, and now the two terms are synonymous.<ref name=oed311/>\n\nIn [[Samuel Johnson]]'s dictionary of the English language published in 1766, the Shakespearean use of the word \"bodged\", means to \"boggle\".

Another hypothesis (dating from 1879) is that ''bodger'' was a corruption of [[badger]], as similarly to the behaviour of a badger, the bodger dwelt in the [[forest|wood]]s and seldom emerged until evenings.<ref name=hunt624/>\n\nOther hypotheses about its origin include the German word ''B\u00f6ttcher'' ([[cooper (profession)|cooper]], a trade that uses similar tools), and similar Scandinavian words, such the Danish name ''B\u00f8dker''.

Although there was great camaraderie and kinship amongst this close community nevertheless a professional eye was kept upon what each other was doing. Most important to the bodger was which company did his competitors supply and at what price.\nBodger Samuel Rockall's account book for 1908 shows he was receiving 19 shillings (\u00a30.95) for a [[gross (unit)|gross]] (144 units) of plain legs including stretchers. With three stretchers to a set of four legs this amounted to 242 turnings in total.<ref name=\"Samuel Rockall\" >[http://www.stuartking.co.uk/index.php/samuel-rockall-last-of-the-chair-bodgers Samuel Rockall, last of the chair bodgers], [http://www.stuartking.co.uk/ Stuart King].</ref><ref name=\"Edwards, Encyc.

According to Ronald Goodearl, who photographed two of the last professional bodgers, Alec and Owen Dean, in the late 1940s, recalled they had stated \"each man would turn out 144 parts per day (one gross) including legs and stretchers- this would include cutting up the green wood, and turning it into blanks, then turning it\".<ref name=\"Gloag, Chair\" >{{Cite book\n  |first=John  |last=Gloag\n  |title=The chair, its origins, design, and social history\n  |publisher=A.

There is no known etymology of the modern term bodger that refers to skilled  woodworkers. It first appears {{Circa|1910}},<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eland|first=E|title=The Chilterns and the Vale VI|publisher= Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London|year= 1911|page=136}}</ref> and only applied to a few dozen turners around High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. The Oxford English Dictionary Supplement of 1972 has two definitions for bodger, one is a local dialect word from Buckinghamshire, for  chair leg turner. The other is Australian slang for bad workmanship.<ref name=oed311/> The etymology of the bodger and botcher (poor workmanship) are well recorded from Shakespeare onwards, and now the two terms are synonymous.<ref name=oed311/>\n\nIn [[Samuel Johnson]]'s dictionary of the English language published in 1766, the Shakespearean use of the word \"bodged\", means to \"boggle\". According to Johnson \"boggle\" is another word for hesitate.<ref>{{Cite dictionary|last=Johnson|first=Samuel|title=A dictionary of the English language|volume=1|publisher=A. Miller et al|location=London|year=1766|pages=BOA-BOL}}</ref>\n\nOther definitions of the word bodge taken from [[Robert Hunter (encyclop\u00e6dist)|Robert Hunter's]] \"The encyclop\u00e6dic dictionary\", suggest that it could also be a corruption of \"botch\", meaning \"patch\". or a measurement of capacity equivalent to half a [[peck]] - equal to {{convert|1|impgal|liter}}.<ref name=hunt624>{{Cite book|first=Robert  |last=Hunter  |title=The encyclop\u00e6dic dictionary: a new and original work of reference to all the words in the English language, with a full account of their origin, meaning, pronunciation, and use|volume=Volume 1|publisher=Cassell, Petter, Galpin and Co. |year=1879|page=624|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjFAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 March 2014|oclc=75003041}}</ref>\n\nThere is a hypothesis that ''bodges'', defined as rough sacks of corn, closely resembled packages of finished goods the bodgers carried when they left the forest or workshop. Another hypothesis (dating from 1879) is that ''bodger'' was a corruption of [[badger]], as similarly to the behaviour of a badger, the bodger dwelt in the [[forest|wood]]s and seldom emerged until evenings.<ref name=hunt624/>\n\nOther hypotheses about its origin include the German word ''B\u00f6ttcher'' ([[cooper (profession)|cooper]], a trade that uses similar tools), and similar Scandinavian words, such the Danish name ''B\u00f8dker''.

The music was composed by [[Natarajan Sankaran]] with editing by [[Anthony (editor)|Anthony]] and cinematography by [[Dinesh Krishnan]]. The film was released by Shankar's [[S Pictures]] on 25 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/christmas-releases-censored-and-confirmed-news-tamil-omqrIRgfgedbf.html|title=Christmas releases censored and confirmed|work=Sify}}</ref> The movie had a dubbed Telugu release, titled ''Pandavulu Okkadu''.<ref>http://www.123telugu.com/reviews/pandavullo-okadu-telugu-movie-review.html</ref> The movie got mixed to positive response and become a box-office success.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe story starts with Vasu ([[Vaibhav Reddy|Vaibhav]]) narrating his story from childhood. He has four close friends: Kanagasabhapathi ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]), Kalyanasundaram ([[Arjunan]]), Pattabi ([[Venkat Sundar]]), and Venky (Karthik Priyadarshan). The five friends worship Seenu Anna ([[Robo Shankar]]) for his dedication to friendship, and one day, he advises to them that marriage will spoil friendship.\n\nAll the friends take this seriously, except for Vasu, who has a liking for girls, and he is forced to promise not to marry lifelong along with his friends. After failing many attempts of falling in love at school and college (his friends spread rumors that he is gay), he decides to leave to Chennai so that he would get an opportunity to love a girl. He stays with Nelson ([[VTV Ganesh]]), who has affairs with many rich and beautiful girls. Nelson persuades Vasu to trap a rich girl, citing that middle-class and college girls will have bigger competition and high expectations, but rich girls have very less expectations, and many guys do not try to date them, assuming that it is impossible to woo them. He hands the pub membership card to Vasu so that he can get to see many rich girls.\n\nDuring a visit to the pub, arrives Deepika ([[Sonam Bajwa]]) in an Audi car with a male friend, who collapses due to excess drinking. Vasu falls in love with her instantly, helps her lift the friend, accompanies her to the pub, and befriends her. However, when he visits her home the next day, she is unable to recall about him since she was drunk the previous night and rejects his love advances. After all the cop thrashing and goons threatening, Deepika falls in love with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Vasu's friends come to know about his love affair and threaten him to break up with her, but when he acts as if he is committing suicide, they act as if they accept his love but plan to irritate Deepika and break their love. Deepika gets annoyed by their behavior. Soon, the four friends manage to create a rift between both of them, and the duo gets separated. Deepika gets depressed and decides to marry a family friend (Steeve Vatz) who keeps proposing to her from the beginning. Vasu feels depressed after the breakup, and his friends decide that the only way they can see their friend happy is to patch him up with his lady love, and they plot many master plans to stop the wedding. Soon, it is stopped.\n\nDeepika then marries Vasu, and they lead a happy life. Vasu also keeps in touch with his friends forever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vaibhav Reddy|Vaibhav]] as Vasudevan\n* [[Sonam Bajwa]] as Deepika\n* [[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]] as Kanagasabhapathi\n* [[Arjunan]] as Kalyanasundaram\n* [[Venkat Sundar]] as Pattabi\n* Karthik Priyadarshan as Venky\n* [[VTV Ganesh]] as Nelson\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Seenu Anna\n* Rajan Iyer as Deepika's father\n* Steeve Vatz as Deepika's fianc\u00e9e\n* Raviraj as Venky's father\n* Swathi Shanmugam as Gayathri\n* Theni Murugan as Tea Master\n* Preethi Indrani Kitchappan (Ms. Chennai 2012, Ms.Tamil Nadu 2013, Ms. India 2017, Ms. South India 2017 and Ms. Tamil Nadu 2017)\n* Boys Rajan\n* George Vishnu\n* Latsumi\n* Vineetha\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nKarthik Krish,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tamilimdb.com/film/kappal/|title=Kappal|work=tamilimdb.com}}</ref> who had apprenticed under director [[S.

The music was composed by [[Natarajan Sankaran]] with editing by [[Anthony (editor)|Anthony]] and cinematography by [[Dinesh Krishnan]]. The film was released by Shankar's [[S Pictures]] on 25 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/christmas-releases-censored-and-confirmed-news-tamil-omqrIRgfgedbf.html|title=Christmas releases censored and confirmed|work=Sify}}</ref> The movie had a dubbed Telugu release, titled ''Pandavulu Okkadu''.<ref>http://www.123telugu.com/reviews/pandavullo-okadu-telugu-movie-review.html</ref> The movie got mixed to positive response and become a box-office success.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe story starts with Vasu ([[Vaibhav Reddy|Vaibhav]]) narrating his story from childhood. He has four close friends: Kanagasabhapathi ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]), Kalyanasundaram ([[Arjunan]]), Pattabi ([[Venkat Sundar]]), and Venky (Karthik Priyadarshan). The five friends worship Seenu Anna ([[Robo Shankar]]) for his dedication to friendship, and one day, he advises to them that marriage will spoil friendship.\n\nAll the friends take this seriously, except for Vasu, who has a liking for girls, and he is forced to promise not to marry lifelong along with his friends. After failing many attempts of falling in love at school and college (his friends spread rumors that he is gay), he decides to leave to Chennai so that he would get an opportunity to love a girl. He stays with Nelson ([[VTV Ganesh]]), who has affairs with many rich and beautiful girls. Nelson persuades Vasu to trap a rich girl, citing that middle-class and college girls will have bigger competition and high expectations, but rich girls have very less expectations, and many guys do not try to date them, assuming that it is impossible to woo them. He hands the pub membership card to Vasu so that he can get to see many rich girls.\n\nDuring a visit to the pub, arrives Deepika ([[Sonam Bajwa]]) in an Audi car with a male friend, who collapses due to excess drinking. Vasu falls in love with her instantly, helps her lift the friend, accompanies her to the pub, and befriends her. However, when he visits her home the next day, she is unable to recall about him since she was drunk the previous night and rejects his love advances. After all the cop thrashing and goons threatening, Deepika falls in love with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Vasu's friends come to know about his love affair and threaten him to break up with her, but when he acts as if he is committing suicide, they act as if they accept his love but plan to irritate Deepika and break their love. Deepika gets annoyed by their behavior. Soon, the four friends manage to create a rift between both of them, and the duo gets separated. Deepika gets depressed and decides to marry a family friend (Steeve Vatz) who keeps proposing to her from the beginning. Vasu is very depressed after the breakup, and his friends decide that the only way they can see their friend happy is to patch him up with his lady love, and they plot many master plans to stop the wedding. Soon, it is stopped.\n\nDeepika then gets married to Vasu, and they lead a happy life. Vasu also keeps in touch with his friends forever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vaibhav Reddy|Vaibhav]] as Vasudevan\n* [[Sonam Bajwa]] as Deepika\n* [[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]] as Kanagasabhapathi\n* [[Arjunan]] as Kalyanasundaram\n* [[Venkat Sundar]] as Pattabi\n* Karthik Priyadarshan as Venky\n* [[VTV Ganesh]] as Nelson\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Seenu Anna\n* Rajan Iyer as Deepika's father\n* Steeve Vatz as Deepika's fianc\u00e9e\n* Raviraj as Venky's father\n* Swathi Shanmugam as Gayathri\n* Theni Murugan as Tea Master\n* Preethi Indrani Kitchappan (Ms. Chennai 2012, Ms.Tamil Nadu 2013, Ms. India 2017, Ms. South India 2017 and Ms. Tamil Nadu 2017)\n* Boys Rajan\n* George Vishnu\n* Latsumi\n* Vineetha\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nKarthik Krish,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tamilimdb.com/film/kappal/|title=Kappal|work=tamilimdb.com}}</ref> who had apprenticed under director [[S.

It is described on the official website as \"the bloodiest Roman Mystery yet\", and contains detailed descriptions of fighting, slaughter and public executions.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel follows on from events in ''[[The Enemies of Jupiter]]'', at the end of which [[List of characters in The Roman Mysteries#Jonathan ben Mordecai|Jonathan]] goes missing and is believed to have died in the fire in Rome. Unknown to the other characters, he accidentally started the fire and out of guilt signed up as a child gladiator for the games at the new amphitheatre.

For each day a programme of events is given: beginning with acrobats or dancers, then exotic beasts and the fancifully-staged execution of criminals, and in the afternoon the popular gladiatorial contests. The first day, the children are stuck on the top tier with the senator's family watching the displays at a distance, alternately fascinated and horrified at the drama, the ferocity, and the bloodshed.\n\nOn the second day, with the relations safely out of town, they resume their search for Jonathan. Flavia poses as an orphan to get taken on as a \"nymph\" \u2013  only to discover that she is part of a water pageant intended to end in the killing of all the nymphs by [[Hippopotamus|hippos]] and [[crocodile]]s.

Flavia and Nubia visit him after one of his victorious bouts, but to Nubia's surprise, he says he has no interest in being freed - he loves the fighting, the rush of victory, and the fame, luxuries, and adoring female fans heaped on him.\n\nOn the third day, Jonathan's execution is averted by Mnason, Nubia, and Caudex who arrange a spectacular escape which wins the crowd's approval.
