The fourth mainline installment and seventh overall in the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' franchise]], the game was released on November 6, 2012. ''Halo 4''{{'}}s story follows a [[Cybernetics|cybernetically]] enhanced human [[supersoldier]], [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and his [[artificial intelligence]] construct [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], as they encounter unknown threats while exploring an ancient civilization's planet. The player assumes the role of Master Chief who battles against a new faction that splintered off from remnants of the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], a former military alliance of [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|alien]] races, and against mechanical warriors of the [[Factions of Halo#Forerunner|Forerunner]] empire known as the Prometheans. The game features a selection of [[weapons]], enemies, and game modes not present in previous titles of the series.\n\nDevelopment of ''Halo 4'' began in 2009 and continued until September 2012. ''Halo 4'' is 343 Industries' first original title within the ''Halo'' series\u2014previously, development of the main series was undertaken by [[Bungie]], the creator of the franchise. In the developmental process, 343 Industries decided to explore the Forerunner fiction within the ''Halo'' universe, leading the team to design a new setting, enemies, and main antagonist. Existing characters and assets received visual overhauls, recreated from the ground up, and [[motion capture]] was used for animation within cutscenes. A goal for ''Halo 4''{{'}}s story was to incorporate more human elements; to achieve this, the developers chose to delve more deeply into the relationship between the two protagonists, Master Chief and Cortana. Several external studios assisted 343 Industries with developing ''Halo 4'', and over 350 people worked on the game in total.\n\nThe game was officially announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011]] (E3) on June 6. Prior to launch, [[Microsoft]] stated that ''Halo 4'' was the most expensive video game title the company had created so far. The game was marketed with promotional events and videos, including the creation of a live-action film, ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]''. ''Halo 4'' grossed {{US$|220}}&nbsp;million on its launch day and $300&nbsp;million in its opening week\u2014a record for the franchise. More than one million people played ''Halo 4'' on [[Xbox Live]] within the first 24 hours of its release. The game was acclaimed by professional critics and received multiple nominations and awards from the press. It was re-released as part of ''[[Halo: The Master Chief Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox One]] in 2014, and was followed by a sequel, ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', in 2015.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Halo 4 gamplay.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Player character]] [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] attacks an enemy Promethean Knight with an assault rifle in ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign mode]]\n''Halo 4'' is a [[shooter game]] in which players predominantly experience gameplay from a [[First-person shooter|first-person]] perspective; the game perspective switches to third-person when using certain weapons, abilities and vehicles. The player's [[head-up display]] (HUD) shows real-time information on the player character's armor system, such as [[Health (gaming)|shield]] status, information on current weapons and abilities, and waypoints for goals and objectives. The HUD also has a motion tracker that detects allies, enemies, and vehicles within a certain radius of the player.<ref name=\"Waypoint - HUD\" /> The game sees the return of the alien species who were formerly members of the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] as foes, and introduces a new type of enemy called the Prometheans, which are [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunner]] A.I constructs. There are three types of Prometheans: Knights serve as leaders of the group and are considered the deadliest of the Promethean forces; Crawlers are a weaker class that often attack in packs; and Watchers offer support and have the ability to shield or revive Promethean allies.<ref name=\"G4 - Promethean Guide\" /><ref name=\"oxme3\" />\n\n''Halo 4'' features updated versions of many human and Covenant weaponry from previous ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' games, as well as introducing new weapons for the humans, Covenant and Prometheans.<ref name=\"G4 - Promethean Guide\"/><ref name=\"oxme3\"/> The game also features reusable equipment, called armor abilities, introduced in ''[[Halo: Reach]]''. New armor abilities are [[Sentry gun|autosentry]]; the hardlight shield, which activates a protective barrier similar to a [[riot shield]]; Promethean vision, which diminishes environment detail and shows hidden players as [[silhouette]]s; a regeneration field, which heals all players in close proximity and can emit a short range kinetic blast; and finally the thruster pack, which allows the player to launch themselves several feet in a horizontal direction.<ref name=\"oxmuk - armor abilities\" /><ref name=\"oxmuk - armor abilities2\" /> Returning abilities include [[active camouflage]]; [[Jet pack|jetpack]]; and hologram, which creates a doppelg\u00e4nger of the player running towards a target point. Sprinting returns in ''Halo 4''; however, players can now use it independently of their armor ability.<ref name=\"1UP - review\" /> New gameplay mechanics introduced to the series include throwing and catching, which has been implemented into the multiplayer game modes Oddball and [[Rooster Teeth Productions#Grifball|Grifball]].<ref name=\"eurog - grifball\" />\n\n===Modes===\n''Halo 4''{{'}}s story or campaign mode can be played alone or [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] with one other player on the same console via [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]], and up to three other players through [[Xbox Live]].<ref name=\"bulletin11112\" /><ref name=\"eurogamerexpo\" /> Unlike in ''[[Halo 3]]'' cooperative campaign where each player takes the role of a different character, in ''Halo 4'' all players assume the role of [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]].<ref name=\"eurogamerexpo\"/> Players can enable \"skulls\" in the campaign menu which act as gameplay modifiers such as increasing enemy health, changing [[Non-player character|NPC]] behavior or removing elements of the player's HUD.<ref name=\"bulletin101712\" /> The campaign also features terminals which provide the player with additional [[backstory]] via videos viewed in the ''Halo Waypoint'' application on the Xbox 360.<ref name=\"gdc - transmedia\" />\n\nIn ''Halo 4''{{'}}s multiplayer component, titled \"Infinity\", players assume the role of a customizable [[Characters of Halo#Spartans|Spartan-IV super-soldier]]. Players can progress through [[Levels up|ranks]] by earning [[experience point]]s from completing matches and challenges. Gameplay items such as visual customizations, weapons, armor abilities, and various upgrades are unlocked and can be acquired by players when they gain ranks. Once players attain rank SR-50, they can enlist into a \"Specialization\", enabling them to unlock further cosmetic and gameplay-enhancing customizations for their Spartan.<ref name=\"bulletin101012\" /> War Games is a competitive multiplayer matchmaking mode.<ref name=\"bulletin101012\"/> There are various playlists with different game types ranging from standard [[deathmatch]] to objective oriented modes such as [[Capture the flag (video games)|capture the flag]].<ref name=\"waypoint - wargames\" /> War Games can be played with up to sixteen players on Xbox Live and has up to four-player split screen support.<ref name=\"bulletin11112\"/> In ''Halo 4'', players are able to join certain multiplayer matchmaking sessions while they are in progress.<ref name=\"1UP - review\"/> Spartan Ops is a story-driven episodic game mode, that can be played solo or cooperatively like the campaign mode.<ref name=\"bulletin11112\"/><ref name=\"ign-spartanops\" /> It serves as a replacement for the Firefight game mode that featured in ''Halo: Reach'' and ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]''.<ref name=\"ign-spartanops\"/> Ten episodes of content were released for Spartan Ops, each featured a cinematic and five objective-based missions.<ref name=\"eurog - SO review\" /> The first five episodes were delivered on a weekly basis following ''Halo 4''{{'}}s launch, the final five episodes were released in early 2013.<ref name=\"bulletin11613\" />\n\nOther game features include Forge, a map-editing tool first introduced in ''Halo 3''. Like War Games it has both split screen and Xbox Live support. Using the tool, players can edit default multiplayer maps by adding or modifying spawn points, weapons and items, or create new ones using canvases. Forge in ''Halo 4'' contains a new \"magnet\" feature for connecting forge pieces together.<ref name=\"polygon-forge\" /> Theater mode allows players to view films, create video clips, and capture screen shots from recent matches in War Games or custom games.<ref name=\"IGN - review\" /> ''Halo 4'' also offers a file sharing system that allows players to upload and share video clips, screenshots, custom maps and game variants.<ref name=\"bulletin121212\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Halo 4'' takes place in a futuristic [[science fiction]] setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of ''Halo 3''.<ref name=\"Waypoint - Campaign\" /> Backstory details that hundreds of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the [[Halo Array]]. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.<ref name=\"encyclopedia - the forerunners\" /><ref name=\"encyclopedia - battling the flood\" /><!-- greg bear citations Cryptum -->\n\nIn the 26th century, humanity came under attack by the Covenant, an alien collective of species that worship the Forerunners as gods.<ref name=\"waypoint - covenant\" /> The human supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 and his artificial intelligence companion [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], were instrumental in stopping the Halos from being activated, and the Flood from once again menacing the galaxy. At the end of ''Halo 3'' Chief and Cortana were left stranded in unknown space aboard the remains of the vessel ''Forward Unto Dawn''.<ref name=\"waypoint - halothusfar\" />\n\n===Campaign===\n''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifts towards the Forerunner installation Requiem. Cortana wakes Master Chief from [[cryonics|cryonic sleep]] shortly before forces from a new Covenant faction board the vessel. The remnants of ''Forward Unto Dawn'' are caught in Requiem's [[gravity well]] and pass through an opening to crash-land on its interior. As Chief and Cortana explore Requiem, fighting hostile Covenant forces and mechanical warriors called \"Promethean Knights\", Cortana malfunctions. She reveals that she is experiencing \"rampancy\", a declining mental state faced by AIs past their seven-year life span. Chief promises to get Cortana to Earth, believing that Cortana's creator, Doctor [[Catherine Halsey]], can fix Cortana's condition. Chief and Cortana pick up garbled transmissions from a human ship, UNSC ''Infinity'', who have picked up ''Dawn''{{'}}s distress call. Cortana attempts to warn ''Infinity'' away from Requiem's gravity well and directs the Chief to deactivate what she believes are communications jammers. Instead, the Chief unwittingly releases the Didact, an ancient Forerunner warrior, from imprisonment. The Didact takes control of the Prometheans and Covenant forces, and attacks ''Infinity'' after it is dragged into Requiem.\n\nChief makes contact with ''Infinity'' and helps repel the Didact's attack. Chief and Cortana recommend attacking the Didact while he is vulnerable, but ''Infinity'' captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so their ship can escape. In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian\u2014the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's protector. She explains that the Forerunners were divided on how best to combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into Promethean Knights immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian. The Librarian, who has guided humanity's development, accelerates the Chief's evolution to grant him immunity to the Composer.\n\nAfter destroying the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind to oppose the Didact. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but are unsuccessful. They follow the Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant faction attacks. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station, composing every individual save Chief.\n\nChief and Cortana use a fighter to follow the Didact's ship to Earth. Aided by ''Infinity'' and the home fleet, the Chief boards the Didact's ship with a nuclear warhead. Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact's shield, but not before the Didact directs the Composer at Earth. With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a portal underneath the Composer. The Master Chief activates the bomb but is saved by Cortana, who sacrifices herself. The Chief is found by a rescue team and is taken back to ''Infinity'', where he mourns the loss of Cortana. In a post-credits cutscene, the Didact proclaims the Forerunner's role as custodians of the galaxy having to bear the Mantle of Responsibility, and humanity as the greatest threat in the galaxy. Master Chief removes his armor aboard ''Infinity''; if the player completes the game on Legendary difficulty, the Chief's eyes are briefly shown.<ref name=\"cvg - secrets\" />\n\n===Spartan Ops===\nSpartan Ops take place six months after ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign. ''Infinity'' returns to Requiem, where the Prometheans and Covenant insurgents\u2014led by Jul 'Mdama, who styles himself as \"the Didact's Hand\"\u2014are still active. Sarah Palmer, commander of the Spartan-IVs, deploys Spartan squads to clear out Covenant and Promethean forces in Requiem's interior in order to set up research bases. Fireteam Crimson recovers a mysterious artifact excavated by Covenant; ''Infinity'' scientist Doctor Glassman disappears after studying the device. Catherine Halsey is brought to ''Infinity'' due to her knowledge of Forerunner technology. She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on Earth. While studying the artifact, Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him to work on a Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with 'Mdama, but Halsey uses an override code to force ''Infinity''{{'}}s AI, Roland, to assist her. Halsey contacts 'Mdama to try and strike a deal, as they both want to find the Librarian; Roland breaks free of Halsey's control and summons guards to apprehend Halsey. Promethean forces invade ''Infinity'', capture Halsey, and teleport her to 'Mdama's base. Serin Osman, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), orders ''Infinity'' captain Thomas Lasky to kill Halsey, but he is reluctant to do so. Palmer sets off to Requiem to kill Halsey; Lasky tells Fireteam Majestic to intervene and rescue Halsey from 'Mdama.\n\nHalsey steps into the Forerunner device and makes contact with the Librarian. The Librarian gives Halsey the two pieces of the \"Janus Key\", an instrument that provides the location for all Forerunner technology in the galaxy, and instructs Halsey to use the key to advance humankind. Upon receiving the key, Halsey exits the device and 'Mdama takes half of the key from her. Halsey passes the second piece to Fireteam Majestic.

Microsoft retained the intellectual property and rights to ''Halo'', and Bungie continued developing ''Halo'' games until 2010. During this period of time Microsoft formed an internal division, 343 Industries, to manage the franchise and develop future games.<ref name=\"polygon - playtest\" /><ref name=\"cnn_bungie\" />\n\nIn 2008, while 343 Industries was still in formation, Microsoft approached Starlight Runner Entertainment to help assemble the \"''Halo'' bible\". Starlight Runner is a [[New York City|New York]]-based company that specializes in creating and producing [[Transmedia storytelling|transmedia]] franchises. Their job was to examine all content of the ''Halo'' universe, clean it up, and make it coherent and understandable for the people involved with the creation of ''Halo'' games and media. Frank O'Connor, a content manager at Bungie, assisted the team with the creation of the \"''Halo'' bible\" before moving to 343 Industries to become ''Halo'' franchise development director.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\" /><ref name=\"OXM - starlight\" /><ref name=\"OXM - starlight2\" /> Unlike the original trilogy, the story for ''Halo 4'' was designed to be part of a multi-game arc from the beginning.<ref name=\"h4panel\" /> In addition, 343 Industries aimed for \"a more complete connectivity between all of their future media than before\"; relating ''Halo 4''{{'}}s story to the ''Forerunner Saga'' and ''Kilo-Five Trilogy'' novels as well as using terminals in ''Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary'' to introduce background knowledge on the Forerunners.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\"/><ref name=\"h4panel\"/>\n<!-- expand here on transmedia: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/180771/Video_Managing_Halos_transmedia_empire.php#.US0XrDDIZ8M -->\n\n343 started with a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through development.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\" /> ''Halo 4''{{'}}s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told they were going to be working on ''Halo 4''. \"We had people who we hired who hated ''Halo'' because of 'X,'\" said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. \"But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_3\" /> This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, ''Halo 4'' executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make \"necessary mistakes\", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\" /> Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an \"epiphany moment\" that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was \"very traditional [''Halo'']\". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_3\" />\n\nIncluding contractors, 350 people worked on the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\"/> 343 Industries contracted [[Certain Affinity]], an independent video game development studio, to help with the development of ''Halo 4''; they started work on the game in early 2011.<ref name=\"EuroG - certainaffinity\"/> Certain Affinity has worked alongside Bungie and 343 Industries on producing multiplayer content for previous ''Halo'' titles.<ref name=\"polygon-forge\"/> The studio developed the Forge mode, co-developed War Games and created a number of maps and multiplayer modes for ''Halo 4''.<ref name=\"EuroG - certainaffinity\"/>\n\n''Halo 4'' and ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary]]'' were both officially announced on June 6, 2011, at the [[E3 2011]].<ref name=\"IGNe32011\" /> ''Halo 4'' is the first installment in the Reclaimer Saga of ''Halo'' games.<ref name=\"Gspot - saga\" /> The studio's creative team, which included nearly 200 people led by creative director [[Josh Holmes (video game designer)|Josh Holmes]], started developing the game as early as 2009.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\" /><ref name=\"h4panel\" /> Prior to the release of the game, Microsoft Studios Vice President [[Phil Spencer (Microsoft)|Phil Spencer]] stated that the ''Halo'' franchise is the \"most important entertainment product in the company\" and that ''Halo 4'' was the most expensive game that Microsoft had made.<ref name=\"polygon - playtest\"/> A demonstration of the game's campaign was first shown at [[E3 2012]]. The developers described it as a pivotal moment in development, as it was the first time the game had been shown publicly. The positive reaction was a morale boost for the team, who were unsure how the public would react.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_3\"/> On July 7, 2012, a pre-release build of ''Halo 4''{{'}}s Forge mode was showcased by 343 Industries and Certain Affinity at [[Rooster Teeth Productions#RTX|RTX]] which took place at the [[Austin Convention Center]].<ref name=\"polygon-forge\"/><ref name=\"EuroG - certainaffinity\"/><ref name=\"bulletin71812\" /> On September 26, 2012, O'Connor announced that the game's development was complete.<ref name=\"Halo4complete\" />\n\n===Design===\n<!-- master chiefs return, covenant's return: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/will-halo-4s-next-gen-successors-kick-some-ass-absolutely-says-343s-scott-warner-8021773.html http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/181319/Halo_4s_look_came_from_artistic_obsession.php#.UQPu9L9LMmK-->\nFollowing ''Halo 4''{{'}}s announcement, O'Connor reported that both Master Chief and Cortana would undergo \"radical\" changes in appearance for the game, some of them attributed to better graphics and others to story elements.<ref name=\"cvg - trilogy\" /> The studio wanted Master Chief's appearance to convey an imposing mass and weight, to show that one of his characteristics is his {{convert|800|lb|kg|adj=on}} armor.<ref name=\"gamasutra - art\" /><ref name=\"bulletin21512\" /> They studied the armor changes that were made for the Spartans in ''Halo: Reach'', which were much bulkier than renditions in previous ''Halo'' games.<ref name=\"bulletin21512\"/> Character and concept artists began redesigning the Master Chief by creating sketches; these sketches would be rendered into [[3D modeling|3D models]] so the team could analyze the design from every possible angle. The team would then return to creating sketches to make adjustments, and repeat the process until the main structure for the Master Chief was created. The team then worked on the finer details of his appearance.<ref name=\"gamasutra - art\"/><ref name=\"heroawakens\" /><ref name=\"verge - concept art\" />\n\nDuring the concepting process of ''Halo 4'', O'Connor decided it would be best for the franchise to explore the Forerunner fiction of the ''Halo'' universe, which had remained largely a mystery before 343 Industries' involvement in the franchise.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\"/> This ultimately led to the creation of a new race of enemy, the Prometheans, warriors of the Forerunner empire.<ref name=\"bulletin91212\" /> Given that the Forerunners themselves had never been featured in previous ''Halo'' games, the design process for the appearance of the Prometheans was long and tedious. The art team produced a large number of sketches, which were presented to other members of the studio to get feedback and reactions. Many variations of different character models were considered before the team decided on a final design.<ref name=\"gamasutra - art\"/><ref name=\"verge - concept art\"/><ref name=\"bulletin91212\"/> The main goal when designing their appearance was to make them resonate with the player, and evoke the image of the Forerunner architecture and language that had been portrayed in previous ''Halo'' media. Upon death, the Promethean Knight dissolves from the point where it was last shot; this visual effect also occurs when certain enemies are killed by Promethean weapons. From a gameplay standpoint the design for the Prometheans also needed to fit in well with the sandbox so they would be suitable enemies to fight. A goal when designing their behavior was to make them highly adaptive from a tactical standpoint. For example, the Promethean Knight can phase in and out of space, allowing it to retreat or charge the player at any given moment; this changes the way that a player engages in a combat encounter.<ref name=\"bulletin91212\"/>\n\nHolmes explained that one of the goals for ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign was to incorporate more human elements into the story. To accomplish this the team wrote a [[Subplot|B story]] that explored Master Chief's relationship with his AI partner, Cortana, who would break down into a [[dementia]]-like state.<ref name=\"Gspot - story\" /> The development team realized that ''Halo 4''{{'}}s narrative could be dense and hard to approach, making it inaccessible for new players.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\"/> They found incorporating such a storyline into an action game to be extremely challenging and considered dropping it during development. Holmes was adamant about including it; he took inspiration from his mother's battle with dementia, which she was diagnosed with near the start of the game's development. This led Holmes to want to capture the emotion and tell \"a perfect story\".<ref name=\"Gspot - story\"/>\n\n[[File:Halo4 concept.png|thumb|left|A piece of concept art showing the gravity-defying architecture and scenery of the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] planet, Requiem]]\nThe senior art director for ''Halo 4'' is Kenneth Scott; he described the visual style of ''Halo 4'' as being more ingrained in the expanded universe fiction, and more \"mature\" than before.<ref name=\"h4panel\"/><ref name=\"polycount - art1\" /> With the game's increased focus on the Forerunners, the artists invested heavily into the look and feel of Forerunner technology. The game also features more diversity in Forerunner structures, including fully active Forerunner technology as opposed to the mostly inert and abandoned structures seen in the earlier games.<ref name=\"h4panel\"/><ref name=\"polycount - art2\" /><ref name=\"polycount - art3\" /> The majority of the game is lit statically using [[lightmap]]s; this allowed the art team to achieve realistic lighting effects with full [[global illumination]] and [[ambient occlusion]]. [[Image-based lighting]] is also used to ground scenes and make everything fit together better.<ref name=\"polycount - art1\"/>\n\n<!--http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/18/3889526/halo-4-spartan-ops-episodes-6-10, http://www.gamedesignexpo.com/2013/02/the-making-of-halo-4s-episodic-co-op-adventure-spartan-ops-2/ -->\nThe cooperative Spartan Ops mode originally began as a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in ''Halo: Reach'', but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a narrative that would tie ''Halo 4''{{'}}s multiplayer together. The missions were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode such that the cinematics would tie in with the missions.<ref name=\"bulletin112112\" />\n\n<!--good source to use here: http://www.3dworldmag.com/2013/03/26/cool-cg-halo-4-spartan-ops/, http://www.fxguide.com/featured/the-making-of-halo-4-spartan-ops/ -->\n[[Glasgow]] based animation studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on the creation of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for ''[[Dead Island]]''. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in [[live action]] using [[performance capture]]. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the [[Computer animation|3D animation]] package, [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], to [[Procedural generation|procedurally generate]] the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based [[audio post production]] company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics.<ref name=\"awn - axis1\" /> [[Facial motion capture]] was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios.<ref name=\"heroawakens\"/><ref name=\"awn - axis1\"/> Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.<ref name=\"awn - axis1\"/>\n\nVisual effects house The Sequence Group, who had previously developed animation for ''Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary''{{'}}s terminals,<ref name=\"sequence\" /> returned to create additional animation for ''Halo 4''. The Terminals feature a painterly artistic style, which Sequence president Ian Kirby felt appealed to gamers familiar with the style of [[concept art]]. In addition to creating the visuals for the ''Halo 4'' terminals, their work appeared in one of the game's main cinematics. To save time and expense using traditional motion capture methods to animate the 3D characters, The Sequence Group used twin Microsoft [[Kinect]] infrared sensors to create a home-made solution.<ref name=\"fxguide_mocap\" />\n\nThe game utilizes much of the \"sandbox\" that has been featured across all six prior ''Halo'' games and other media, in addition to introducing new characters, weapons, vehicles, and other elements.<ref name=\"h4panel\"/> The game engine used is a heavily modified version of the engine established by Bungie.

He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign, in the same way that they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for ''Halo 2'' on the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in ''Halo 3''{{'}}s campaign.

He also thought that the multiplayer component was more approachable to people outside of the core player-base without dumbing anything down.<ref name=\"polygon - review\" />\n\n<!-- spartan ops -->\nReception towards Spartan Ops was less favorable than multiplayer and campaign; some reviewers expressed their disappointment in Spartan Ops replacing the cooperative Firefight mode.<ref name=\"1UP - review\"/><ref name=\"GI_review\" /> Criticisms were aimed at the brevity of missions and lack of replay value.<ref name=\"IGN - review\"/><ref name=\"GSpot_review\" /> Despite any shortcomings, IGN said the mode was a must-play for the \"incredible pre-episode cinematics\" which open up \"a number of interesting narrative possibilities for future episodes and seasons.\"<ref name=\"IGN - review\"/> Martin Robinson of Eurogamer complained about the repetition of environments within the first half of the season and noted that missions quickly become a chore. He felt that Spartan Ops was a \"weak, bloated alternative\" compared to Firefight.<ref name=\"eurog_spartan_ops\" /> ''1UP.com'' found that while the short length felt odd initially, the mode was still fun to play and offered more opportunities to play ''Halo'' cooperatively.<ref name=\"1UP - review\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n<!-- add prose/summary: http://www.torontosun.com/2012/12/19/seth-macfarlane-qmi-agencys-entertainer-of-12 http://www.gamemarketingsummit.com/awards/winners/-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ List of pre-release awards and nominations\n|-\n!

console]]. The fourth mainline installment and seventh overall in the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' franchise]], the game was released on November 6, 2012. ''Halo 4''{{'}}s story follows a [[Cybernetics|cybernetically]] enhanced human [[supersoldier]], [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and his [[artificial intelligence]] construct [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], as they encounter unknown threats while exploring an ancient civilization's planet. The player assumes the role of Master Chief who battles against a new faction that splintered off from remnants of the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], a former military alliance of [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|alien]] races, and against mechanical warriors of the [[Factions of Halo#Forerunner|Forerunner]] empire known as the Prometheans. The game features a selection of [[weapons]], enemies, and game modes not present in previous titles of the series.\n\nDevelopment of ''Halo 4'' began in 2009 and continued until September 2012. ''Halo 4'' is 343 Industries' first original title within the ''Halo'' series\u2014previously, development of the main series was undertaken by [[Bungie]], the creator of the franchise. In the developmental process, 343 Industries decided to explore the Forerunner fiction within the ''Halo'' universe, leading the team to design a new setting, enemies, and main antagonist. Existing characters and assets received visual overhauls, recreated from the ground up, and [[motion capture]] was used for animation within cutscenes. A goal for ''Halo 4''{{'}}s story was to incorporate more human elements; to achieve this, the developers chose to delve more deeply into the relationship between the two protagonists, Master Chief and Cortana. Several external studios assisted 343 Industries with developing ''Halo 4'', and over 350 people worked on the game in total.\n\nThe game was officially announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011]] (E3) on June 6. Prior to launch, [[Microsoft]] stated that ''Halo 4'' was the most expensive video game title the company had created so far. The game was marketed with promotional events and videos, including the creation of a live-action film, ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]''. ''Halo 4'' grossed {{US$|220}}&nbsp;million on its launch day and $300&nbsp;million in its opening week\u2014a record for the franchise. More than one million people played ''Halo 4'' on [[Xbox Live]] within the first 24 hours of its release. The game was acclaimed by professional critics and received multiple nominations and awards from the press. It was re-released as part of ''[[Halo: The Master Chief Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox One]] in 2014, and was followed by a sequel, ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', in 2015.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Halo 4 gamplay.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Player character]] [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] attacks an enemy Promethean Knight with an assault rifle in ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign mode]]\n''Halo 4'' is a [[shooter game]] in which players predominantly experience gameplay from a [[First-person shooter|first-person]] perspective; the game perspective switches to third-person when using certain weapons, abilities and vehicles. The player's [[head-up display]] (HUD) shows real-time information on the player character's armor system, such as [[Health (gaming)|shield]] status, information on current weapons and abilities, and waypoints for goals and objectives. The HUD also has a motion tracker that detects allies, enemies, and vehicles within a certain radius of the player.<ref name=\"Waypoint - HUD\" /> The game sees the return of the alien species who were formerly members of the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] as foes, and introduces a new type of enemy called the Prometheans, which are [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunner]] A.I constructs. There are three types of Prometheans: Knights serve as leaders of the group and are considered the deadliest of the Promethean forces; Crawlers are a weaker class that often attack in packs; and Watchers offer support and have the ability to shield or revive Promethean allies.<ref name=\"G4 - Promethean Guide\" /><ref name=\"oxme3\" />\n\n''Halo 4'' features updated versions of many human and Covenant weaponry from previous ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' games, as well as introducing new weapons for the humans, Covenant and Prometheans.<ref name=\"G4 - Promethean Guide\"/><ref name=\"oxme3\"/> The game also features reusable equipment, called armor abilities, introduced in ''[[Halo: Reach]]''. New armor abilities are [[Sentry gun|autosentry]]; the hardlight shield, which activates a protective barrier similar to a [[riot shield]]; Promethean vision, which diminishes environment detail and shows hidden players as [[silhouette]]s; a regeneration field, which heals all players in close proximity and can emit a short range kinetic blast; and finally the thruster pack, which allows the player to launch themselves several feet in a horizontal direction.<ref name=\"oxmuk - armor abilities\" /><ref name=\"oxmuk - armor abilities2\" /> Returning abilities include [[active camouflage]]; [[Jet pack|jetpack]]; and hologram, which creates a doppelg\u00e4nger of the player running towards a target point. Sprinting returns in ''Halo 4''; however, players can now use it independently of their armor ability.<ref name=\"1UP - review\" /> New gameplay mechanics introduced to the series include throwing and catching, which has been implemented into the multiplayer game modes Oddball and [[Rooster Teeth Productions#Grifball|Grifball]].<ref name=\"eurog - grifball\" />\n\n===Modes===\n''Halo 4''{{'}}s story or campaign mode can be played alone or [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] with one other player on the same console via [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]], and up to three other players through [[Xbox Live]].<ref name=\"bulletin11112\" /><ref name=\"eurogamerexpo\" /> Unlike in ''[[Halo 3]]'' cooperative campaign where each player takes the role of a different character, in ''Halo 4'' all players assume the role of [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]].<ref name=\"eurogamerexpo\"/> Players can enable \"skulls\" in the campaign menu which act as gameplay modifiers such as increasing enemy health, changing [[Non-player character|NPC]] behavior or removing elements of the player's HUD.<ref name=\"bulletin101712\" /> The campaign also features terminals which provide the player with additional [[backstory]] via videos viewed in the ''Halo Waypoint'' application on the Xbox 360.<ref name=\"gdc - transmedia\" />\n\nIn ''Halo 4''{{'}}s multiplayer component, titled \"Infinity\", players assume the role of a customizable [[Characters of Halo#Spartans|Spartan-IV super-soldier]]. Players can progress through [[Levels up|ranks]] by earning [[experience point]]s from completing matches and challenges. Gameplay items such as visual customizations, weapons, armor abilities, and various upgrades are unlocked and can be acquired by players when they gain ranks. Once players attain rank SR-50, they can enlist into a \"Specialization\", enabling them to unlock further cosmetic and gameplay-enhancing customizations for their Spartan.<ref name=\"bulletin101012\" /> War Games is a competitive multiplayer matchmaking mode.<ref name=\"bulletin101012\"/> There are various playlists with different game types ranging from standard [[deathmatch]] to objective oriented modes such as [[Capture the flag (video games)|capture the flag]].<ref name=\"waypoint - wargames\" /> War Games can be played with up to sixteen players on Xbox Live and has up to four-player split screen support.<ref name=\"bulletin11112\"/> In ''Halo 4'', players are able to join certain multiplayer matchmaking sessions while they are in progress.<ref name=\"1UP - review\"/> Spartan Ops is a story-driven episodic game mode, that can be played solo or cooperatively like the campaign mode.<ref name=\"bulletin11112\"/><ref name=\"ign-spartanops\" /> It serves as a replacement for the Firefight game mode that featured in ''Halo: Reach'' and ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]''.<ref name=\"ign-spartanops\"/> Ten episodes of content were released for Spartan Ops, each featured a cinematic and five objective-based missions.<ref name=\"eurog - SO review\" /> The first five episodes were delivered on a weekly basis following ''Halo 4''{{'}}s launch, the final five episodes were released in early 2013.<ref name=\"bulletin11613\" />\n\nOther game features include Forge, a map-editing tool first introduced in ''Halo 3''. Like War Games it has both split screen and Xbox Live support. Using the tool, players can edit default multiplayer maps by adding or modifying spawn points, weapons and items, or create new ones using canvases. Forge in ''Halo 4'' contains a new \"magnet\" feature for connecting forge pieces together.<ref name=\"polygon-forge\" /> Theater mode allows players to view films, create video clips, and capture screen shots from recent matches in War Games or custom games.<ref name=\"IGN - review\" /> ''Halo 4'' also offers a file sharing system that allows players to upload and share video clips, screenshots, custom maps and game variants.<ref name=\"bulletin121212\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Halo 4'' takes place in a futuristic [[science fiction]] setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of ''Halo 3''.<ref name=\"Waypoint - Campaign\" /> Backstory details that hundreds of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the [[Halo Array]]. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.<ref name=\"encyclopedia - the forerunners\" /><ref name=\"encyclopedia - battling the flood\" /><!-- greg bear citations Cryptum -->\n\nIn the 26th century, humanity came under attack by the Covenant, an alien collective of species that worship the Forerunners as gods.<ref name=\"waypoint - covenant\" /> The human supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 and his artificial intelligence companion [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], were instrumental in stopping the Halos from being activated, and the Flood from once again menacing the galaxy. At the end of ''Halo 3'' Chief and Cortana were left stranded in unknown space aboard the remains of the vessel ''Forward Unto Dawn''.<ref name=\"waypoint - halothusfar\" />\n\n===Campaign===\n''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifts towards the Forerunner installation Requiem. Cortana wakes Master Chief from [[cryonics|cryonic sleep]] shortly before forces from a new Covenant faction board the vessel. The remnants of ''Forward Unto Dawn'' are caught in Requiem's [[gravity well]] and pass through an opening to crash-land on its interior. As Chief and Cortana explore Requiem, fighting hostile Covenant forces and mechanical warriors called \"Promethean Knights\", Cortana malfunctions. She reveals that she is experiencing \"rampancy\", a declining mental state faced by AIs past their seven-year life span. Chief promises to get Cortana to Earth, believing that Cortana's creator, Doctor [[Catherine Halsey]], can fix Cortana's condition. Chief and Cortana pick up garbled transmissions from a human ship, UNSC ''Infinity'', who have picked up ''Dawn''{{'}}s distress call. Cortana attempts to warn ''Infinity'' away from Requiem's gravity well and directs the Chief to deactivate what she believes are communications jammers. Instead, the Chief unwittingly releases the Didact, an ancient Forerunner warrior, from imprisonment. The Didact takes control of the Prometheans and Covenant forces, and attacks ''Infinity'' after it is dragged into Requiem.\n\nChief makes contact with ''Infinity'' and helps repel the Didact's attack. Chief and Cortana recommend attacking the Didact while he is vulnerable, but ''Infinity'' captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so their ship can escape. In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian\u2014the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's protector. She explains that the Forerunners were divided on how best to combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into Promethean Knights immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian. The Librarian, who has guided humanity's development, accelerates the Chief's evolution to grant him immunity to the Composer.\n\nAfter destroying the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind to oppose the Didact. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but are unsuccessful. They follow the Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant faction attacks. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station, composing every individual save Chief.\n\nChief and Cortana use a fighter to follow the Didact's ship to Earth. Aided by ''Infinity'' and the home fleet, the Chief boards the Didact's ship with a nuclear warhead. Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact's shield, but not before the Didact directs the Composer at Earth. With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a portal underneath the Composer. The Master Chief activates the bomb but is saved by Cortana, who sacrifices herself. The Chief is found by a rescue team and is taken back to ''Infinity'', where he mourns the loss of Cortana. In a post-credits cutscene, the Didact proclaims the Forerunner's role as custodians of the galaxy having to bear the Mantle of Responsibility, and humanity as the greatest threat in the galaxy. Master Chief removes his armor aboard ''Infinity''; if the player completes the game on Legendary difficulty, the Chief's eyes are briefly shown.<ref name=\"cvg - secrets\" />\n\n===Spartan Ops===\nSpartan Ops take place six months after ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign. ''Infinity'' returns to Requiem, where the Prometheans and Covenant insurgents\u2014led by Jul 'Mdama, who styles himself as \"the Didact's Hand\"\u2014are still active. Sarah Palmer, commander of the Spartan-IVs, deploys Spartan squads to clear out Covenant and Promethean forces in Requiem's interior in order to set up research bases. Fireteam Crimson recovers a mysterious artifact excavated by Covenant; ''Infinity'' scientist Doctor Glassman disappears after studying the device. Catherine Halsey is brought to ''Infinity'' due to her knowledge of Forerunner technology. She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on Earth. While studying the artifact, Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him to work on a Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with 'Mdama, but Halsey uses an override code to force ''Infinity''{{'}}s AI, Roland, to assist her. Halsey contacts 'Mdama to try and strike a deal, as they both want to find the Librarian; Roland breaks free of Halsey's control and summons guards to apprehend Halsey. Promethean forces invade ''Infinity'', capture Halsey, and teleport her to 'Mdama's base. Serin Osman, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), orders ''Infinity'' captain Thomas Lasky to kill Halsey, but he is reluctant to do so. Palmer sets off to Requiem to kill Halsey; Lasky tells Fireteam Majestic to intervene and rescue Halsey from 'Mdama.\n\nHalsey steps into the Forerunner device and makes contact with the Librarian. The Librarian gives Halsey the two pieces of the \"Janus Key\", an instrument that provides the location for all Forerunner technology in the galaxy, and instructs Halsey to use the key to advance humankind. Upon receiving the key, Halsey exits the device and 'Mdama takes half of the key from her. Halsey passes the second piece to Fireteam Majestic.

Microsoft retained the intellectual property and rights to ''Halo'', and Bungie continued developing ''Halo'' games until 2010. During this period of time Microsoft formed an internal division, 343 Industries, to manage the franchise and develop future games.<ref name=\"polygon - playtest\" /><ref name=\"cnn_bungie\" />\n\nIn 2008, while 343 Industries was still in formation, Microsoft approached Starlight Runner Entertainment to help assemble the \"''Halo'' bible\". Starlight Runner is a [[New York City|New York]]-based company that specializes in creating and producing [[Transmedia storytelling|transmedia]] franchises. Their job was to examine all content of the ''Halo'' universe, clean it up, and make it coherent and understandable for the people involved with the creation of ''Halo'' games and media. Frank O'Connor, a content manager at Bungie, assisted the team with the creation of the \"''Halo'' bible\" before moving to 343 Industries to become ''Halo'' franchise development director.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\" /><ref name=\"OXM - starlight\" /><ref name=\"OXM - starlight2\" /> Unlike the original trilogy, the story for ''Halo 4'' was designed to be part of a multi-game arc from the beginning.<ref name=\"h4panel\" /> In addition, 343 Industries aimed for \"a more complete connectivity between all of their future media than before\"; relating ''Halo 4''{{'}}s story to the ''Forerunner Saga'' and ''Kilo-Five Trilogy'' novels as well as using terminals in ''Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary'' to introduce background knowledge on the Forerunners.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\"/><ref name=\"h4panel\"/>\n<!-- expand here on transmedia: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/180771/Video_Managing_Halos_transmedia_empire.php#.US0XrDDIZ8M -->\n\n343 started with a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through development.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\" /> ''Halo 4''{{'}}s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told they were going to be working on ''Halo 4''. \"We had people who we hired who hated ''Halo'' because of 'X,'\" said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. \"But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_3\" /> This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, ''Halo 4'' executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make \"necessary mistakes\", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\" /> Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an \"epiphany moment\" that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was \"very traditional [''Halo'']\". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_3\" />\n\nIncluding contractors, 350 people worked on the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\"/> 343 Industries contracted [[Certain Affinity]], an independent video game development studio, to help with the development of ''Halo 4''; they started work on the game in early 2011.<ref name=\"EuroG - certainaffinity\"/> Certain Affinity has worked alongside Bungie and 343 Industries on producing multiplayer content for previous ''Halo'' titles.<ref name=\"polygon-forge\"/> The studio developed the Forge mode, co-developed War Games and created a number of maps and multiplayer modes for ''Halo 4''.<ref name=\"EuroG - certainaffinity\"/>\n\n''Halo 4'' and ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary]]'' were both officially announced on June 6, 2011, at the [[E3 2011]].<ref name=\"IGNe32011\" /> ''Halo 4'' is the first installment in the Reclaimer Saga of ''Halo'' games.<ref name=\"Gspot - saga\" /> The studio's creative team, which included nearly 200 people led by creative director [[Josh Holmes (video game designer)|Josh Holmes]], started developing the game as early as 2009.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\" /><ref name=\"h4panel\" /> Prior to the release of the game, Microsoft Studios Vice President [[Phil Spencer (Microsoft)|Phil Spencer]] stated that the ''Halo'' franchise is the \"most important entertainment product in the company\" and that ''Halo 4'' was the most expensive game that Microsoft had made.<ref name=\"polygon - playtest\"/> A demonstration of the game's campaign was first shown at [[E3 2012]]. The developers described it as a pivotal moment in development, as it was the first time the game had been shown publicly. The positive reaction was a morale boost for the team, who were unsure how the public would react.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_3\"/> On July 7, 2012, a pre-release build of ''Halo 4''{{'}}s Forge mode was showcased by 343 Industries and Certain Affinity at [[Rooster Teeth Productions#RTX|RTX]] which took place at the [[Austin Convention Center]].<ref name=\"polygon-forge\"/><ref name=\"EuroG - certainaffinity\"/><ref name=\"bulletin71812\" /> On September 26, 2012, O'Connor announced that the game's development was complete.<ref name=\"Halo4complete\" />\n\n===Design===\n<!-- master chiefs return, covenant's return: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/will-halo-4s-next-gen-successors-kick-some-ass-absolutely-says-343s-scott-warner-8021773.html http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/181319/Halo_4s_look_came_from_artistic_obsession.php#.UQPu9L9LMmK-->\nFollowing ''Halo 4''{{'}}s announcement, O'Connor reported that both Master Chief and Cortana would undergo \"radical\" changes in appearance for the game, some of them attributed to better graphics and others to story elements.<ref name=\"cvg - trilogy\" /> The studio wanted Master Chief's appearance to convey an imposing mass and weight, to show that one of his characteristics is his {{convert|800|lb|kg|adj=on}} armor.<ref name=\"gamasutra - art\" /><ref name=\"bulletin21512\" /> They studied the armor changes that were made for the Spartans in ''Halo: Reach'', which were much bulkier than renditions in previous ''Halo'' games.<ref name=\"bulletin21512\"/> Character and concept artists began redesigning the Master Chief by creating sketches; these sketches would be rendered into [[3D modeling|3D models]] so the team could analyze the design from every possible angle. The team would then return to creating sketches to make adjustments, and repeat the process until the main structure for the Master Chief was created. The team then worked on the finer details of his appearance.<ref name=\"gamasutra - art\"/><ref name=\"heroawakens\" /><ref name=\"verge - concept art\" />\n\nDuring the concepting process of ''Halo 4'', O'Connor decided it would be best for the franchise to explore the Forerunner fiction of the ''Halo'' universe, which had remained largely a mystery before 343 Industries' involvement in the franchise.<ref name=\"GI - developing343\"/> This ultimately led to the creation of a new race of enemy, the Prometheans, warriors of the Forerunner empire.<ref name=\"bulletin91212\" /> Given that the Forerunners themselves had never been featured in previous ''Halo'' games, the design process for the appearance of the Prometheans was long and tedious. The art team produced a large number of sketches, which were presented to other members of the studio to get feedback and reactions. Many variations of different character models were considered before the team decided on a final design.<ref name=\"gamasutra - art\"/><ref name=\"verge - concept art\"/><ref name=\"bulletin91212\"/> The main goal when designing their appearance was to make them resonate with the player, and evoke the image of the Forerunner architecture and language that had been portrayed in previous ''Halo'' media. Upon death, the Promethean Knight dissolves from the point where it was last shot; this visual effect also occurs when certain enemies are killed by Promethean weapons. From a gameplay standpoint the design for the Prometheans also needed to fit in well with the sandbox so they would be suitable enemies to fight. A goal when designing their behavior was to make them highly adaptive from a tactical standpoint. For example, the Promethean Knight can phase in and out of space, allowing it to retreat or charge the player at any given moment; this changes the way that a player engages in a combat encounter.<ref name=\"bulletin91212\"/>\n\nHolmes explained that one of the goals for ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign was to incorporate more human elements into the story. To accomplish this the team wrote a [[Subplot|B story]] that explored Master Chief's relationship with his AI partner, Cortana, who would break down into a [[dementia]]-like state.<ref name=\"Gspot - story\" /> The development team realized that ''Halo 4''{{'}}s narrative could be dense and hard to approach, making it inaccessible for new players.<ref name=\"gamasutra-AAA_2\"/> They found incorporating such a storyline into an action game to be extremely challenging and considered dropping it during development. Holmes was adamant about including it; he took inspiration from his mother's battle with dementia, which she was diagnosed with near the start of the game's development. This led Holmes to want to capture the emotion and tell \"a perfect story\".<ref name=\"Gspot - story\"/>\n\n[[File:Halo4 concept.png|thumb|left|A piece of concept art showing the gravity-defying architecture and scenery of the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] planet, Requiem]]\nThe senior art director for ''Halo 4'' is Kenneth Scott; he described the visual style of ''Halo 4'' as being more ingrained in the expanded universe fiction, and more \"mature\" than before.<ref name=\"h4panel\"/><ref name=\"polycount - art1\" /> With the game's increased focus on the Forerunners, the artists invested heavily into the look and feel of Forerunner technology. The game also features more diversity in Forerunner structures, including fully active Forerunner technology as opposed to the mostly inert and abandoned structures seen in the earlier games.<ref name=\"h4panel\"/><ref name=\"polycount - art2\" /><ref name=\"polycount - art3\" /> The majority of the game is lit statically using [[lightmap]]s; this allowed the art team to achieve realistic lighting effects with full [[global illumination]] and [[ambient occlusion]]. [[Image-based lighting]] is also used to ground scenes and make everything fit together better.<ref name=\"polycount - art1\"/>\n\n<!--http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/18/3889526/halo-4-spartan-ops-episodes-6-10, http://www.gamedesignexpo.com/2013/02/the-making-of-halo-4s-episodic-co-op-adventure-spartan-ops-2/ -->\nThe cooperative Spartan Ops mode originally began as a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in ''Halo: Reach'', but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a narrative that would tie ''Halo 4''{{'}}s multiplayer together. The missions were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode such that the cinematics would tie in with the missions.<ref name=\"bulletin112112\" />\n\n<!--good source to use here: http://www.3dworldmag.com/2013/03/26/cool-cg-halo-4-spartan-ops/, http://www.fxguide.com/featured/the-making-of-halo-4-spartan-ops/ -->\n[[Glasgow]] based animation studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on the creation of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for ''[[Dead Island]]''. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in [[live action]] using [[performance capture]]. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the [[Computer animation|3D animation]] package, [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], to [[Procedural generation|procedurally generate]] the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based [[audio post production]] company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics.<ref name=\"awn - axis1\" /> [[Facial motion capture]] was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios.<ref name=\"heroawakens\"/><ref name=\"awn - axis1\"/> Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.<ref name=\"awn - axis1\"/>\n\nVisual effects house The Sequence Group, who had previously developed animation for ''Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary''{{'}}s terminals,<ref name=\"sequence\" /> returned to create additional animation for ''Halo 4''. The Terminals feature a painterly artistic style, which Sequence president Ian Kirby felt appealed to gamers familiar with the style of [[concept art]]. In addition to creating the visuals for the ''Halo 4'' terminals, their work appeared in one of the game's main cinematics. To save time and expense using traditional motion capture methods to animate the 3D characters, The Sequence Group used twin Microsoft [[Kinect]] infrared sensors to create a home-made solution.<ref name=\"fxguide_mocap\" />\n\nThe game utilizes much of the \"sandbox\" that has been featured across all six prior ''Halo'' games and other media, in addition to introducing new characters, weapons, vehicles, and other elements.<ref name=\"h4panel\"/> The game engine used is a heavily modified version of the engine established by Bungie.

He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted ''Halo 4''{{'}}s campaign, in the same way that they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for ''Halo 2'' on the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in ''Halo 3''{{'}}s campaign.

He also thought that the multiplayer component was more approachable to people outside of the core player-base without dumbing anything down.<ref name=\"polygon - review\" />\n\n<!-- spartan ops -->\nReception towards Spartan Ops was less favorable than multiplayer and campaign; some reviewers expressed their disappointment in Spartan Ops replacing the cooperative Firefight mode.<ref name=\"1UP - review\"/><ref name=\"GI_review\" /> Criticisms were aimed at the brevity of missions and lack of replay value.<ref name=\"IGN - review\"/><ref name=\"GSpot_review\" /> Despite any shortcomings, IGN said the mode was a must-play for the \"incredible pre-episode cinematics\" which open up \"a number of interesting narrative possibilities for future episodes and seasons.\"<ref name=\"IGN - review\"/> Martin Robinson of Eurogamer complained about the repetition of environments within the first half of the season and noted that missions quickly become a chore. He felt that Spartan Ops was a \"weak, bloated alternative\" compared to Firefight.<ref name=\"eurog_spartan_ops\" /> ''1UP.com'' found that while the short length felt odd initially, the mode was still fun to play and offered more opportunities to play ''Halo'' cooperatively.<ref name=\"1UP - review\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n<!-- add prose/summary: http://www.torontosun.com/2012/12/19/seth-macfarlane-qmi-agencys-entertainer-of-12 http://www.gamemarketingsummit.com/awards/winners/-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ List of pre-release awards and nominations\n|-\n!
