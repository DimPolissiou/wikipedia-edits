It was the sixth round of the [[2002 Formula One World Championship]] and the 25th Austrian Grand Prix as part of the Formula One World Championship. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race after starting from third position. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second, and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] took third for the [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team.\n\nBarrichello started the race from the [[pole position]] after recording the fastest lap in qualifying; Williams driver [[Ralf Schumacher]] started second, but was passed by Michael Schumacher in the first corner. Barrichello maintained the lead through most of the race until Ferrari invoked [[team orders]] on him to allow Michael Schumacher to win the race on the final lap and improve his standing in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]]. It was his first Austrian Grand Prix victory, his fourth in a row in the 2002 season and the 58th of his career. The [[safety car]] was deployed twice during the race, which included a major accident on lap 28 involving [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] driver [[Takuma Sato]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] of the [[Sauber Motorsport|Sauber]] team, who both sustained light injuries.\n\nAt the post-race podium ceremony Michael Schumacher implored Barrichello to mount the stand reserved for the race winner and gave his first-place trophy to his teammate. That led the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA; Formula One's governing body) to fine Ferrari, Michael Schumacher and Barrichello $1 million on 26 June; each paid a third immediately, while the remainder was suspended. Following a review, the FIA banned the practice of team orders beginning with the [[2003 Formula One World Championship|2003 season]]; they began again allowing the practice following the [[2010 Formula One World Championship|2010 championship]].\n\nThe win increased Michael Schumacher's lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 27 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Montoya in second place. Ralf Schumacher came fourth to maintain third place, and Barrichello moved past [[David Coulthard]] of the [[McLaren]] team to fourth. In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]], Ferrari further extended their advantage over Williams to 16 points. McLaren were another 36 points behind in third as [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] and Sauber battled for fourth with eleven races remaining in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Red Bull Ring, April 18, 2018 SkySat.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Aerial photograph of the AI Ring, now called the Red Bull Ring, where the race was held | The [[Red Bull Ring|A1 Ring]], now called the Red Bull Ring ''(pictured in 2018)'', where the race was held.]]\n\nThe 2002 [[Austrian Grand Prix]] was the 6th of 17 motor races in the [[2002 Formula One World Championship]],<ref name=\"CF1Overview\" /> and the 25th time it formed part of the championship.<ref name=CrashPreview>{{cite web|title=Preview \u2013 Austrian Grand Prix 2002|url=https://www.crash.net/f1/preview/42080/1/preview-austrian-grand-prix-2002|publisher=Crash|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The 71-lap race was held at the 9-turn {{Convert|4.326|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Red Bull Ring|A1 Ring]] in [[Spielberg, Styria]], on 12 May 2002.<ref name=\"CF1Overview\" /><ref name=\"CrashPreview\" /> With very few sections requiring drivers competitors to slow down, the track gives teams an opportunity to push their engines to their full potential. 70 percent of the lap can be driven at full racing speed, although the circuit's relatively high altitude of {{Convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} offers less oxygen to feed the combustion engines, reducing their performance by approximately seven percent.<ref name=\"CrashPreview\" />\n\nHaving won four of the season's five previous races, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] led the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 44 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]].

It was the sixth round of the [[2002 Formula One World Championship]] and the 25th Austrian Grand Prix as part of the Formula One World Championship. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race after starting from third position. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second, and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] took third for the [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team.\n\nBarrichello started the race from the [[pole position]] after recording the fastest lap in qualifying; Williams driver [[Ralf Schumacher]] started second, but was passed by Michael Schumacher in the first corner. Barrichello maintained the lead through most of the race until Ferrari invoked [[team orders]] on him to allow Michael Schumacher to win the race on the final lap and improve his standing in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]]. It was his first Austrian Grand Prix victory, his fourth in a row in the 2002 season and the 58th of his career. The [[safety car]] was deployed twice during the race, which included a major accident on lap 28 involving [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] driver [[Takuma Sato]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] of the [[Sauber Motorsport|Sauber]] team, who both sustained light injuries.\n\nAt the post-race podium ceremony Michael Schumacher implored Barrichello to mount the stand reserved for the race winner and gave his first-place trophy to his teammate. That led the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA; Formula One's governing body) to fine Ferrari, Michael Schumacher and Barrichello $1 million on 26 June; each paid a third immediately, while the remainder was suspended. Following a review, the FIA banned the practice of team orders beginning with the [[2003 Formula One World Championship|2003 season]]; they began again allowing the practice following the [[2010 Formula One World Championship|2010 championship]].\n\nThe win increased Michael Schumacher's lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 27 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Montoya in second place. Ralf Schumacher came fourth to maintain third place, and Barrichello moved past [[David Coulthard]] of the [[McLaren]] team to fourth. In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]], Ferrari further extended their advantage over Williams to 16 points. McLaren were another 36 points behind in third as [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] and Sauber battled for fourth with eleven races remaining in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Red Bull Ring, April 18, 2018 SkySat.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Aerial photograph of the AI Ring, now called the Red Bull Ring, where the race was held | The [[Red Bull Ring|A1 Ring]], now called the Red Bull Ring ''(pictured in 2018)'', where the race was held.]]\n\nThe 2002 [[Austrian Grand Prix]] was the 6th of 17 motor races in the [[2002 Formula One World Championship]],<ref name=\"CF1Overview\" /> and the 25th time it formed part of the championship.<ref name=CrashPreview>{{cite web|title=Preview \u2013 Austrian Grand Prix 2002|url=https://www.crash.net/f1/preview/42080/1/preview-austrian-grand-prix-2002|publisher=Crash|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The 71-lap race was held at the 9-turn {{Convert|4.326|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Red Bull Ring|A1 Ring]] in [[Spielberg, Styria]], on 12 May 2002.<ref name=\"CF1Overview\" /><ref name=\"CrashPreview\" /> With very few sections requiring drivers competitors to slow down, the track gives teams an opportunity to push their engines to their full potential. 70 percent of the lap can be driven at full racing speed, although the circuit's relatively high altitude of {{Convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} offers less oxygen to feed the combustion engines, reducing their performance by approximately seven percent.<ref name=\"CrashPreview\" />\n\nHaving won four of the season's five previous races, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] led the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 44 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]].

Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator.

In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator.

The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy.

They lost badly but in 1934 the three communities formed the [[Triveni Sangh]] political party, which allegedly had a million dues-paying members by 1936. However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed [[Backward Class]] Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior.

Initially billed as \"Stymee\" on the 1989 album ''[[Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', Trujillo remained in the band until the mid-1990s. Concurrent to his work with Suicidal Tendencies, Trujillo was also a member of the band's side project, [[Infectious Grooves]], along with vocalist [[Mike Muir]].\n\nTrujillo was a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band for a number of years starting in the late 1990s.

He had previously met and befriended his future bandmates when [[Suicidal Tendencies]] supported Metallica during the [[Nowhere Else to Roam]] tour in 1993, and again during the [[Shit Hits the Sheds Tour|Shit Hits the Sheds]] tour one year later. Trujillo received one million dollars from the band as an advance for joining Metallica. His audition and hiring as well as his million dollar payment offer appeared in the documentary film ''[[Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]''.

At many of the shows during Metallica's 2004 [[Madly in Anger with the World Tour]], Trujillo would often play an extended bass solo (dubbed \"Jungle Essence\" on recordings), which made extensive use of slap bass and other techniques and effects.\n\nFor recording purposes, Trujillo uses his own code for writing down bass arrangements. Inspired by an article by [[Pino Palladino]], he developed this during the recording sessions for Jerry Cantrell's ''[[Degradation Trip]]'', which, according to Trujillo, had him working from \"little hoodrat demos\" with nearly inaudible bass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassguitarmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=156:robert-trujillo-metallica-bgm-issue-32&catid=43:artist-interviews&Itemid=70|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132808/http://www.bassguitarmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=156:robert-trujillo-metallica-bgm-issue-32&catid=43:artist-interviews&Itemid=70|archivedate=April 2, 2012|title=Robert Trujillo \u2013 Metallica|publisher=[[Bass Guitar (magazine)|Bass Guitar]]|date=September\u2013October 2007|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Bass guitars===\nWith Metallica, Trujillo has primarily been playing [[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick]] Streamer bass guitars, both 5 and 4-strings.

Initially billed as \"Stymee\" on the 1989 album ''[[Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', Trujillo remained in the band until the mid-1990s. Concurrent to his work with Suicidal Tendencies, Trujillo was also a member of the band's side project, [[Infectious Grooves]], along with vocalist [[Mike Muir]].\n\nTrujillo was a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band for a number of years starting in the late 1990s. In contrast to his earlier jazz and funk inspired playing, Osbourne's band was more straightforward to hard rock and metal.<ref name=\"Jeff Ho, Juice interview\">Jeff Ho, ''Juice'' interview.</ref> Trujillo also co-wrote several songs on the ''[[Down to Earth (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Down to Earth]]'' album.<ref name=\"Jeff Ho, Juice interview\"/> He was the subject of controversy for re-recording [[Bob Daisley]]'s bass tracks for reissued versions of Osbourne's first two solo albums ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' (1980) and ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]'' (1981) after Daisley claimed that he was not paid proper royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/osbourneozzy-blizzard/ |title=Ozzy Osbourne \u2013 Blizzard of Ozz / Diary of a Madman |last=Begrand |first=Adrien |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=24 October 2015 }}</ref> During this time, Trujillo formed an experimental supergroup, [[Mass Mental]], with then [[Dub War]] singer [[Benji Webbe]], whose \"ragga-punk-metal\" outfit had just disbanded.

He had previously met and befriended his future bandmates when [[Suicidal Tendencies]] supported Metallica during the [[Nowhere Else to Roam]] tour in 1993, and again during the [[Shit Hits the Sheds Tour|Shit Hits the Sheds]] tour one year later. Trujillo received one million dollars from the band as an advance for joining Metallica. His audition and hiring as well as his million dollar payment offer appeared in the documentary film ''[[Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]''.

E.P. Milliken estimated that on the eve of the cyclone there were 43,500 people living in 12,000 dwellings in the Darwin area. Though building standards at the time required that some attention be given to the possibility of cyclones, most buildings were not capable of withstanding the force of a cyclone's direct hit.\n\nOn the day of the cyclone, most residents of Darwin believed that the cyclone would not cause any damage to the city. [[Cyclone Selma]] had been predicted to hit Darwin earlier in the month, but it instead went north and dissipated without affecting Darwin in any way. As a result, Cyclone Tracy took most Darwin residents by surprise. Despite several warnings the people of Darwin did not evacuate or prepare for the cyclone. Many residents continued to prepare for Christmas, and many attended Christmas parties, despite the increasing winds and heavy rain. Journalist Bill Bunbury interviewed the residents of Darwin some time later <!-- will find out when --> and recorded the experiences of the survivors of the cyclone in his book ''Cyclone Tracy, picking up the pieces''.<ref name=\"Bunbury\">{{cite book |last=Bunbury |first=Bill |year=1994 |title=Cyclone Tracy, picking up the pieces | location=Fremantle, Western Australia |publisher= Fremantle Arts Centre Press |isbn=1-86368-112-4}}</ref> Resident Dawn Lawrie, a 1971 independent candidate for the electorate of [[Nightcliff, Northern Territory|Nightcliff]], told him:\n\n{{cquote|''We'd had a cyclone warning only 10 days before Tracy [that another cyclone] was coming, it was coming, and it never came.

At Darwin Airport, thirty-one aircraft were destroyed and another twenty-five badly damaged.<ref name=bigblow2 /> The initial estimate put the reported death toll at 65, but it was revised upwards in March 2005 to 71, when the [[Northern Territory]] Coroner proclaimed that those six who still remained listed as missing had \"perished at sea\".<ref name=\"Deathtoll\" /><ref name=EMAtctracy />\n\nSeveral factors delayed the dissemination of the news of the cyclone's impact. The destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between Darwin and the rest of the Australian population played a role, as did the fact the storm made landfall on [[Christmas Day]] and most media outlets had only a skeleton crew rostered on at best. Most Australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon.  Dick Muddimer, a reporter for the local [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] station, [[105.7 ABC Darwin|8DR]], was able to travel through the wreckage to local television station [[NTD (television station)|NTD]] and had the ABC station in [[Mount Isa]], Queensland notify ABC headquarters in [[Sydney]] that Darwin had been hit by a cyclone.<ref name=ABCHistory>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161022013911/http://www.abc.net.au/darwin/about History of 105.7 ABC Darwin] from ABC Online</ref>\n\nIn order to provide the initial emergency response, a committee was created. The committee, composed of several high-level public servants and police, stated that, \"Darwin had, for the time being, ceased to exist as a city\". [[Gough Whitlam]], the Australian Prime Minister, was touring [[Syracuse, Sicily]] at the time and flew to Darwin upon hearing of the disaster. Additionally, the Australian government began a mass evacuation by road and air; all of the [[Australian Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel throughout Australia, along with the entire [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s fleet of transport planes, were recalled from holiday leave and deployed to evacuate civilians from Darwin, as well as to bring essential relief supplies to the area. Thirteen RAN ships were used to transport supplies to the area as part of [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]]; the largest humanitarian or disaster relief operation ever performed by the Navy.<ref name=\"Semaphore 14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |title=Disaster Relief&nbsp;\u2014 Cyclone Tracy and Tasman Bridge |publisher=Sea Power Centre |work=Semaphore |accessdate=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531125906/http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Health and essential services crisis===\nAs soon as the worst of the storm had passed, Darwin faced several immediate health crises. On Christmas Day, the Darwin Hospital treated well over five hundred patients, with 112 of these being admitted into the hospital, and both of the facility's operating theatres being utilised. The first casualties did not arrive till 7 a.m. because of high winds and severe road conditions in and around the Darwin area. Operating continued throughout the night and into the early morning. Local teams worked without relief until the arrival of a surgical team from Canberra late that day. Those who were considered unable to return to work within two weeks were evacuated by air to safer locations.\n\nAll official communications out of Darwin were no longer operational. The antennas at the OTC Coastal Radio Service station (callsign VID) were destroyed during the storm. Station manager Bob Hooper, who was an [[amateur radio operator]], helped to establish communications using his own equipment. By 10 a.m. Gary Gibson, another amateur operator, was able to establish a station at the Darwin Community College, and within a short period of time a network of stations was established across the country. This network, coordinated by Melbourne D24 police, provided message services to the cities of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, [[Townsville]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Alice Springs]], Gove, Mt Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, MacKay, Lismore, and Cooma.<ref>Electronics Australia magazine March 1975</ref> By 10:40&nbsp;a.m. VID operators had established VID2 on board the MV ''Nyanda'' in Darwin Harbour, and then for five days official communications traffic in and out of Darwin was handled via [[continuous wave]] radio ([[Morse code]]).  The only local radio station that wasn't completely disabled was the ABC's [[8DR]]. For the next two days, it was Darwin's only link to the outside world, and was on the air for all but 34 hours in the coming weeks.<ref name=ABCHistory/>\n\nThose who remained in Darwin faced the threat of several diseases due to much of the city being without water, electricity or basic sanitation. An initial response was to vaccinate residents for typhoid and cholera. Approximately 30,000 people were homeless, and were forced to seek shelter in several makeshift housing and emergency centres that lacked proper hygienic conditions. Volunteers came in from across the country to assist with the emergency relief efforts. Trench [[latrine]]s were dug; water supplies delivered by tankers, and mass immunisation programs begun. The army was given the task of searching houses for bodies of people and animals, as well as locating other health risks; for example, cleaning out rotting contents from fridges and freezers across the city. This was completed within a week. Houses which had been 'searched and cleared' had S&C painted on an external wall. The city itself was sprayed with [[malathion]] to control mosquitoes and other similar pests.\n\nAttempts to reconnect the essential services to the city began on Christmas Day. Local officers from the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction began clearing debris and working to restore power. They sealed off damaged water hydrants and activated pumps to reactivate the city's water and sewerage systems.\n\n===Evacuation and the public response===\nMajor-General [[Alan Stretton]], Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organisation,<ref name=naaTCtracy /> and the Commonwealth Minister for the Northern Territory, [[Rex Patterson]], arrived at Darwin Airport late on Christmas Day and took charge of the relief efforts. After an assessment of the situation and meetings with the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant minister, it was concluded that Darwin's population needed to be reduced to a \"safe level\" of 10,500 people. This decision was made on the advice of Dr. Charles Gurd, the Director of Health in the Northern Territory. Around 10,000 people left Darwin and the surrounding area within the first two days, but the rate of departures then began to slow down. The government then gave support to his position, offering full reimbursement of personal costs, as long as the evacuation took place.\n\nThe population was evacuated by air and ground; because of communications difficulties with Darwin airport, landing was limited to one plane every ninety minutes. At major airports, teams of federal and territory department officials as well as [[Salvation Army]] and [[Red Cross]] workers met refugees, with the Red Cross taking responsibility for keeping track of the names and temporary addresses of the refugees. Evacuations were prioritised according to need; women, children, and the elderly and sick were evacuated first. There were reports of men dressing up as women to escape with the early evacuations. Between 26 and 31 December, a total of 35,362 people were evacuated from Darwin.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|title=Big Blow up North|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|publisher=University Planning Authority|accessdate=4 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228171040/http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|archive-date=28 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Of those, 25,628 were evacuated by air, the remainder by road.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2 /> By 31 December, only 10,638 people (mostly men who were required to help clean up the city) remained in Darwin. Stretton also regulated access to the city by means of a permit system. Permits were only issued to those who were involved in either the relief or reconstruction efforts, and were used to prevent the early return of those who had been evacuated.\n\nUpon receiving news of the damage, several community groups across Australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors. Major reception centres were set up in cities such as [[Katherine]], [[Tennant Creek]] and Alice Springs. Several of the small towns along the Stuart Highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road, supplying them with food, fuel, rest and mechanical aid. At [[Adelaide River]], the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there. Approximately twenty-four hours after the storm hit Darwin, the population of Alice Springs had raised over $105,000 to assist the victims of Tracy.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=Cyclone Tracy hits Darwin |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |accessdate=5 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182152/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In Melbourne at the [[Boxing Day Test]] [[cricket]] match between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], members of both teams moved around the boundaries carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds. Darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists. On 31 December 1974, Stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in Darwin, and handed over control of the city to its elected officials.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Reconstruction and effects on Darwin===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\nIn February 1975, Whitlam announced the creation of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which was given the task of rebuilding the city \"within five years\", focusing primarily on building houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|first=Bruce|last=Juddery|author-link=Bruce Juddery|title=Reconstruction Commission: Doubt and disillusion grows in Darwin|page=2|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=9 May 1975|access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002162631/http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Commission was headed by Tony Powell.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Alan|title=The bushfire recovery|work=Macquarie Media Network|publisher=2GB|date=17 February 2009|url=http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|accessdate=5 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712142846/http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|archive-date=12 July 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The damage to the city was so severe that some advocated moving the entire city. However, the government insisted that it be rebuilt in the same location. By May 1975, Darwin's population had recovered somewhat, with 30,000 residing in the city. Temporary housing, caravans, hotels and an [[ocean liner]], [[MV Bloemfontein Castle|MV ''Patris'']], were used to house people, as reconstruction of permanent housing had not yet begun by September that year. [[Ella Stack]] became Mayor of Darwin in May 1975 and was heavily involved in its reconstruction.\n\nHowever, by the following April, and after receiving criticism for the slow speed of reconstruction, the Commission had built 3,000 new homes in the nearly destroyed northern suburbs, and completed repairs to those that had survived the storm. Several new [[building codes]] were drawn up, trying to achieve the competing goals of the speedy recovery of the area and ensuring that there would be no repeat of the damage that Darwin took in 1974. By 1978, much of the city had recovered and was able to house almost the same number of people as it had before the cyclone hit. However, by the 1980s, as many as sixty percent of Darwin's 1974 population had left, never to return. In the years that followed, Darwin was almost entirely rebuilt and now shows almost no resemblance to the pre-Tracy Darwin of December 1974.\n\nAlthough a [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] had been set up earlier in the year, the Northern Territory had only minimal self-government, with a federal minister being responsible for the Territory from Canberra. However, the cyclone and subsequent responses highlighted several problems with the way the regional government was set up.

E.P. Milliken estimated that on the eve of the cyclone there were 43,500 people living in 12,000 dwellings in the Darwin area. Though building standards at the time required that some attention be given to the possibility of cyclones, most buildings were not capable of withstanding the force of a cyclone's direct hit.\n\nOn the day of the cyclone, most residents of Darwin believed that the cyclone would not cause any damage to the city. [[Cyclone Selma]] had been predicted to hit Darwin earlier in the month, but it instead went north and dissipated without affecting Darwin in any way. As a result, Cyclone Tracy took most Darwin residents by surprise. Despite several warnings the people of Darwin did not evacuate or prepare for the cyclone. Many residents continued to prepare for Christmas, and many attended Christmas parties, despite the increasing winds and heavy rain.

At Darwin Airport, thirty-one aircraft were destroyed and another twenty-five badly damaged.<ref name=bigblow2 /> The initial estimate put the reported death toll at 65, but it was revised upwards in March 2005 to 71, when the [[Northern Territory]] Coroner proclaimed that those six who still remained listed as missing had \"perished at sea\".<ref name=\"Deathtoll\" /><ref name=EMAtctracy />\n\nSeveral factors delayed the dissemination of the news of the cyclone's impact. The destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between Darwin and the rest of the Australian population played a role, as did the fact the storm made landfall on [[Christmas Day]] and most media outlets had only a skeleton crew rostered on at best. Most Australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon.  Dick Muddimer, a reporter for the local [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] station, [[105.7 ABC Darwin|8DR]], was able to travel through the wreckage to local television station [[NTD (television station)|NTD]] and had the ABC station in [[Mount Isa]], Queensland notify ABC headquarters in [[Sydney]] that Darwin had been hit by a cyclone.<ref name=ABCHistory>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161022013911/http://www.abc.net.au/darwin/about History of 105.7 ABC Darwin] from ABC Online</ref>\n\nIn order to provide the initial emergency response, a committee was created. The committee, composed of several high-level public servants and police, stated that, \"Darwin had, for the time being, ceased to exist as a city\". [[Gough Whitlam]], the Australian Prime Minister, was touring [[Syracuse, Sicily]] at the time and flew to Darwin upon hearing of the disaster. Additionally, the Australian government began a mass evacuation by road and air; all of the [[Australian Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel throughout Australia, along with the entire [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s fleet of transport planes, were recalled from holiday leave and deployed to evacuate civilians from Darwin, as well as to bring essential relief supplies to the area. Thirteen RAN ships were used to transport supplies to the area as part of [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]]; the largest humanitarian or disaster relief operation ever performed by the Navy.<ref name=\"Semaphore 14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |title=Disaster Relief&nbsp;\u2014 Cyclone Tracy and Tasman Bridge |publisher=Sea Power Centre |work=Semaphore |accessdate=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531125906/http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Health and essential services crisis===\nAs soon as the worst of the storm had passed, Darwin faced several immediate health crises. On Christmas Day, the Darwin Hospital treated well over five hundred patients, with 112 of these being admitted into the hospital, and both of the facility's operating theatres being utilised. The first casualties did not arrive till 7 a.m. because of high winds and severe road conditions in and around the Darwin area. Operating continued throughout the night and into the early morning. Local teams worked without relief until the arrival of a surgical team from Canberra late that day. Those who were considered unable to return to work within two weeks were evacuated by air to safer locations.\n\nAll official communications out of Darwin were no longer operational. The antennas at the OTC Coastal Radio Service station (callsign VID) were destroyed during the storm. Station manager Bob Hooper, who was an [[amateur radio operator]], helped to establish communications using his own equipment. By 10 a.m. Gary Gibson, another amateur operator, was able to establish a station at the Darwin Community College, and within a short period of time a network of stations was established across the country. This network, coordinated by Melbourne D24 police, provided message services to the cities of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, [[Townsville]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Alice Springs]], Gove, Mt Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, MacKay, Lismore, and Cooma.<ref>Electronics Australia magazine March 1975</ref> By 10:40&nbsp;a.m. VID operators had established VID2 on board the MV ''Nyanda'' in Darwin Harbour, and then for five days official communications traffic in and out of Darwin was handled via [[continuous wave]] radio ([[Morse code]]).  The only local radio station that wasn't completely disabled was the ABC's [[8DR]]. For the next two days, it was Darwin's only link to the outside world, and was on the air for all but 34 hours in the coming weeks.<ref name=ABCHistory/>\n\nThose who remained in Darwin faced the threat of several diseases due to much of the city being without water, electricity or basic sanitation. An initial response was to vaccinate residents for typhoid and cholera. Approximately 30,000 people were homeless, and were forced to seek shelter in several makeshift housing and emergency centres that lacked proper hygienic conditions. Volunteers came in from across the country to assist with the emergency relief efforts. Trench [[latrine]]s were dug; water supplies delivered by tankers, and mass immunisation programs begun. The army was given the task of searching houses for bodies of people and animals, as well as locating other health risks; for example, cleaning out rotting contents from fridges and freezers across the city. This was completed within a week. Houses which had been 'searched and cleared' had S&C painted on an external wall. The city itself was sprayed with [[malathion]] to control mosquitoes and other similar pests.\n\nAttempts to reconnect the essential services to the city began on Christmas Day. Local officers from the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction began clearing debris and working to restore power. They sealed off damaged water hydrants and activated pumps to reactivate the city's water and sewerage systems.\n\n===Evacuation and the public response===\nMajor-General [[Alan Stretton]], Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organisation,<ref name=naaTCtracy /> and the Commonwealth Minister for the Northern Territory, [[Rex Patterson]], arrived at Darwin Airport late on Christmas Day and took charge of the relief efforts. After an assessment of the situation and meetings with the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant minister, it was concluded that Darwin's population needed to be reduced to a \"safe level\" of 10,500 people. This decision was made on the advice of Dr. Charles Gurd, the Director of Health in the Northern Territory. Around 10,000 people left Darwin and the surrounding area within the first two days, but the rate of departures then began to slow down. The government then gave support to his position, offering full reimbursement of personal costs, as long as the evacuation took place.\n\nThe population was evacuated by air and ground; because of communications difficulties with Darwin airport, landing was limited to one plane every ninety minutes. At major airports, teams of federal and territory department officials as well as [[Salvation Army]] and [[Red Cross]] workers met refugees, with the Red Cross taking responsibility for keeping track of the names and temporary addresses of the refugees. Evacuations were prioritised according to need; women, children, and the elderly and sick were evacuated first. There were reports of men dressing up as women to escape with the early evacuations. Between 26 and 31 December, a total of 35,362 people were evacuated from Darwin.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|title=Big Blow up North|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|publisher=University Planning Authority|accessdate=4 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228171040/http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|archive-date=28 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Of those, 25,628 were evacuated by air, the remainder by road.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2 /> By 31 December, only 10,638 people (mostly men who were required to help clean up the city) remained in Darwin. Stretton also regulated access to the city by means of a permit system. Permits were only issued to those who were involved in either the relief or reconstruction efforts, and were used to prevent the early return of those who had been evacuated.\n\nUpon receiving news of the damage, several community groups across Australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors. Major reception centres were set up in cities such as [[Katherine]], [[Tennant Creek]] and Alice Springs. Several of the small towns along the Stuart Highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road, supplying them with food, fuel, rest and mechanical aid. At [[Adelaide River]], the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there. Approximately twenty-four hours after the storm hit Darwin, the population of Alice Springs had raised over $105,000 to assist the victims of Tracy.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=Cyclone Tracy hits Darwin |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |accessdate=5 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182152/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In Melbourne at the [[Boxing Day Test]] [[cricket]] match between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], members of both teams moved around the boundaries carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds. Darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists. On 31 December 1974, Stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in Darwin, and handed over control of the city to its elected officials.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Reconstruction and effects on Darwin===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\nIn February 1975, Whitlam announced the creation of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which was given the task of rebuilding the city \"within five years\", focusing primarily on building houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|first=Bruce|last=Juddery|author-link=Bruce Juddery|title=Reconstruction Commission: Doubt and disillusion grows in Darwin|page=2|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=9 May 1975|access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002162631/http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Commission was headed by Tony Powell.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Alan|title=The bushfire recovery|work=Macquarie Media Network|publisher=2GB|date=17 February 2009|url=http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|accessdate=5 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712142846/http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|archive-date=12 July 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The damage to the city was so severe that some advocated moving the entire city. However, the government insisted that it be rebuilt in the same location. By May 1975, Darwin's population had recovered somewhat, with 30,000 residing in the city. Temporary housing, caravans, hotels and an [[ocean liner]], [[MV Bloemfontein Castle|MV ''Patris'']], were used to house people, as reconstruction of permanent housing had not yet begun by September that year. [[Ella Stack]] became Mayor of Darwin in May 1975 and was heavily involved in its reconstruction.\n\nHowever, by the following April, and after receiving criticism for the slow speed of reconstruction, the Commission had built 3,000 new homes in the nearly destroyed northern suburbs, and completed repairs to those that had survived the storm. Several new [[building codes]] were drawn up, trying to achieve the competing goals of the speedy recovery of the area and ensuring that there would be no repeat of the damage that Darwin took in 1974. By 1978, much of the city had recovered and was able to house almost the same number of people as it had before the cyclone hit. However, by the 1980s, as many as sixty percent of Darwin's 1974 population had left, never to return. In the years that followed, Darwin was almost entirely rebuilt and now shows almost no resemblance to the pre-Tracy Darwin of December 1974.\n\nAlthough a [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] had been set up earlier in the year, the Northern Territory had only minimal self-government, with a federal minister being responsible for the Territory from Canberra. However, the cyclone and subsequent responses highlighted several problems with the way the regional government was set up.  This led [[Malcolm Fraser]], Whitlam's successor as Prime Minister, to give self-government to the Territory in 1978.\n\nMany of the government records associated with Cyclone Tracy became publicly available on 1 January 2005 under the [[30-year rule]].\n\n{{anchor|Cyclone Tracy in popular culture}}\n\n===In popular culture===\nCyclone Tracy inspired the song \"Santa Never Made It into Darwin\", composed by Bill Cate and performed by [[Bill and Boyd]] in 1975 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction efforts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Santa never made it, but song to help Darwin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5568,5099|accessdate=7 July 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=1 January 1975|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024212624/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5568,5099|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt |title=''Santa Never Made it into Darwin'' |author=Bill Cate |accessdate=24 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113436/http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref> In 1983 [[Hoodoo Gurus]] released \"[[Tojo (song)|Tojo]]\", a song comparing the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] bombing of Darwin under the command of [[Hideki Tojo]] during [[World War II]] to the damage done by Cyclone Tracy.

It is currently classified as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]]; and a second species, ''[[Giant aye-aye|Daubentonia robusta]]'', appears to have become [[extinct]] at some point within the last 1000 years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus ''Daubentonia'' was named after the French naturalist [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] by his student, [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name ''Scolecophagus'' (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}  In 1863, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] coined the family name Daubentoniidae.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nThe French naturalist [[Pierre Sonnerat]] was the first to use the vernacular name \"'''aye-aye'''\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"'''long-fingered lemur'''\" by English zoologist [[George Shaw]] in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"''cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement''\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel ''et al.'' (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"''heh heh''\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"''heh heh''\" to [[avoidance speech|avoid saying the name]] of a feared, magical animal.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==\nDue to its [[Cladistics|derived]] [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [[incisor]]s (front teeth) parallels those of [[rodent]]s, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [[Rodent]]ia{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}} and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.<ref name=Science>{{cite journal|title=The Aye-Ayes or Cheiromys of Madagascar|journal=Science|date=3 November 1881|volume=2|issue=75|pages=574\u2013576|doi=10.1126/science.os-2.76.574 |pmid=17791380}}</ref>\n\nThe aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain.  It has been considered a highly derived member of the family [[Indridae]], a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] branch of the [[strepsirrhine]] suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates.{{Sfn|Yoder|Vilgalys|Ruvolo|1996|pp=??}}  In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder '''Chiromyiformes''', a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [[Colin Groves]] upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a [[clade]] with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs.{{Sfn|Groves|2005|p=121}}\n\nHowever, molecular results have consistently placed Daubentoniidae as the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of [[Lemuroidea|lemurs]].<ref name=\"Del Pero1995\">{{cite journal|last1= Del Pero|first1= M.|last2= Crovella|first2= S.|last3= Cervella|first3= P.|last4= Ardito|first4= G.|last5= Rumpler|first5= Y.|title= Phylogenetic relationships among Malagasy lemurs as revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|year= 1995|pages= 431\u2013440|doi= 10.1007/BF02382865}}</ref><ref name=\"Porter1995\">{{cite journal|last1= Porter|first1= C.A.|last2= Sampaio|first2= I.|last3= Schneider|first3= H.|last4= Schneider|first4= M.P.C.|last5= Czelusniak|first5= J.|last6= Goodman|first6= M.|title= Evidence on primate phylogeny from \u03b5-globin gene sequences and flanking regions|journal= Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume= 40|issue= 1|year= 1995|pages= 30\u201355|doi= 10.1007/BF00166594}}</ref><ref name=\"Yoder1996\">{{cite journal|last1= Yoder|first1= A.D.|last2= Vilgalys|first2= R.|last3= Ruvolo|first3= M.|title= Molecular evolutionary dynamics of cytochrome b in strepsirrhine primates: the phylogenetic significance of third-position transversions |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume= 13|issue= 10|year= 1996|pages= 1339\u20131350|doi= 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025580}}</ref><ref name=\"Roos2004\">{{cite journal|last1= Roos|first1= C.|last2= Schmitz|first2= J.|last3= Zischler|first3= H.|title= Primate jumping genes elucidate strepsirrhine phylogeny |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 101|issue= 29|year= 2004|pages= 10650\u201310654|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0403852101|pmid= 15249661|pmc= 489989|bibcode= 2004PNAS..10110650R}}</ref><ref name=\"Horvath2008\">{{Cite journal |last1= Horvath |first1= J.E. |last2= Weisrock |first2= D.W. |last3= Embry |first3= S.L. |last4= Fiorentino |first4= I. |last5= Balhoff |first5= J.P. |last6= Kappeler |first6= P. |last7= Wray |first7= G.A. |last8= Willard |first8= H.F. |last9= Yoder |first9= A.D. |doi= 10.1101/gr.7265208 |title= Development and application of a phylogenomic toolkit: Resolving the evolutionary history of Madagascar's lemurs |journal= Genome Research |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 489\u2013499 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18245770|pmc= 2259113}}</ref><ref name=\"Orlando2008\">{{Cite journal |last1= Orlando |first1= L. |last2= Calvignac |first2= S. |last3= Schnebelen |first3= C. |last4= Douady |first4= C.J. |last5= Godfrey |first5= L.R. |last6= H\u00e4nni |first6= C. |doi= 10.1186/1471-2148-8-121 |title= DNA from extinct giant lemurs links archaeolemurids to extant indriids |journal= BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume= 8 |issue= 121 |pages= 121 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18442367|pmc= 2386821}}</ref><ref name=\"Brosius2011\">{{cite journal|last1= Brosius|first1= J.|last2= Perelman|first2= P.|last3= Johnson|first3= W.E.|last4= Roos|first4= C.|last5= Seu\u00e1nez|first5= H.N.|last6= Horvath|first6= J.E.|last7=Moreira|first7= M.A.M.|last8= Kessing|first8= B.|last9= Pontius|first9= J.|last10= Roelke|first10= M.|last11= Rumpler|first11= Y.|last12= Schneider|first12= M.P.C.|last13= Silva|first13= A.|last14= O'Brien|first14= S.J.|last15= Pecon-Slattery|first15= J.|title=A Molecular Phylogeny of Living Primates |journal= PLoS Genetics|volume= 7|issue= 3|year= 2011|pages= e1001342|doi= 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001342}}</ref><ref name=\"Perry2012\">{{cite journal|last1= Perry|first1= G.H.|last2= Reeves|first2= D.|last3= Melsted|first3= P.|last4= Ratan|first4= A.|last5= Miller|first5= W.|last6= Michelini|first6= K.|last7= Louis|first7= E.E.|last8= Pritchard|first8= J.K.|last9= Mason|first9= C.E.|last10= Gilad|first10= Y.|title=A Genome Sequence Resource for the Aye-Aye (''Daubentonia madagascariensis''), a Nocturnal Lemur from Madagascar |journal= Genome Biology and Evolution |volume= 4|issue= 2|year= 2012|pages= 126\u2013135|doi= 10.1093/gbe/evr132}}</ref>  The most parsimonious explanation for this is that all lemurs are derived from a single ancestor that [[Oceanic dispersal|rafted]] from Africa to Madagascar during the [[Paleogene]].<ref name=\"Roos2004\" /><ref name=Sellers>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225011846/http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/human-origins/PrimateEvolution.pdf | title = Primate Evolution | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | last = Sellers | first = Bill | date = 2000-10-20 | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | pages = 13\u201317}}</ref><ref name = \"Ali&Huber\">{{Cite journal | last = Ali | first = J.

However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\n\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers.<ref name=\"Perry2012\" /> The third finger, which is thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling bugs out of trees, using the hooked nail.<ref name=Science/> The middle finger is unique in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Anatomy of the hand and arm in Daubentonia madagascariensis: a functional and phylogenetic outlook|last = Soligo|first = C.|date = 2005|journal = Folia Primatol|volume = 76|issue = 5|pages = 262\u2013300|doi = 10.1159/000088034|pmid = 16230860|access-date = |url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/88034}}</ref> The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a [[pseudothumb]], to aid in gripping.<ref name= \"Hartstone\u2010Rose2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Hartstone\u2010Rose|first1= A.|last2= Dickinson|first2= E.|last3= Boettcher|first3=M.

These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a [[Fresnel lens]], and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as [[lesser galago]], [[bat-eared fox]], [[mouse lemur]], and others.\n\nFemales have two nipples located in the region of the groin.\n\n== Behaviour and lifestyle ==\n[[File:Ayeaye, Daubentonia madagascariensis, Joseph Wolf.jpg|thumb|220px|An aye-aye foraging, c.1863, [[Joseph Wolf]].]]\n[[File:Aye-Aye Daubentonia madagascariensis in Copenhagen (Left Hand).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Closeup of the hand showing the elongated digits and the thinner third digit.]]\nThe aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\n\n=== Diet and foraging ===\nThe aye-aye is an [[omnivore]] and commonly eats seeds, fruits, nectar and fungi, but also insect larvae and honey.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=606}}\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers.<ref name=Haring>{{cite journal|last=Haring|first=David|title=Eep!

Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} a night.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dodo: Journal of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Volume 30|last=|first=|publisher=Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust|year=1994|isbn=0-9515581-7-X|location=Jersey, Channel Islands|pages=43}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gnawed limb, Daubentonia madagascariensis.jpg|thumb|245px|right|Gnawed limb by an Aye-Aye to prey on larvae]]\nThough foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups.

It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Patterns of Range Use and Social Organization in Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) on Nosy Mangabe|last = Sterling|first = Eleanor|date = 1993|journal = Lemur Social Systems and Their Ecological Basis|pages = 1\u201310|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4899-2412-4_1|pmid = |editor-last = Kappeler|location = Plenum Press, New York|isbn = 978-1-4899-2414-8}}</ref> Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.{{r|Durrell}}\n\nLike many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find its prey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aye-Aye|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/aye-aye/?source=A-to-Z|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Aye-aye at night in the wild in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aye-ayes are nocturnal.]]\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [[rainforest]] or [[deciduous]] forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built in the forks of trees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. Nine individuals were transported to [[Nosy Mangabe]], an island near [[Maroantsetra]] off eastern Madagascar, in 1966.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=605\u2013606}} Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to [[Endangered species|Endangered]] in 2014.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=CITES>{{cite web | url = http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Daubentonia | title = Checklist of CITES Species | website = CITES | publisher = UNEP-WCMC | accessdate = 18 March 2015}}</ref> This is for three main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil, the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed, and the farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops and for poaching.

Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The [[Sakalava]] people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's [[aorta]].{{r|2007Piper}}\n\n=== Captive breeding ===\n[[File:Aye Aye.JPG|270px|thumb|upright|At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in Durham, North Carolina]]\nThe conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy. They have also revolutionized the understanding of the aye-aye diet.<ref name=Haring/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=IUCN>{{cite iucn | page = e.T6302A16114609 | title = ''Daubentonia madagascariensis'' | author = Andriaholinirina, N. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | access-date = 11 April 2020|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2012Dunkel_et_al\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Zijlstra | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Groves | first3 = C.P. | title = Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 | url = http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf | journal = Lemur News | volume = 16 | year = 2011\u20132012 | issn = 1608-1439 | pages = 64\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2007Piper\">{{cite book | last = Piper | year = 2007 | title = Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals | publisher = Greenwood Press | first = Ross|url=https://archive.org/details/extraordinaryani0000pipe| url-access = registration | quote = aye-aye. | isbn = 9780313339226 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Durrell\">{{cite web | url = http://www.durrell.org/Animals/Mammals/Ayeaye/ | title = Aye-Aye | work = [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]] | date = 2006-10-26 | accessdate = 2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\n<!--<ref name=\"2010Knowles\">[http://www.aolnews.com/science/article/superstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye/19416515?icid=main|main|dl1|link3|http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fsuperstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye%2F19416515 Harmless Creature Killed Because of Superstition], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528043039/http://www.aolnews.com/science/article/superstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye/19416515?icid=main%7Cmain%7Cdl1%7Clink3%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fsuperstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye%2F19416515 |date=2010-05-28 }} David Knowles, March 27, 2010</ref>-->\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Daubentonia madagascariensis}}\n{{Wikispecies|Daubentonia madagascariensis}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n*[http://members.tripod.com/uakari/ayeaye.html Primate Behavior: Aye-Aye]\n*ARKive \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060422080202/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Daubentonia_madagascariensis/ images and movies of the aye-aye ''(Daubentonia madagascariensis)'']\n*[http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/aye-aye Primate Info Net ''Daubentonia madagascariensis'' Factsheet]\n*[http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A00P U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile]\n\n{{Primates}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q186778}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1788]]\n[[Category:EDGE species]]\n[[Category:Lemurs]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Madagascar]]\n\n== Literature cited ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007}} -->{{cite book | last1 = Ankel-Simons | first1 = F. | title= Primate Anatomy | edition = 3rd | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 |isbn= 978-0-12-372576-9 | ref = harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beck|2009}} -->{{Cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = R.

It is currently classified as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]]; and a second species, ''[[Giant aye-aye|Daubentonia robusta]]'', appears to have become [[extinct]] at some point within the last 1000 years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus ''Daubentonia'' was named after the French naturalist [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] by his student, [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name ''Scolecophagus'' (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}  In 1863, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] coined the family name Daubentoniidae.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nThe French naturalist [[Pierre Sonnerat]] was the first to use the vernacular name \"'''aye-aye'''\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"'''long-fingered lemur'''\" by English zoologist [[George Shaw]] in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"''cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement''\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel ''et al.'' (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"''heh heh''\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"''heh heh''\" to [[avoidance speech|avoid saying the name]] of a feared, magical animal.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==\nDue to its [[Cladistics|derived]] [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [[incisor]]s (front teeth) parallels those of [[rodent]]s, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [[Rodent]]ia{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}} and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail.

However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\n\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers.<ref name=\"Perry2012\" /> The third finger, which is thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling bugs out of trees, using the hooked nail.<ref name=Science/> The middle finger is unique in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Anatomy of the hand and arm in Daubentonia madagascariensis: a functional and phylogenetic outlook|last = Soligo|first = C.|date = 2005|journal = Folia Primatol|volume = 76|issue = 5|pages = 262\u2013300|doi = 10.1159/000088034|pmid = 16230860|access-date = |url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/88034}}</ref> The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a [[pseudothumb]], to aid in gripping.<ref name= \"Hartstone\u2010Rose2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Hartstone\u2010Rose|first1= A.|last2= Dickinson|first2= E.|last3= Boettcher|first3=M.

These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a [[Fresnel lens]], and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as [[lesser galago]], [[bat-eared fox]], [[mouse lemur]], and others.\n\nFemales have two nipples located in the region of the groin.\n\n== Behaviour and lifestyle ==\n[[File:Ayeaye, Daubentonia madagascariensis, Joseph Wolf.jpg|thumb|220px|An aye-aye foraging, c.1863, [[Joseph Wolf]].]]\n[[File:Aye-Aye Daubentonia madagascariensis in Copenhagen (Left Hand).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Closeup of the hand showing the elongated digits and the thinner third digit.]]\nThe aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\n\n=== Diet and foraging ===\nThe aye-aye is an [[omnivore]] and commonly eats seeds, fruits, nectar and fungi, but also insect larvae and honey.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=606}}\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers.<ref name=Haring>{{cite journal|last=Haring|first=David|title=Eep! It's an Aye-Aye.|journal=Wildlife Conservation|date=March 1996|pages=28\u201335}}</ref> The aye-aye begins [[foraging]] between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} a night.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dodo: Journal of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Volume 30|last=|first=|publisher=Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust|year=1994|isbn=0-9515581-7-X|location=Jersey, Channel Islands|pages=43}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gnawed limb, Daubentonia madagascariensis.jpg|thumb|245px|right|Gnawed limb by an Aye-Aye to prey on larvae]]\nThough foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups.

It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Patterns of Range Use and Social Organization in Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) on Nosy Mangabe|last = Sterling|first = Eleanor|date = 1993|journal = Lemur Social Systems and Their Ecological Basis|pages = 1\u201310|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4899-2412-4_1|pmid = |editor-last = Kappeler|location = Plenum Press, New York|isbn = 978-1-4899-2414-8}}</ref> Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.{{r|Durrell}}\n\nLike many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find its prey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aye-Aye|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/aye-aye/?source=A-to-Z|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Aye-aye at night in the wild in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aye-ayes are nocturnal.]]\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [[rainforest]] or [[deciduous]] forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built in the forks of trees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. Nine individuals were transported to [[Nosy Mangabe]], an island near [[Maroantsetra]] off eastern Madagascar, in 1966.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=605\u2013606}} Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to [[Endangered species|Endangered]] in 2014.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=CITES>{{cite web | url = http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Daubentonia | title = Checklist of CITES Species | website = CITES | publisher = UNEP-WCMC | accessdate = 18 March 2015}}</ref> This is for three main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil, the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed, and the farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops and for poaching.

Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The [[Sakalava]] people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's [[aorta]].{{r|2007Piper}}\n\n=== Captive breeding ===\n[[File:Aye Aye.JPG|270px|thumb|upright|At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in Durham, North Carolina]]\nThe conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy.

[...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value.

For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \"the opposite of [[individualism]]\".<ref>Cort, John C. ''\"Christian socialism\"''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.</ref> [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\".<ref>Boyle, James. ''\"What is Socialism?\"'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists\u2014and who would be later called [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]\u2014wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.\n\nOther early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|website=www.fsmitha.com}}</ref> such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/|title=Welcome to the School of Politics &amp; International Relations|first1=Head of|last1=School|last2=admin.spirsocy@anu.edu.au|website=School of Politics & International Relations}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\">''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}</ref> Simon's ideas provided a foundation for scientific economic planning and technocratic administration of society.\n\nOther early socialist thinkers such as [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Thomas Hodgskin]] based their ideas on [[David Ricardo]]'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor&mdash;the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712235906/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=2015-07-12 }}</ref> These ideas embodied early conceptions of [[market socialism]].\n\nAfter the advent of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences between various schools ==\nAlthough they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.\n\n=== Theory ===\nSome branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. [[utopian socialism]])\u2014others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. [[Classical Marxism|early Marxism]] or [[Leninism]]). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. [[Stalinism]]), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]]), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. [[social democracy]]).\n\nSome are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[revolutionary socialism]], [[social anarchism]] and [[Trotskyism]]) whilst others tend to support [[Reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. [[Fabianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]]). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[syndicalism]] or various forms of [[Marxism]]). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2016}}\n\nSocialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. [[anarchism]] or [[left communism]]) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).\n\nAll socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. [[green left]]) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.\n\n=== Practice ===\nMost forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], [[reformism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|reformist Marxism]]) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]] can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).\n\nSome schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[anarcho-communism]], [[council communism]], left communism, Marxism or [[syndicalism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \"ownership of the [[means of production]]\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.\n\nAnother issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].\n\nDifferent ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]] and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.\n\n== Socialist planned economy ==\nThis form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the [[Communist state]]s of the 20th century.\n\n=== State-directed economy ===\nA state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[indicative planning]] or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.\n\nState-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism\u2014economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \"political administration of men, to the administration of things\".\n\nElements of state-directed socialist economies include [[dirigisme]], [[economic planning]], [[state socialism]] and [[technocracy]].\n\n=== Decentralized planned economy ===\nA decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[libertarian socialism]], [[syndicalism]] and various forms of communal utopian socialism.\n\nExamples of decentralized democratic planning include [[council communism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[industrial democracy]], [[participatory economics]], [[Soviet democracy]] and [[syndicalism]].<ref name=\"Graham-2005\"/>\n\n== Market socialism ==\n{{main|Market socialism}}\nMarket socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.\n\nSome forms of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.\n\nExamples of market socialism include [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange model]], [[liberal socialism]], [[market-oriented left-libertarianism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] the [[New Economic Mechanism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nA socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods.\n\nExamples of socialist market economies include the [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics]] and the [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\n\n== Socialist ideologies ==\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential French early socialist]]\nUtopian socialism is  a term used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html| title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \"reactionary\".<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-85345-798-5|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \"utopian\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\"/> Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies are referred to as [[primitive communism]] by Marxists.\n\nReligious sects whose members live communally, such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called \"utopian socialists\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \"utopian socialist\".\n\n=== Marxism ===\n{{main|Communism|Marxism}}\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)]]\nMarxism, or Marxist communism, refers to [[Classless society|classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]] social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. In the classic Marxist definition ([[pure communism]]), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism  (see [[post-scarcity economy]]). This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it.\n\nThe actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|commune]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \"[[reformist]]\" social democrats, were called \"communists\".  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nSome forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.\n\nIn addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[One-party state|single]] [[Communist party]] that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called Stalinism, [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].\n\nWith the Soviet Union's creation after the end of [[Russian Civil War]] that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[Communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states.\n\nCommunism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].<!--research communism in South America--> Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[one-party system]]s and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments, in [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 1980s and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states.\n\n==== Leninism and Marxism\u2013Leninism ====\n{{main|Leninism|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism\u2013Leninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\", or sometimes only \"Leninism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\n==== Stalinism ====\n{{main|Stalinism}}\nStalinism was the theory and practice of [[communism]] practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union from 1928\u20131953. Officially it adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and [[Anti-Stalinist left|criticism]]. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on [[class conflict]], utilizing [[state violence]] in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Stephen Kotkin.

Even when the [[proletariat]] has seized state power through a socialist [[revolution]], the potential remains for a [[bourgeoisie]] to restore capitalism. Indeed, Mao famously stated that \"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.\n\nUnlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.\n\nUnlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a \"[[people's war]]\" of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSince the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \"Maoist\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|CPI (Maoist)]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|CPI (ML)]] of India and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.\n\n==== Trotskyism ====\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nTrotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]\u2013[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\n\n==== Council communism and left communism ====\n{{main|Council communism|Left communism}}\nCouncil communism, or councilism, is a current of [[libertarian Marxism]] that emerged from the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[workers' councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist state|workers' democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[libertarian socialism]] movement.\n\nChief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the [[Vanguard party|party vanguardism]]<ref name=\"Pannekoek36\">[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers\u2019 Councils'']</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga \u2013 Gilles Dauv\u00e9'']</ref> and [[democratic centralism]]<ref>Pannekoek, Anton. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship] International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937.</ref> of [[Leninism|Leninist ideologies]] and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to [[social democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[parliamentarism]].<ref>Ruhle, Otto. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/ruhle02.htm \"The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair\".] 1920.</ref>\n\nThe historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before [[World War I]], but it only came into focus after 1918. All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a state capitalist system.\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of [[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|Italian autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.\n\nThrough translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].\n\nIt influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.\n\nThe Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]s.<ref name=\"iaf-ifa.org\"/><ref>\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement \u2014 at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.

Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]] to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

He thought that the \"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\", therefore \"''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\".

Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

(p. 447)</ref> In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as \"each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society\". Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: \"The new individualism is the new hellenism\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\"/>\n\n=== Social democracy ===\n{{main|Social democracy}}\nSocial democracy can be divided into classic and modern strands. Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate.\n\nThe [[Socialist International]] (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]] that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles: firstly, ''freedom''\u2014not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''\u2014not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''\u2014unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html \"Declaration of Principles\"]. Socialist International.</ref>\n\nSocial democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as [[welfare state]] policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of [[mixed economy]]. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the [[social market economy]] or [[Third Way]] mixed economies that are informed by [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n{{main|Democratic socialism}}\nModern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]] while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. <ref name=\"Day\">{{cite web|last=Day|first=Meagan|title=Why We Need Free College for Everyone \u2014 Even Rich People|work=Jacobin Magazine (July, 2019)|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/free-college-tuition-bernie-sanders-means-testing-universal-social-programs|quote=Where a meager means-tested welfare-state model breeds alienation and competition, a robust universal welfare-state model breeds trust and cooperation.

Members of several major religions have found that their beliefs about human society fit with socialist principles and ideas. As a result, religious socialist movements have developed within these religions.\n\n==== Christian socialism ====\n{{main|Christian socialism}}\n{{further|Christian left|Social Gospel}}\nThere are individuals and groups, past and present, that are clearly both Christian and socialist, such as [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], author of ''The Kingdom of Christ'' (1838), and the [[Christian Socialist Movement]] (UK) (CSM), affiliated with the British [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Distributism]], is a [[Third Way (centrism)|third-way]] economic philosophy formulated by such Catholic thinkers as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] to apply the principles of [[social justice]] articulated by the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Pope [[Leo XIII]]'s encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]''.\n\nVarious [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clerical parties have at times referred to themselves as \"Christian Social.\" Two examples are the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] of [[Karl Lueger]] in Austria before and after World War I, and the contemporary [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]]. Yet these parties have never espoused socialist policies and have always stood at the conservative side of [[Christian Democracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialdemocraticpartyofamerica.org/politicalspectrum.htm|title=Political Spectrum as seen by the Social Democratic Party of America|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of [[Venezuela]] was an advocate of a form of Christian socialism as he claims that [[Jesus Christ]] was a socialist.\n\n==== Christian anarchism ====\n{{main|Christian anarchism}}\n[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Leo Tolstoy]]]]\nChristian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines [[anarchism]] and [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |pages=2\u20134 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Locating Christian anarchism...In political theology}}</ref> The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' regarded as a key text.<ref name=CritiqueofViolence>{{cite web |first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/1338_1226.pdf |title=A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State |date=March 2010 |publisher=Political Studies Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRpM4GdE?url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/1338_1226.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |pages=19 and 208 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Leo Tolstoy}}</ref> Tolstoy sought to separate [[Russian Orthodox Christianity]]\u2014which was merged with the [[State (polity)|state]]\u2014from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the [[Sermon on the Mount]].

''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' (written by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]) consists of three parts, namely \"The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'\", \"The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'\", and \"The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory\". The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of [[liberal democracy]] and encourages the institution of a form of [[direct democracy]] based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of [[autocratic]] political repression in practice.\n\nScholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory. For example, both are against unearned income. [[Islam]] does allow private ownership of [[natural resource]]s and large industries which are owned collectively, or at least encouraged to be so.\n\n=== Regional socialism ===\n==== Arab socialism ====\n{{main|Arab socialism}}\nThe [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] rules [[Syria]] and has ruled [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] based on a tradition of [[secular]], non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine [[Arab socialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[pan-Arabism]]. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.<ref>Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91.</ref>\n\n==== Irish republican socialism ====\nSocialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] as well as the defunct [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninism]] with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.\n\n=== Eco-socialism ===\n{{main|Eco-socialism}}\nMerging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.<ref name=Babylon>Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005</ref> Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism \u2013 in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.<ref name=Kovel>Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002</ref>\n\nEco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\n[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.\n\n==== Green anarchism ====\n{{main|Green anarchism}}\nGreen anarchism, or eco-anarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"LA INSUMISI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA.

Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the [[Sorbonne]] in the early 1930s, at a time when [[centre-left]] [[Positivism]] was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of [[Christian Arabs]] among its founding members.

The party sought independence from French colonial rule in [[Vietnam]] during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQD\u0110 attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] during World War II and in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 the VNQD\u0110 and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQD\u0110, leaving his communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]] unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the [[First Indochina War]], Vietnam was [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned into two zones]].  The remnants of the VNQD\u0110 fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of anarchism]]\n* [[History of communism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Labour movement]]\n* \"[[The labor problem]]\"\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Liberal socialism]]\n* [[Libertarianism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[List of communist ideologies]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxist schools of thought]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialist state]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* G.

[...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value.

For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \"the opposite of [[individualism]]\".<ref>Cort, John C. ''\"Christian socialism\"''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.</ref> [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\".<ref>Boyle, James. ''\"What is Socialism?\"'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists\u2014and who would be later called [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]\u2014wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.\n\nOther early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|website=www.fsmitha.com}}</ref> such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/|title=Welcome to the School of Politics &amp; International Relations|first1=Head of|last1=School|last2=admin.spirsocy@anu.edu.au|website=School of Politics & International Relations}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\">''Newman, Michael''.

They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor&mdash;the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712235906/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=2015-07-12 }}</ref> These ideas embodied early conceptions of [[market socialism]].\n\nAfter the advent of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences between various schools ==\nAlthough they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.\n\n=== Theory ===\nSome branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. [[utopian socialism]])\u2014others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. [[Classical Marxism|early Marxism]] or [[Leninism]]). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. [[Stalinism]]), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]]), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. [[social democracy]]).\n\nSome are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[revolutionary socialism]], [[social anarchism]] and [[Trotskyism]]) whilst others tend to support [[Reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. [[Fabianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]]). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[syndicalism]] or various forms of [[Marxism]]). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2016}}\n\nSocialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. [[anarchism]] or [[left communism]]) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).\n\nAll socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. [[green left]]) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.\n\n=== Practice ===\nMost forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], [[reformism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|reformist Marxism]]) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]] can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).\n\nSome schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[anarcho-communism]], [[council communism]], left communism, Marxism or [[syndicalism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \"ownership of the [[means of production]]\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.\n\nAnother issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].\n\nDifferent ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]] and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.\n\n== Socialist planned economy ==\nThis form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the [[Communist state]]s of the 20th century.\n\n=== State-directed economy ===\nA state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[indicative planning]] or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.\n\nState-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism\u2014economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \"political administration of men, to the administration of things\".\n\nElements of state-directed socialist economies include [[dirigisme]], [[economic planning]], [[state socialism]] and [[technocracy]].\n\n=== Decentralized planned economy ===\nA decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[libertarian socialism]], [[syndicalism]] and various forms of communal utopian socialism.\n\nExamples of decentralized democratic planning include [[council communism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[industrial democracy]], [[participatory economics]], [[Soviet democracy]] and [[syndicalism]].<ref name=\"Graham-2005\"/>\n\n== Market socialism ==\n{{main|Market socialism}}\nMarket socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.\n\nSome forms of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.\n\nExamples of market socialism include [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange model]], [[liberal socialism]], [[market-oriented left-libertarianism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] the [[New Economic Mechanism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nA socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods.\n\nExamples of socialist market economies include the [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics]] and the [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\n\n== Socialist ideologies ==\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential French early socialist]]\nUtopian socialism is  a term used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html| title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \"reactionary\".<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-85345-798-5|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \"utopian\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\"/> Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies are referred to as [[primitive communism]] by Marxists.\n\nReligious sects whose members live communally, such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called \"utopian socialists\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \"utopian socialist\".\n\n=== Marxism ===\n{{main|Communism|Marxism}}\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)]]\nMarxism, or Marxist communism, refers to [[Classless society|classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]] social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. In the classic Marxist definition ([[pure communism]]), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism  (see [[post-scarcity economy]]). This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it.\n\nThe actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|commune]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \"[[reformist]]\" social democrats, were called \"communists\".  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nSome forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.\n\nIn addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[One-party state|single]] [[Communist party]] that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called Stalinism, [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].\n\nWith the Soviet Union's creation after the end of [[Russian Civil War]] that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[Communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states.\n\nCommunism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].<!--research communism in South America--> Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[one-party system]]s and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments, in [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 1980s and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states.\n\n==== Leninism and Marxism\u2013Leninism ====\n{{main|Leninism|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism\u2013Leninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\", or sometimes only \"Leninism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\n==== Stalinism ====\n{{main|Stalinism}}\nStalinism was the theory and practice of [[communism]] practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union from 1928\u20131953. Officially it adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and [[Anti-Stalinist left|criticism]]. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on [[class conflict]], utilizing [[state violence]] in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Stephen Kotkin.

Indeed, Mao famously stated that \"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.\n\nUnlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.\n\nUnlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a \"[[people's war]]\" of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSince the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \"Maoist\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|CPI (Maoist)]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|CPI (ML)]] of India and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.\n\n==== Trotskyism ====\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nTrotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]\u2013[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\n\n==== Council communism and left communism ====\n{{main|Council communism|Left communism}}\nCouncil communism, or councilism, is a current of [[libertarian Marxism]] that emerged from the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[workers' councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist state|workers' democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[libertarian socialism]] movement.\n\nChief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the [[Vanguard party|party vanguardism]]<ref name=\"Pannekoek36\">[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers\u2019 Councils'']</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga \u2013 Gilles Dauv\u00e9'']</ref> and [[democratic centralism]]<ref>Pannekoek, Anton. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship] International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937.</ref> of [[Leninism|Leninist ideologies]] and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to [[social democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[parliamentarism]].<ref>Ruhle, Otto. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/ruhle02.htm \"The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair\".] 1920.</ref>\n\nThe historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before [[World War I]], but it only came into focus after 1918. All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a state capitalist system.\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of [[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|Italian autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.\n\nThrough translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].\n\nIt influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.\n\nThe Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]s.<ref name=\"iaf-ifa.org\"/><ref>\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement \u2014 at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.

Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]] to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n==== Individualist anarchism ====\n{{main|Individualist anarchism}}\nIndividualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.<ref name=\"ryner\">\"What do I mean by individualism?

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

He thought that the \"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\", therefore \"''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\".

And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists.

Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

(p. 447)</ref> In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as \"each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society\". Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: \"The new individualism is the new hellenism\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\"/>\n\n=== Social democracy ===\n{{main|Social democracy}}\nSocial democracy can be divided into classic and modern strands. Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate.\n\nThe [[Socialist International]] (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]] that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles: firstly, ''freedom''\u2014not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''\u2014not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''\u2014unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html \"Declaration of Principles\"]. Socialist International.</ref>\n\nSocial democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as [[welfare state]] policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of [[mixed economy]]. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the [[social market economy]] or [[Third Way]] mixed economies that are informed by [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n{{main|Democratic socialism}}\nModern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]] while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. <ref name=\"Day\">{{cite web|last=Day|first=Meagan|title=Why We Need Free College for Everyone \u2014 Even Rich People|work=Jacobin Magazine (July, 2019)|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/free-college-tuition-bernie-sanders-means-testing-universal-social-programs|quote=Where a meager means-tested welfare-state model breeds alienation and competition, a robust universal welfare-state model breeds trust and cooperation. These qualities are necessary to develop a foundation from which to launch other ambitious social projects, and to progress as a society.}}</ref> Democratic socialists are also committed to the ideas of the [[Property redistribution|redistribution]] of wealth and power, as well as social ownership of major industries, concepts widely abandoned by social democrats.\n\nThere are no countries in the world that would qualify as a democratic socialist state, although some states describe themselves as such, for example [[Venezuela]], whose former leader [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] claimed that democratic socialism was integral to the [[Bolivarian]] form of socialism that he was trying to promote.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sojo|first=Cleto A|title=Venezuela's Chavez Closes World Social Forum with Call to Transcend Capitalism|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/907|publisher=Venezuela analysis}}</ref>\n\n=== Liberal socialism ===\n{{main|Liberal socialism}}\nLiberal socialism is a type of [[socialism]] that includes [[Liberalism|liberal]] principles within it.<ref name=\"Gerald F.

''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' (written by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]) consists of three parts, namely \"The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'\", \"The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'\", and \"The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory\". The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of [[liberal democracy]] and encourages the institution of a form of [[direct democracy]] based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of [[autocratic]] political repression in practice.\n\nScholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory. For example, both are against unearned income. [[Islam]] does allow private ownership of [[natural resource]]s and large industries which are owned collectively, or at least encouraged to be so.\n\n=== Regional socialism ===\n==== Arab socialism ====\n{{main|Arab socialism}}\nThe [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] rules [[Syria]] and has ruled [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] based on a tradition of [[secular]], non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine [[Arab socialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[pan-Arabism]]. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.<ref>Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91.</ref>\n\n==== Irish republican socialism ====\nSocialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] as well as the defunct [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninism]] with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.\n\n=== Eco-socialism ===\n{{main|Eco-socialism}}\nMerging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.<ref name=Babylon>Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005</ref> Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism \u2013 in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.<ref name=Kovel>Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002</ref>\n\nEco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\n[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.\n\n==== Green anarchism ====\n{{main|Green anarchism}}\nGreen anarchism, or eco-anarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"LA INSUMISI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA.

The party's motto, \"Unity, Liberty, Socialism\" (''wahda, hurriya, ishtirakiya''), was inspired by the French [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] political doctrine linking national unity and social equity.<ref name='Histoire  de Saint-Just D\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Convention Nationale'>{{cite news |first=Ernest |last=Hamel |title=Histoire de Saint-Just D\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Convention Nationale |year=1859 |publisher=Impr. et Librairie Poulet-Malassis et Broise}}</ref> In the slogan, \"unity\" refers to Arab unity, \"liberty\" emphasizes being free from foreign control and interference, and \"socialism\" refers to [[Arab socialism]], not European-style [[Marxism]] or [[communism]].\n\nThe party was founded in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] in 1940 by the Syrian intellectuals [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Bitar]], and since its inception, it has established branches in different Arab countries, although the only countries it has ever held power in are Syria and [[Iraq]]. Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the [[Sorbonne]] in the early 1930s, at a time when [[centre-left]] [[Positivism]] was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of [[Christian Arabs]] among its founding members. For them, a resolutely nationalist and secular political framework was a suitable way to avoid a faith-based Islamic orientation and to give non-Muslims full acknowledgement as citizens.\n\nIn 1955, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the military against the historical leadership of Aflaq and al-Bitar led the Syrian and Iraqi parties to split into rival organizations\u2014the Qotri (Regionalist) Syria-based party and the Qawmi (Nationalist) Iraq-based party.<ref name='The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics'>{{cite news |first=Nikolaos |last=van Dam |title=The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics |year=1979 |publisher=I B Tauris}}</ref>  Both Ba'ath parties kept their names and maintained parallel structures, but became so antagonistic that the Syrian Ba'ath government became the only Arab government to support non-Arab [[Iran]] against Iraq during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].\n\nIn Syria, the Ba'ath Party has had a [[monopoly]] on political power since the party's 1963 coup. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq in 1963, but were deposed months later. They  returned to power in a 1968 coup and remained the sole party of government until the [[2003 Iraq invasion]].

The remnants of the VNQD\u0110 fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of anarchism]]\n* [[History of communism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Labour movement]]\n* \"[[The labor problem]]\"\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Liberal socialism]]\n* [[Libertarianism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[List of communist ideologies]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxist schools of thought]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialist state]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* G.

Though it no longer has a key role in transportation, Piaggio Ape is still used as a minitaxi in some areas such as the islands of [[Ischia]] and [[Stromboli]] (on Stromboli no cars are allowed). It has recently been re-launched as a trendy-ecological means of transportation, or, relying on the role the Ape played in the history of Italian design, as a promotional tool.

Initially, auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi had to wait in long queues for CNG refueling, but the situation improved following an increase in the number of CNG stations. Gradually, many state governments passed similar laws, thus shifting to CNG or LPG vehicles in most large cities to improve air quality and reduce pollution. Certain local governments are pushing for [[four-stroke engine]]s instead of two-stroke ones. Typical [[fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]] for an Indian-made auto rickshaw is around {{convert|35|km/l}} of [[petrol]].

Some enterprising drivers purchased these bikes, added on a gear box (probably from a [[Willys]] [[jeep]]), welded on a passenger compartment that was good for four to six passengers, and put the highly unusual and unconventional vehicles onto the roads.

NJG 1 was formed on 22 June 1940 in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\nBy the end of the war it was the most successful night fighter unit and had claimed some 2,311 victories by day and night, for some 676 aircrew killed in action.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}}\n\n== Background==\n[[Night fighter]] operations did not feature in [[Wehrmacht]] [[war games]] during 1935 and 1936. Little of the Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 concerned night fighting save for Section 253, which called for night fighting zones to be established, so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each other. [[Search light]]s were to be utilised in support of the pilots. Section 253 concluded that any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] ordered experimenting with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10-16}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15-16}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} Kammhuber established the [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI ''Gruppe'' was formed on 22 June 1940 from elements of I./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1]] (ZG 1) and IV./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26]] (ZG 26).  II ''Gruppe'' was formed from IV./(N)[[JG 2]] on 1 July 1940, although the ''Gruppe'' was redesignated III./NJG 1. The second formaction occurred the same date, 1 July, from renaming Z./[[Kampfgeschwader 30]] (''Zerst\u00f6rer''/KG 30). On 7 September 1940 this ''Gruppe'' were redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG 2), though it received personnel from I/Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26. III ''Gruppe'' was raised on 1 July also, from II/NJG 1. IV./NJG 1 was raised on 1 October 1942 from elements of II./NJG 2.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] became the first [[Geschwaderkommodore]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} [[Hauptmann]] [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], took command of I./NJG 1, [[Major]] [[Walter Ehle]], became the first permanent commander of II/NJG 1,  Hauptmann von Bothmer and Major [[Helmut Lent]] took command of III and IV./NJG 1 respectively.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nI/NJG 1 set up base at [[Venlo Airfield]], where to remained from 18 March 1941 to 5 September 1944. 18,000 workers worked on the site which measured 1,180 [[hectares]]. The two take-off runways were 1,450 mtres (4,760 ft) long, and a third 1,200 metres (3,940 feet) in length. 2,000 lamps were used for lighting and 48 km (29.8 miles) of roads led to workshops, command posts, and accommodation.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=29}} The formation of the night fighter wings brought together different kinds of pilots with different preferences. The crews of II/NJG 1, which were formed from Z/KG 30, preferred the [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Dornier Do 217]], which were regarded by Bf 110 pilots as \"lame ducks\" unsuitable for the role. These pilots preferred other qualities not prevalent in Zerstorer aircraft; spacious cockpits, a third man to act as lookout, longer endurance, auto-pilot, and more powerful armament. These pilots, in some cases, were advanced in years for a military aviator, often they were former [[Lufthansa]] pilots. These men did not adapt easily to the concept of controlled night fighting.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}} [[Werner Baake]] and [[Rudolf Schoenert]] were an examples of the ex-Lufhansa pilots that joined the Luftwaffe in 1941.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=125}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn the autumn, 1940 the Luftwaffe began long-range intruder operations (''Fernnachtjagd'') to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} The Luftwaffe signalling service were able to determine when Bomber Command operations were going to begin. Night fighters were ordered to patrol the German coast, fly to known Bomber Command bases and follow the bombers back to [[England]] along known routes.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} I/[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] became the sole intruder unit for this type of operation, but the results were expensive. The wing lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF claimed shot down.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} Over Europe, the German defences were limited in 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precisie but short-ranged [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvanage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], and could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32-33}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf 110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over 5,000 m (16,400 ft). German pilots would have to detect the bomber early in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} The introduction of newer radar variants, such as the [[Freya radar]], eventually improved the range and identification problems prevelant in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=33\u201354}}\n\nIn mid-1940, the Stab/NJG 1 was based at D\u00fcsseldorf and [[Deelen]] under Falck and equipped with three Bf 110Bs. At B\u00f6nninghardt, I/NJG 1 mustered 34 Bf 110Cs and Ds with 22 operational. At D\u00fcsseldorf, II/NJG 1 could field 11 Ju 88Cs, four operational, and 10 Do 17Zs, nine operational. At [[Cologne]], III/NJG 1 still operated the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]; 13 Bf 109Cs, four operational, three Bf 109Ds and one combat ready, 17 Bf 109Es were present with all but one operational.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=295}} On the night of 19/20 July, [[Werner Streib]], 2/NJG 1, claimed one of the first aerial victories for NJG 1; a [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] shot down at 02:15 near [[Saerbeck]]. Streib would become ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' II/NJG 1 only two months later.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=10}} Only 42 British bombers were claimed shot down in 1940 by German night fighters.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}} Streib claimed 22 aerial victories in 1941, making him the most successful night fighter pilot of the year. [[Paul Gildner]] claimed 21, and Lent claimed 20, making him the third highest claimant in the Luftwaffe that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], who spent several days commanding I/NJG 1 in 1940 during its formation, claimed 13.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226, 240}} At the end of 1941 [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]] joined the wing. Schnaufer would become the most successful night fighter pilot in history, with 121 claims.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=3\u20134}} \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-659-6436-12, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bf 110G night fighter with radar. The 110 was the mainstay of NJG 1]]\nIn mid-1941 NJG 1 began experimenting with [[Lichtenstein radar]], which had become operational.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] shot down six RAF bombers while flying a radar-installed [[Dornier Do 215]]B-5 between 10 August and 30 September 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} The only Lichtenstein radar in service then became unserviceable for the next successes were not recorded until June 1942.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Becker developed his own tactics for attacking a bomber. He stalked the aircraft from the stern, just below the height shown on the radar. After sighting the bomber, he dived and accelerated to avoid being spotted by the tail gunner. Once underneath the enemy, Becker reduced the throttle and matched the speed of the unsuspecting pilot. Becker then climbed steadily to 50 metres (164 metres) from below the target before he pulled up and opened fire. Because the Do 215 lost speed the bomber flew ahead and the through the stream of shells. With this method, the gun sight was rarely needed. These tactics were adopted by the night fighter force.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} The first Ju 88C fighters, equipped with radar were delivered to II./NJG 1 at [[Leeuwarden]] in February 1942. Only four sets arived and it took several weeks for them to become operational. The crews soon came to appreciate the device and were eager to secure it for their aircraft.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Other platforms were tested in NJG 1 at this time. In March 1942 the [[Dornier Do 217]] J was also trialed in service with NJG 1; however the lack of performance made the type unpopular with crews.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=45\u201346}} \n\nIn February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command. Harris became the driving force behind producing a powerful [[heavy bomber]] command to carry out his [[area bombing]] operations. The attacks on [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|L\u00fcbeck in March]] and [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne in May]] 1942 began the new phase in the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} Over Lubeck, NJG 1 claimed only one bomber from seven claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} NJG 1 claimed 21 bombers during the latter attack on Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 from the 32 claimed by German night fighter units.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} 41 bombers were lost.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=127}} Bomber Command began routine 1,000-bomber raids over Germany from 30 May to 17 August 1942 using the [[bomber stream]] to swap Kammhuber's defences. From August 1942, Bomber Command began introducing new navigation aids for its air fleets.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|pp=123\u2013178}} On 31 December 1942, Bomber Command utilised [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]] [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and Lancasters equipped with [[Oboe (navigation)|OBOE]] on a test raid to Dusseldorf.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=115}} Knacke made the last NJG 1 claim of the year against the latter type.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=63}} 1942 proved to be successful in a tactical sense for German night fighters. Lent led the claims for the year with 42, [[Reinhold Knacke]] claimed 40, as did Becker while Gildner claimed 38.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} On the night of the 16/17 September 1942 Knacke became the first night fighter to claim [[ace in a day]] status when he claimed five bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=241}} In February 1943, one of the first major \"experts\", Becker was killed in action on a rare daylight interception against the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) [[Eighth Air Force]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=77}} Becker followed [[Helmut Woltersdorf]], killed in action in June 1942.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|1999|p=xi}}\n\n===Battle of the Ruhr,  Hamburg and Peenem\u00fcnde===\nIn March 1943, Harris began his first concerted [[military campaign]] against a specific objective, known as the [[Battle of the Ruhr]]. Harris had 53 squadrons for the battle, and his pathfinders were now operating the [[H2S (radar)|H2S ground-mapping radar]]. The Air Marshal felt he had sufficient resources for a long offensive against the German industrial region.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}} On 5 March 1943, Falck commanded the command ''staffel'' from Deelen, Streib commanded I ''Gruppe'' from Venlo, Thimmig commanded III ''Gruppe'' from [[Leeuwarden]] ,and Lent IV ''Gruppe'' from [[Twente]]; all operated the Bf 110.

Among the claimants were fighter pilots [[Manfred Meurer]], [[Herbert L\u00fctje]], [[Heinz Vinke]] and Lent all claimed. On 12/13 March NJG 1 claimed 13, and repeated this again on 29/30 March. On 3/4 April the wing claimed 17. The success was not repeated until 27/28 April when its pilots submitted 10 claims.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=70-73, 76-77}} On 4/5 May NJG 1 claimed 24 bombers destroyed and was the only Luftwaffe unit to report any successes that night. Among the pilots was [[Hans-Dieter Frank]] who would claim 55 aerial victories and briefly command I/NJG 1 before his death in a collision with a colleague while flying a [[Heinkel He 219]]. The collision may have been caused by an attack on his fighter by [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Bob Braham]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=76-77}} On 12/13 May the wing claimed 25, and on 13/14 May the pilots claimed another 26.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=79-80}} On 23/24 May a further 23 were claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The attacks on Dortmund that night cost Bomber Command 38 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}} Over the next six days 58 bombers were claimed by the night of the 30/31 May.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The operation against [[Wuppertal]] on 29/30 May cost the British 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}}  211 RAF bombers were claimed by NJG 1 in June 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=84-91}} Total British losses were 277 for the month to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} During the campaign NJG 1 was able to engage Bomber Command consistently. On one night the wing scrambled 50 night fighters, only one-sixth of the Luftwaffe force. Committal of further crews was not possible in Kammhuber's system which required rigid allocation of units to specific points on the line.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=46}} The Nazi [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], wrote in his diary on 14 May 1943 of German defences; \"during the night there was another exceptionally heavy raid on [[Duisburg]]....An unspeakable sorrow and great distress has come to the sorely tired city. Our technical development as regards [[submarine]] missions and air warfare is far inferior to that of the [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]]s. During the past five months the enemy has had the upper hand, almost everywhere he is defeating us in the air.\"{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=67}} \n\nBy the time the Ruhr campaign ended Bomber Command had suffered heavy losses to German night fighters and anti-aircraft defences. 1,099 were lost to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} The Luftwaffe's defences were unable to prevent Bomber Command from severely disrupting German production. Steel production fell by 200,000 tons and the armaments industry was facing a steel shortfall of 400,000 tons.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} After doubling production in 1942, production of steel increased only by 20 percent in 1943. [[Adolf Hitler]] and his armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] were forced to cut planned increases in production. This disruption caused the ''zulieferungskrise'' (sub-components crisis). The increase of aircraft production for the Luftwaffe also came to an abrupt halt. Monthly production failed to increase between July 1943 and March 1944. [[Adam Tooze]] concludes; \"Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armaments miracle in its tracks.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} Production of [[locomotive]]s halted after March 1943 in the Ruhr along with ammunition fuses.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=134\u2013135}} Over 100,000 people were [[dehoused]] in [[Essen]], contributing to the inability to continue production at the [[Krupp]] plant.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=135}}\n\nLuftwaffe night pilots experienced the presence of long-range RAF night fighting aircraft for the first time over Germany. Radar-installed [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s provided indirect [[fighter escort]] to Bomber Command over the Ruhr. These crews came from [[Fighter Command]], and termed their operations as \"flower\" [[sortie]]s. These tactics required RAF pilots to fly to known German night fighter airfields and patrol them in an effort to destroy the Luftwaffe interceptors as they got airborne or landed. These operations were successful and accounted for German aircraft losses in June.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=90-94}} On 14 and 25 June 1943, NJG 1 lost one and two Bf 110s to RAF night fighters.{{sfn|Balss|1997|pp=157\u2013158}} In August 1943, Bomber Command's [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] against [[Peenem\u00fcnde]]. Wing Commander Braham engaged two NJG 1 crews, the 15-victory ace Georg Kraft and another fighter ace [[Heinz Vinke]] and shot them both down, killing the former and wounding the latter.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=142}} Two other crews were lost on the operation.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|p=98}} A development of the raid was the recorded entry into II/NJG 1 war diary that it was to be converted to \"[[Wilde Sau|Wild Boar]]\" operations\u2014the use of radar-less [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] single-engine fighters piloted by experienced night flyers to attack bombers.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|pp=88-89}} [[Chief of the General Staff]], [[Hans Jeschonnek]] purportedly committed suicide because of the failure of night defences to repulse or prevent the attack.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|p=195}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-004-32, Heinkel He 219 als Nachtj\u00e4ger.jpg|thumb|right|He 219 night fighter.

The objective was to disrupt or end [[U-boat]] production in the port city. The introduction of \"[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]\" blew a hole in German radar coverage and the [[bomber stream]]s, aided by OBOE and H2S radar were able to penetrate the defences to devastate the centre of the city. The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) system of radar-controlled night fighters slipping into the bomber stream and then using its own radar to pick out and engage individual bombers had gone. The effects of the raid, and the realisation German radar was temporarily blinded, led to the widespread use of the Wild Boar tactics over the summer, 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=95}} 791 bombers hit the city. German air defences accounted for only 1.5 percent of the attacking force. The Nazi leadership was shaken, and Kammhuber, who resisted calls to abandon the advanced ''Himmelbett'' system, was compelled to find technical solutions to the jamming of Freya, Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrzburg radars. Kammhuber regarded the Wild Boar solution as an emergency measure only.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=94-96}} NJG 1 claimed only three from a total of 12 claimed by night fighter pilots in defence of the city\u2014[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] claimed the rest. [[August Geiger (pilot)|August Geiger]] claimed two [Geiger became another notable victim of Braham in September 1943].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=95-97}}\n\nIn August the \"[[Zahme Sau|tame boar]]\" tactics were used to some effect. [[Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg]]'s idea was for night fighters equipped with experimental SN-2 radar to cooperate with Y-control systems and \"sluice\" them into the bomber stream. Once there, the night fighters were ordered to transmit direction-finding signals to attract other night fighters. While unguided, the radar operators and night fighter command retained some control over operations with success in August amounting to 250 aircraft claimed shot down on all fronts. The success was offset by losses of 40 killed in the night fighter arm, with only 28 replacements in August. 61 twin-engine night fighters were lost, but only 59 were replaced.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=101\u2013104, 106}} As one German historian noted, the advent of the frequent Mosquito intruder operations from October \"no airfield in Central Germany was safe.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=143}} NJG 1 were engaged in daylight operations against the [[United States Army Air Force]] in August. Elements of the wing engaged the [[Eighth Air Force]] during the [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission]] with some success.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=145}}\n\nOn 5 October 1943 NJG 1 with NJG 2 formed the [[1st Fighter Division (Germany)|1. Jadgdivision]], covering the Netherlands, Belgium and the Ruhr.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=104\u2013105}} [[Operation Corona]] and \"[[Mandrel (electronics)|Mandrel]]\" further confused night fighters as was evident in the October [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|attack on Kassel]]; in which everything when wrong for the defences.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=108-109, 146-147}} A [[Naxos radar detector]]-equipped night fighter recognised the change in course and was able to bring 180 night fighters to Kassel where they destroyed 39 bombers for the loss of six.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=147}} NJG 1 could claim only four. Meurer, Schnaufer and [[Werner Husemann]] were among the claimants.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\n===Battle of Berlin and Normandy===\nIn November 1943 Arthur Harris began the \"[[Battle of Berlin (RAF campaign)|Battle of Berlin]]\" in the belief the destruction of the German capital would end the war without [[Operation Overlord]], the planned amphibious invasion of France.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=105}} The battle would end in March 1944, in a defensive victory for the German night fighter force.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|1961|pp=193\u2013194}} By 12 December 1943, the [[Heinkel He 219]] night fighter had been added to NJG 1's order of battle and I ''Gruppe'' were equipped with it. By June 1944, I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He 219s, which proved expensive in time and effort; some 90,000 man-hours per aircraft in comparison to 30,000 on the Ju 88C and G. A handful were delivered to II/NJG 1.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=136, 245}} At the start of the battle, NJG 1 was mostly still a Bf 110 unit. Streib commanded Stab/NJG 1 and the wing from Deelen. Meurer commanded I/NJG 1 at Venlo which operated the Bf 110 and He 219. II ''Gruppe'' under von Bonnin at Sint Truiden operated the Bf 110 and the Do 217 while [[Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld]] and [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]] commanded III and IV ''Gruppe'' at Twente and Leeuwarden; both operated the Bf 110.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=127}} \n\nA notable development at this time was in the configuration of German night fighter armament. The [[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]], pioneered in NJG 2, was now in use in NJG 1 during 1943 and 1944. Schnaufer, the leading night fighter in history, estimated he claimed 20 to 30 bombers using the upward firing cannon(s).{{sfn|Price|1973|p=203}} According to Schnaufer, many of the less experienced crew preferred the weapon system to the conventional front-pointing guns.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=203}} 1943 ended with pilots from NJG 1 leading the claim charts. Lent was acknowledged to have 76 and led the Luftwaffe in this field. Streib's total stood at 63, Meurer 62 at his death, Schoenert 56, the deceased Frank, 55, the late Gieger 53, Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld 51, Becker, Gildner and Knacker\u2014all of whom had 44\u2014were killed in the year. Schnaufer and Vinke had claimed 42 and 37 respectively. [[Walter Ehle]], killed on 18 November became the earliest casualty of the battle.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} At this time, German fighter fighters had abandoned the old wild boar operations along with the rigid beacon-based ''Himmelbett'' system for a simple practice of using their own radar to detect bombers once ground controllers led them to the bomber stream. When there, pilots were expected to fight until fuel or ammunition was expended. The tame boar method predominated in what was to become a successful period for the night fighter force.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=127}} \n\n\nIn the midst of the battle, I/NJG 1 lost group commander Meurer\u2014with 65 claims\u2014the third highest scoring night fighter of the war at the time in January 1944. He utilised the Schr\u00e4ge Musik weapon too close to a British bomber which exploded and took Meurer with it.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=110}} In March 1944 another fighter leader, Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld was killed on day 12.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=236}} During the following weeks Bomber Command selected southwest Germany as its main area of operations, allowing for their return over neutral [[Switzerland]]. The Luftwaffe responded by transferring II and III/NJG 1 to France. III/NJG 1 operated from [[Laon]] from 20 April. Night fighter operations over France proved costly for the Luftwaffe. Bomber Command flew on moonlit nights and were provided with strong Mosquito fighter support. Luftwaffe pilots hardly managed to engage the bomber streams.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=155, 159}}\n\nOn 23/24 March 1944, Harris authorised a sixteenth, and final attack upon Berlin nearly five weeks after the last; having postponed it from 21 March. 811 bombers set out, with 147 providing diversion raids to [[Le Havre]] in France. [[No. 105 Squadron RAF]] sent 12 Mosquitos to Twente, Venlo and Sint Truinden; all home to NJG 1 units. A further 17 Mosquitos were sent on pathfinder operations.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|pp=185-186}} NJG 2 and 3 were to plan their interceptions along the transit routes near [[Sylt]]. [[NJG 5]], and [[NJG 6]] were held for operations near the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] coast and Berlin and target area. [[NJG 4]] and 1 were apparently reserved for action against the returning bombers. The diversions had little effect. NJG 1, 2 and 3 operated along the bomber stream route all night.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|p=197}} Of the 72 aircraft Bomber Command reported lost, 45 were against predictive anti-aircraft fire, 18 to night fighters and nine to unknown causes.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|p=207}} The Battle of Berlin cost Bomber Command 497 aircraft with a further 72 crashing in England.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|p=223}}\n\nThe decline of the Luftwaffe night fighter force began only three months after arguably its greatest success. Aerial resistance decline by day and night and a state of [[air supremacy]] was achieved by Allied air forces. The Luftwaffe's shortage of fuel to operate and provide sufficient training for fighter crews became apparent.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=166-167}} The OKL had not foreseen the collapse of its day and night fighter force and had assumed that Bomber Command would not resume deep-penetration raids for some time. Incredibly, the high command thought the Luftwaffe could prevent a landing in Western Europe. By June 1944, most night fighter units had been moved to the periphery of [[Luftflotte Reich]]'s territory in [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and Western Europe. Only NJG 1 and 3 remained in Germany.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=168}} In July, the [[Normandy Campaign]] nearing its nadir, NJG 1 were moved to airfields spread over [[Westphalia]]. The collapse of the German front in Normandy in August necessitated NJG 1s evacuation of all ''staffel'' from the [[Low Countries]] in September 1944 to [[Munster]], [[Dortmund]], [[Dusseldorf]] ]and [[Fritzlar]]. The [[Wehrmacht]]'s hold on the eastern Netherlands allowed for the return of elements of NJG 1 for operations in Twente in November 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=170-171}} Stab/NJG 1 relocated to [[Paderborn]], I/NJG 1 to Munster, II/NJG 1 to Dusseldorf, III/NJG 1 to Fritzlar and IV/NJG 1 to Dortmund. 2/NJG 1 was detached and operated from Niedermendig. All ''gruppen'' were subordinated to the 3. Jagddivision.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=172-173}}\n\nThe OKL correctly surmised that high-frequency technology rather than the number and quality of night fighters would decide the next phase of the battle. They drew the wrong conclusions from their successes in early 1944 and wrongly assumed the straight forward devices such as Naxos, SN-2 and [[Flensburg radar detector]]s coupled with a high level of training would inflict severe damage on the enemy provided their secrets could be kept from the enemy and enough of them made available. Production was concentrated on SN-2, while centimetric radar came low on the list of priorities. The radar types in use, used long-wave radar waves which were prone to jamming and created high drag. The decision not to fit SN-2 to He 219s caused high losses of the type. Only Ju 88 units received Naxos. In December 1944, a final concerted effort to regain the high-frequency lead was made in the SN-3 radar.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=176-178}}\n\nIn equipment the German night fighter force remained capable. The Bf 110 may have been considered obsolete, but in the hands of experienced pilots it remained a formidable night fighter. The victory claims submitted by I/NJG 1 (He 219) and II/NJG 1 (Bf 110) have been analysed from June 1944 onward. Operating under the same conditions II/NJG 1 regularly shot down more bombers and the He 219-group. Nevertheles, Bf 110G production was tapering off as Ju 88G production increased to 339 in December 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=185}} The technicians at [[Heinkel]] cooperated closely with operational units to produce modifications at request, but these were contradictory. In II/NJG 1 pilots argued for a cannon of 30 mm calibre, only later to show a preference for 20 mms [owing to the low-muzzle velocity it required firing from short-range increasing the danger to the German crew]. When the crews complained about the two-man He 219, the manufacturer made modifications for a third member, only for the proposal to be dropped for a complete redesign with this in mind. When it was realised the He 219s performance over the RAF Mosquito proved insufficient the new [[Heinkel He 419]] \"Mosquito hunter\" was planned, but too late for production. I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He 219A-0, A-2 and A-5s. The A-0 were brought up to latter standards.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=188-190}} II/NJG 1 operated small numbers of He 219s, but most were not comfortable with the type and they found the performance was not significantly better than the Bf 110. The crews did not like being perched ahead of the engines and reiterated the drawback of the missing third member or \"lookout.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=190}} \n\nFrom July 1944 to May 1945, Bomber Command made 10 large raids per month. From October 1944 60-80 Mosquitos flew into Germany on an average of ten nights per month. The He 219 pilots in NJG 1 could do little to oppose them. In July 1944 He 219s claimed three of them; but only one near the British aircraft's operating height of 9,000 m (29, 530 ft). Soon, the task of opposing the Mosquito intruders fell to single-engine units. Confounding operational issues further, distrust permeated between crews and ground controllers for jamming and the use of decoy aircraft made interceptions difficult. Pilots had no choice but to follow their directions because the only long-range radars, Naxos and Flensburg, became useless by July 1944, and SN-2 was beginning to show signs it had been compromised. The British tactics of flying below 3,000 m (9, 840 ft) caused so many contacts on the SN-2 screens it was difficult to identify and follow a specific target.

NJG 1 was formed on 22 June 1940 in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\nBy the end of the war it was the most successful night fighter unit and had claimed some 2,311 victories by day and night, for some 676 aircrew killed in action.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}}\n\n== Background==\n[[Night fighter]] operations did not feature in [[Wehrmacht]] [[war games]] during 1935 and 1936. Little of the Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 concerned night fighting save for Section 253, which called for night fighting zones to be established, so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each other. [[Search light]]s were to be utilised in support of the pilots. Section 253 concluded that any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] ordered experimenting with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10-16}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15-16}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} Kammhuber established the [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI ''Gruppe'' was formed on 22 June 1940 from elements of I./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1]] (ZG 1) and IV./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26]] (ZG 26).  II ''Gruppe'' was formed from IV./(N)[[JG 2]] on 1 July 1940, although the ''Gruppe'' was redesignated III./NJG 1. The second formaction occurred the same date, 1 July, from renaming Z./[[Kampfgeschwader 30]] (''Zerst\u00f6rer''/KG 30). On 7 September 1940 this ''Gruppe'' were redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG 2), though it received personnel from I/Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26. III ''Gruppe'' was raised on 1 July also, from II/NJG 1. IV./NJG 1 was raised on 1 October 1942 from elements of II./NJG 2.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] became the first [[Geschwaderkommodore]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} [[Hauptmann]] [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], took command of I./NJG 1, [[Major]] [[Walter Ehle]], became the first permanent commander of II/NJG 1,  Hauptmann von Bothmer and Major [[Helmut Lent]] took command of III and IV./NJG 1 respectively.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nI/NJG 1 set up base at [[Venlo Airfield]], where to remained from 18 March 1941 to 5 September 1944. 18,000 workers worked on the site which measured 1,180 [[hectares]]. The two take-off runways were 1,450 mtres (4,760 ft) long, and a third 1,200 metres (3,940 feet) in length. 2,000 lamps were used for lighting and 48 km (29.8 miles) of roads led to workshops, command posts, and accommodation.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=29}} The formation of the night fighter wings brought together different kinds of pilots with different preferences. The crews of II/NJG 1, which were formed from Z/KG 30, preferred the [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Dornier Do 217]], which were regarded by Bf 110 pilots as \"lame ducks\" unsuitable for the role. These pilots preferred other qualities not prevalent in Zerstorer aircraft; spacious cockpits, a third man to act as lookout, longer endurance, auto-pilot, and more powerful armament. These pilots, in some cases, were advanced in years for a military aviator, often they were former [[Lufthansa]] pilots. These men did not adapt easily to the concept of controlled night fighting.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}} [[Werner Baake]] and [[Rudolf Schoenert]] were an examples of the ex-Lufhansa pilots that joined the Luftwaffe in 1941.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=125}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn the autumn, 1940 the Luftwaffe began long-range intruder operations (''Fernnachtjagd'') to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} The Luftwaffe signalling service were able to determine when Bomber Command operations were going to begin. Night fighters were ordered to patrol the German coast, fly to known Bomber Command bases and follow the bombers back to [[England]] along known routes.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} I/[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] became the sole intruder unit for this type of operation, but the results were expensive. The wing lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF claimed shot down.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} Over Europe, the German defences were limited in 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precisie but short-ranged [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvanage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], and could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32-33}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf 110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over 5,000 m (16,400 ft). German pilots would have to detect the bomber early in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} The introduction of newer radar variants, such as the [[Freya radar]], eventually improved the range and identification problems prevelant in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=33\u201354}}\n\nIn mid-1940, the Stab/NJG 1 was based at D\u00fcsseldorf and [[Deelen]] under Falck and equipped with three Bf 110Bs. At B\u00f6nninghardt, I/NJG 1 mustered 34 Bf 110Cs and Ds with 22 operational. At D\u00fcsseldorf, II/NJG 1 could field 11 Ju 88Cs, four operational, and 10 Do 17Zs, nine operational. At [[Cologne]], III/NJG 1 still operated the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]; 13 Bf 109Cs, four operational, three Bf 109Ds and one combat ready, 17 Bf 109Es were present with all but one operational.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=295}} On the night of 19/20 July, [[Werner Streib]], 2/NJG 1, claimed one of the first aerial victories for NJG 1; a [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] shot down at 02:15 near [[Saerbeck]]. Streib would become ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' II/NJG 1 only two months later.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=10}} Only 42 British bombers were claimed shot down in 1940 by German night fighters.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}} Streib claimed 22 aerial victories in 1941, making him the most successful night fighter pilot of the year. [[Paul Gildner]] claimed 21, and Lent claimed 20, making him the third highest claimant in the Luftwaffe that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], who spent several days commanding I/NJG 1 in 1940 during its formation, claimed 13.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226, 240}} At the end of 1941 [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]] joined the wing. Schnaufer would become the most successful night fighter pilot in history, with 121 claims.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=3\u20134}} \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-659-6436-12, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bf 110G night fighter with radar. The 110 was the mainstay of NJG 1]]\nIn mid-1941 NJG 1 began experimenting with [[Lichtenstein radar]], which had become operational.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] shot down six RAF bombers while flying a radar-installed [[Dornier Do 215]]B-5 between 10 August and 30 September 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} The only Lichtenstein radar in service then became unserviceable for the next successes were not recorded until June 1942.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Becker developed his own tactics for attacking a bomber. He stalked the aircraft from the stern, just below the height shown on the radar. After sighting the bomber, he dived and accelerated to avoid being spotted by the tail gunner. Once underneath the enemy, Becker reduced the throttle and matched the speed of the unsuspecting pilot. Becker then climbed steadily to 50 metres (164 metres) from below the target before he pulled up and opened fire. Because the Do 215 lost speed the bomber flew ahead and the through the stream of shells. With this method, the gun sight was rarely needed. These tactics were adopted by the night fighter force.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} The first Ju 88C fighters, equipped with radar were delivered to II./NJG 1 at [[Leeuwarden]] in February 1942. Only four sets arived and it took several weeks for them to become operational. The crews soon came to appreciate the device and were eager to secure it for their aircraft.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Other platforms were tested in NJG 1 at this time. In March 1942 the [[Dornier Do 217]] J was also trialed in service with NJG 1; however the lack of performance made the type unpopular with crews.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=45\u201346}} \n\nIn February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command.

[[Adolf Hitler]] and his armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] were forced to cut planned increases in production. This disruption caused the ''zulieferungskrise'' (sub-components crisis). The increase of aircraft production for the Luftwaffe also came to an abrupt halt. Monthly production failed to increase between July 1943 and March 1944. [[Adam Tooze]] concludes; \"Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armaments miracle in its tracks.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} Production of [[locomotive]]s halted after March 1943 in the Ruhr along with ammunition fuses.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=134\u2013135}} Over 100,000 people were [[dehoused]] in [[Essen]], contributing to the inability to continue production at the [[Krupp]] plant.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=135}}\n\nLuftwaffe night pilots experienced the presence of long-range RAF night fighting aircraft for the first time over Germany. Radar-installed [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s provided indirect [[fighter escort]] to Bomber Command over the Ruhr. These crews came from [[Fighter Command]], and termed their operations as \"flower\" [[sortie]]s. These tactics required RAF pilots to fly to known German night fighter airfields and patrol them in an effort to destroy the Luftwaffe interceptors as they got airborne or landed. These operations were successful and accounted for German aircraft losses in June.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=90-94}} On 14 and 25 June 1943, NJG 1 lost one and two Bf 110s to RAF night fighters.{{sfn|Balss|1997|pp=157\u2013158}} In August 1943, Bomber Command's [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] against [[Peenem\u00fcnde]].

The objective was to disrupt or end [[U-boat]] production in the port city. The introduction of \"[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]\" blew a hole in German radar coverage and the [[bomber stream]]s, aided by OBOE and H2S radar were able to penetrate the defences to devastate the centre of the city. The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) system of radar-controlled night fighters slipping into the bomber stream and then using its own radar to pick out and engage individual bombers had gone. The effects of the raid, and the realisation German radar was temporarily blinded, led to the widespread use of the Wild Boar tactics over the summer, 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=95}} 791 bombers hit the city. German air defences accounted for only 1.5 percent of the attacking force. The Nazi leadership was shaken, and Kammhuber, who resisted calls to abandon the advanced ''Himmelbett'' system, was compelled to find technical solutions to the jamming of Freya, Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrzburg radars. Kammhuber regarded the Wild Boar solution as an emergency measure only.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=94-96}} NJG 1 claimed only three from a total of 12 claimed by night fighter pilots in defence of the city\u2014[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] claimed the rest.

[[Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg]]'s idea was for night fighters equipped with experimental SN-2 radar to cooperate with Y-control systems and \"sluice\" them into the bomber stream. Once there, the night fighters were ordered to transmit direction-finding signals to attract other night fighters. While unguided, the radar operators and night fighter command retained some control over operations with success in August amounting to 250 aircraft claimed shot down on all fronts. The success was offset by losses of 40 killed in the night fighter arm, with only 28 replacements in August. 61 twin-engine night fighters were lost, but only 59 were replaced.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=101\u2013104, 106}} As one German historian noted, the advent of the frequent Mosquito intruder operations from October \"no airfield in Central Germany was safe.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=143}} NJG 1 were engaged in daylight operations against the [[United States Army Air Force]] in August.

By June 1944, I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He 219s, which proved expensive in time and effort; some 90,000 man-hours per aircraft in comparison to 30,000 on the Ju 88C and G. A handful were delivered to II/NJG 1.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=136, 245}} At the start of the battle, NJG 1 was mostly still a Bf 110 unit. Streib commanded Stab/NJG 1 and the wing from Deelen. Meurer commanded I/NJG 1 at Venlo which operated the Bf 110 and He 219. II ''Gruppe'' under von Bonnin at Sint Truiden operated the Bf 110 and the Do 217 while [[Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld]] and [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]] commanded III and IV ''Gruppe'' at Twente and Leeuwarden; both operated the Bf 110.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=127}} \n\nA notable development at this time was in the configuration of German night fighter armament. The [[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]], pioneered in NJG 2, was now in use in NJG 1 during 1943 and 1944. Schnaufer, the leading night fighter in history, estimated he claimed 20 to 30 bombers using the upward firing cannon(s).{{sfn|Price|1973|p=203}} According to Schnaufer, many of the less experienced crew preferred the weapon system to the conventional front-pointing guns.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=203}} 1943 ended with pilots from NJG 1 leading the claim charts. Lent was acknowledged to have 76 and led the Luftwaffe in this field. Streib's total stood at 63, Meurer 62 at his death, Schoenert 56, the deceased Frank, 55, the late Gieger 53, Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld 51, Becker, Gildner and Knacker\u2014all of whom had 44\u2014were killed in the year. Schnaufer and Vinke had claimed 42 and 37 respectively. [[Walter Ehle]], killed on 18 November became the earliest casualty of the battle.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} At this time, German fighter fighters had abandoned the old wild boar operations along with the rigid beacon-based ''Himmelbett'' system for a simple practice of using their own radar to detect bombers once ground controllers led them to the bomber stream. When there, pilots were expected to fight until fuel or ammunition was expended. The tame boar method predominated in what was to become a successful period for the night fighter force.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=127}} \n\n\nIn the midst of the battle, I/NJG 1 lost group commander Meurer\u2014with 65 claims\u2014the third highest scoring night fighter of the war at the time in January 1944. He utilised the Schr\u00e4ge Musik weapon too close to a British bomber which exploded and took Meurer with it.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=110}} In March 1944 another fighter leader, Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld was killed on day 12.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=236}} During the following weeks Bomber Command selected southwest Germany as its main area of operations, allowing for their return over neutral [[Switzerland]]. The Luftwaffe responded by transferring II and III/NJG 1 to France. III/NJG 1 operated from [[Laon]] from 20 April. Night fighter operations over France proved costly for the Luftwaffe. Bomber Command flew on moonlit nights and were provided with strong Mosquito fighter support. Luftwaffe pilots hardly managed to engage the bomber streams.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=155, 159}}\n\nOn 23/24 March 1944, Harris authorised a sixteenth, and final attack upon Berlin nearly five weeks after the last; having postponed it from 21 March. 811 bombers set out, with 147 providing diversion raids to [[Le Havre]] in France. [[No. 105 Squadron RAF]] sent 12 Mosquitos to Twente, Venlo and Sint Truinden; all home to NJG 1 units. A further 17 Mosquitos were sent on pathfinder operations.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|pp=185-186}} NJG 2 and 3 were to plan their interceptions along the transit routes near [[Sylt]]. [[NJG 5]], and [[NJG 6]] were held for operations near the [[Baltic]] coast and Berlin and target area. [[NJG 4]] and 1 were apparently reserved for action against the returning bombers. The diversions had little effect. NJG 1, 2 and 3 operated along the bomber stream route all night.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|p=197}} Of the 72 aircraft Bomber Command reported lost, 45 were against predictive anti-aircraft fire, 18 to night fighters and nine to unknown causes.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|p=207}} The Battle of Berlin cost Bomber Command 497 aircraft with a further 72 crashing in England.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|p=223}}\n\nThe decline of the Luftwaffe night fighter force began only three months after arguably its greatest success. Aerial resistance decline by day and night and a state of [[air supremacy]] was achieved by Allied air forces. The Luftwaffe's shortage of fuel to operate and provide sufficient training for fighter crews became apparent.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=166-167}} The OKL had not foreseen the collapse of its day and night fighter force and had assumed that Bomber Command would not resume deep-penetration raids for some time. Incredibly, the high command thought the Luftwaffe could prevent a landing in Western Europe. By June 1944, most night fighter units had been moved to the periphery of [[Luftflotte Reich]]'s territory in [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and Western Europe. Only NJG 1 and 3 remained in Germany.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=168}} In July, the [[Normandy Campaign]] nearing its nadir, NJG 1 were moved to airfields spread over [[Westphalia]]. The collapse of the German front in Normandy in August necessitated NJG 1s evacuation of all ''staffel'' from the [[Low Countries]] in September 1944 to [[Munster]], [[Dortmund]], [[Dusseldorf]] ]and [[Fritzlar]]. The [[Wehrmacht]]'s hold on the eastern Netherlands allowed for the return of elements of NJG 1 for operations in Twente in November 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=170-171}} Stab/NJG 1 relocated to [[Paderborn]], I/NJG 1 to Munster, II/NJG 1 to Dusseldorf, III/NJG 1 to Fritzlar and IV/NJG 1 to Dortmund. 2/NJG 1 was detached and operated from Niedermendig. All ''gruppen'' were subordinated to the 3. Jagddivision.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=172-173}}\n\nThe OKL correctly surmised that high-frequency technology rather than the number and quality of night fighters would decide the next phase of the battle. They drew the wrong conclusions from their successes in early 1944 and wrongly assumed the straight forward devices such as Naxos, SN-2 and [[Flensburg radar detector]]s coupled with a high level of training would inflict severe damage on the enemy provided their secrets could be kept from the enemy and enough of them made available. Production was concentrated on SN-2, while centimetric radar came low on the list of priorities. The radar types in use, used long-wave radar waves which were prone to jamming and created high drag. The decision not to fit SN-2 to He 219s caused high losses of the type. Only Ju 88 units received Naxos. In December 1944, a final concerted effort to regain the high-frequency lead was made in the SN-3 radar.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=176-178}}\n\nIn equipment the German night fighter force remained capable. The Bf 110 may have been considered obsolete, but in the hands of experienced pilots it remained a formidable night fighter. The victory claims submitted by I/NJG 1 (He 219) and II/NJG 1 (Bf 110) have been analysed from June 1944 onward. Operating under the same conditions II/NJG 1 regularly shot down more bombers and the He 219-group. Nevertheles, Bf 110G production was tapering off as Ju 88G production increased to 339 in December 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=185}} The technicians at [[Heinkel]] cooperated closely with operational units to produce modifications at request, but these were contradictory. In II/NJG 1 pilots argued for a cannon of 30 mm calibre, only later to show a preference for 20 mms [owing to the low-muzzle velocity it required firing from short-range increasing the danger to the German crew]. When the crews complained about the two-man He 219, the manufacturer made modifications for a third member, only for the proposal to be dropped for a complete redesign with this in mind. When it was realised the He 219s performance over the RAF Mosquito proved insufficient the new [[Heinkel He 419]] \"Mosquito hunter\" was planned, but too late for production. I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He 219A-0, A-2 and A-5s. The A-0 were brought up to latter standards.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=188-190}} II/NJG 1 operated small numbers of He 219s, but most were not comfortable with the type and they found the performance was not significantly better than the Bf 110. The crews did not like being perched ahead of the engines and reiterated the drawback of the missing third member or \"lookout.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=190}} \n\nFrom July 1944 to May 1945, Bomber Command made 10 large raids per month. From October 1944 60-80 Mosquitos flew into Germany on an average of ten nights per month. The He 219 pilots in NJG 1 could do little to oppose them. In July 1944 He 219s claimed three of them; but only one near the British aircraft's operating height of 9,000 m (29, 530 ft). Soon, the task of opposing the Mosquito intruders fell to single-engine units. Confounding operational issues further, distrust permeated between crews and ground controllers for jamming and the use of decoy aircraft made interceptions difficult. Pilots had no choice but to follow their directions because the only long-range radars, Naxos and Flensburg, became useless by July 1944, and SN-2 was beginning to show signs it had been compromised. The British tactics of flying below 3,000 m (9, 840 ft) caused so many contacts on the SN-2 screens it was difficult to identify and follow a specific target. Window and jamming made it very difficult for night fighters to find the bomber stream.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=200\u2013201}} The intruder danger became so acute by December that I/NJG 1 reported operations on only six nights claiming one victory for six losses.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=205}}\n\n===1945: Destruction of the Kammhuber Line===\n[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Fighter Command C4212A.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|This gun sequence, taken from George Hardy's aircraft, shows a 11/NJG 1 Bf 110 piloted by Heinz Vinke shortly before it crashed killing the crew.]]\n\n== Commanding officers ==\n\n;Kommodore\n* Oberst [[Wolfgang Falck]], 26 June 1940 \u2013 30 June 1943{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Oberst [[Werner Streib]], 1 July 1943 \u2013 March 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Oberstleutnant [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]], March 1944 \u2013 May 1945{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n\n;I/NJG 1\n* Hauptmann [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], 1 July 1940 \u2013 6 October 1940{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Major [[Werner Streib]], 18 October 1940 \u2013 1 July 1943{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Hauptmann [[Hans-Dieter Frank]], 1 July 1943 \u2013 27 September 1943{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Hauptmann [[Manfred Meurer]], 28 September 1943 \u2013 21 January 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Major [[Paul F\u00f6rster]], January 1944 - 1 October 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n* Hauptmann [[Werner Baake]], 2 October 1944 \u2013 8 May 1945{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}}\n\n;II/NJG 1\n* Hauptmann Stillfried 2 October 1940 - 6 October 1940{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Major [[Walter Ehle]], 6 October 1940 \u2013 17 November 1943{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Major [[Eckart-Wilhelm von Bonin]], 18 November 1943 \u2013 25 October 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Hauptmann Breves, 26 October 1944 - 8 May 1945{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n\n;III/NJG 1\n* Hauptmann von Bothmer, 1 July 1940 - 1 November 1940{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Hauptmann Sch\u00f6n, 1 November 1940 - 1 February 1941{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Hauptmann von Graeve 8 February 1941 - 5 June 1942{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Hauptmann [[Wolfgang Thimmig]], 6 June 1942 \u2013 31 May 1943{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Major [[Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld]], 1 June 1943 \u2013 20 February 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Major [[Martin Drewes]], 1 March 1944 \u2013 8 May 1945{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n\n;IV/NJG 1\n* Major [[Helmut Lent]], 1 October 1942 \u2013 1 August 1943{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Hauptmann [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]], 1 August 1943 \u2013 1 March 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Major [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]], 1 March 1944 \u2013 26 October 1944{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n* Hauptmann [[Hermann Greiner]], 1 November 1944 \u2013 8 May 1945{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}}\n\n== References==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n;Bibliography \n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Aders\n  |first=Gebhard\n  |year=1978\n  |title=History of the German Night Fighter Force, 1917\u20131945\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Janes \n  |isbn=0-354-01247-9\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Boiten\n  |first=Theo\n  |year=1997\n  |title=Nachtjagd: the night fighter versus bomber war over the Third Reich, 1939\u201345\n  |trans-title=|language=English\n  |location=London\n  |publisher=Crowood Press\n  |isbn=978-1-86126-086-4\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Boog\n  |first1=Horst\n  |authorlink1=Horst Boog\n  |last2=Krebs\n  |first2=Gerhard\n  |last3=Vogel\n  |first3=Detlef\n  |title=Germany and the Second World War: Volume VII: The Strategic Air War in Europe and the War in the West and East Asia, 1943-1944/5\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIHKkzcf_bcC\n  |year=2006\n  |publisher=Clarendon Press\n  |isbn=978-0-19-822889-9\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Bowman\n  |first=Martin\n  |year=2011\n  |title=100 Group (Bomber Support): RAF Bomber Command in World War II\n  |location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire\n  |publisher=Pen and Sword\n  |isbn=978-1-84415-418-0\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last1=Caldwell\n  |first1=Donald L.\n  |last2=Muller\n  |first2=Richard R.\n  |authorlink2=Richard R.

In 2019, Fernando stood down as CEO of [[Dilmah]], as his son, Dilhan, was appointed the new head of the company.\n\n==Early life==\nFernando was born in [[Negombo#Zones and neighborhood|Pallansena]], [[Negombo]], [[British Ceylon]] in 1930. Fernando attended [[Maris Stella College]] in Negombo and [[Saint Joseph's College, Colombo]] in his youth. His first job was as a inspector for a U.S. petroleum company.<ref name=\"Fernando\" /> \n\n==Career==\nFernando was one of the first Sri Lankan tea tasters to be selected to learn about tea in Mincing Lane, London. Up until this time, the prevailing colonial system did not believe Sri Lankans were capable of assessing tea as they felt they ate too much curry which would affect their assessment of the taste. However, Fernando was one of five who were selected and trained in London.<ref>http://www.asianenterprise.biz/merrill-fernando-beyond-the-tea-garden/full.html</ref>\n\nIt was in London that Fernando witnessed a system of colonial exploitation that treated tea producing countries as raw material suppliers whereas branding and value addition were done overseas and all profits accrued never reached the producers.<ref>http://fridaymagazine.ae/features/people/friday-talks-to-dilmah-s-founder-merrill-fernando-1.1978304</ref> This greatly disturbed Fernando, who dreamed that someday he would create his own brand of tea where the producing country would receive all profits from value addition and thereby get their due recognition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706234049/http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |archive-date=2013-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He wanted to bring integrity back into tea.<ref>http://gulfbusiness.com/pictures-new-luxury-tea-lounge-opens-in-dubai/</ref><ref>http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/pages/profile-detail.aspx?profile=mfernando</ref>  With this intention he became, quite literally, the \u201cface\u201d of his brand, his smiling persona emblazoned on tea packets around the world as he urged people: \u201cDo try it.\u201d He wanted to bring quality, authenticity and ethics back to tea. Fresh tea is rich in [[antioxidants]] and so he wanted to offer his consumers tea that was garden fresh handpicked and packed at its origin. Fernando strongly believed that consumers had the right to know exactly what they were drinking and so he pioneered the concept of single origin [[tea]].<ref>http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/Sri%20Lanka/Case%20study%201.pdf</ref>\n\n==Charity work==\nFernando believes in the philosophy of seeing business as a matter of human service. 10% of all [[Dilmah]] profits are channelled to the MJF Charitable Foundation <ref>http://www.mjffoundation.org</ref> which is working towards the dignified empowerment of underprivileged people around Sri Lanka.<ref>http://www.dilmahtea.com/tea-inspired-ebooks/free/business_is_matter_of_human_service/index.html</ref>\nEach year, the foundation cares for over 5,000 children in its Child Development Centres, nurtures over 1000 children through the MJF Kids, empowers women, and has created over 600 entrepreneurs through the Small Entrepreneur Programme \u2013 SEP\u2013 and uplifted the lives of countless plantation workers. These are only a few of over 100 projects the MJF Foundation implements each year.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170226/business-times/empower-culinary-hospitality-school-receives-prestigious-worldchefs-certification-229949.html</ref><ref>http://www.ft.lk/article/600891/Empower-Culinary-and-Hospitality-School-receives-prestigious-World-Chefs-certification</ref>\n\n==Sustainability==\nIn 2007, Fernando extended his commitment to human service by establishing Dilmah Conservation www.dilmahconservation.org which focuses on working towards a more sustainable use of the environment in partnership with IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Dilmah Conservation initiative aims to foster respect for the environment and ensure its protection by encouraging a harmonious co-existence of man and nature.<ref>http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Tea-veteran-wants-plantation-industry-out-of-State-control--136040.html</ref> In 2010, Fernando made a Declaration of a Core Commitment to Sustainability which expanded the Dilmah Conservation scope and scale to include initiatives in the areas of Habitat & Species Conservation \u2013 both terrestrial and marine, Ecosystems Restoration, Environmental Education and Culture & Indigenous Communities.<ref>http://businessforpeace.no/meet-the-winners-merrill-joseph-fernando/</ref> In 2016, The Merrill J. Fernando Eco Innovation Awards was initiated calling for breakthrough, purposeful proposals of well-developed concepts and working prototypes that seek to solve current national and global environmental issues in the areas of [[Waste]], [[Water]], [[Energy]], Blue Economy and [[Biodiversity]].<ref>http://www.ft.lk/article/581614/Merrill-J.-Fernando-Eco-Innovation-Awards-rewards-creative-innovators#sthash.Xu5XcejI.dpuf</ref> \u201cI want to prevent the hardship of young entrepreneurs of today when I compare myself with the hardship that I went through in launching Dilmah Tea,\u201d Fernando said at the awards ceremony.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/161127/business-times/merrill-j-the-entrepreneur-who-beat-all-odds-to-succeed-in-his-venture-217954.html</ref>\n\n==Awards & achievements ==\nDilmah is the first producer owned tea brand in the world and is among the top ten tea brands. Merrill with over 70 years of expertise in tea has the distinction of being the most experienced teamaker in the world today. In 2005, Dilmah received an award from the Medinge Group for its work as a Brand with a Conscience and also received a Presidential Merit Award for contribution to the preservation of the environment in the same year. On the 6th of May 2015, Fernando received the Business for Peace Award in Oslo, Norway.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150412/business-times/dilmahs-merril-j-selected-as-oslo-business-for-peace-2015-honouree-143728.html</ref>  The [[Business for Peace Foundation]] annually names honourees for the Oslo Business for Peace Award in recognition of business persons who, through their own actions and commitments truly are business worthy, promoting socially responsible and ethical business practice in an outstanding way, and standing out as examples to the world.<ref>http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Speeches/2015/Oslo-Business-for-Peace-Awards/</ref> In September 2016 Merrill was honoured with the Global Businessman Award at the [[Ada Derana]] Sri Lankan of the Year 2016. The award seeks to honour and celebrate the outstanding achievements of individuals/groups whose efforts have far-reaching influence on the country, positively impacting the local community and thereby help place Sri Lanka on the international limelight.<br>\n\nOn November 30, 2016 Fernando was honoured with the FIRST Award for Responsible Capitalism and the award was presented by Philip Hammond MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, at the Royal Automobile Club, London. The Award recognises business ethics, emphasising his unique philosophy of making business a matter of human service. Fernando is the only Sri Lankan to have received this Award. The previous award winners include Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi the enormously respected CEO of PepsiCo, the Prince of Wales, and Prof. John Kay of the London School of Economics, to name a few.<ref>http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=37094</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSm7NIN5qRk</ref><ref>https://pressroom.dilmahtea.com/dilmah-in-news/celebrating-150-years-of-ceylon-tea-by-importing-tea--83.html</ref>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: mintcream; padding: 30px;margin: 20px 0\">\n* Honoured as a One of the Three Most Admired Leaders in Sri Lanka\u2019, he was chosen for his passionate commitment to \u201cQuality and Integrity\u201d, and for the philosophy he established at the heart of his Dilmah Tea business.

In 2019, Fernando stood down as CEO of [[Dilmah]], as his son, Dilhan, was appointed the new head of the company.\n\n==Early life==\nFernando was born in [[Negombo#Zones and neighborhood|Pallansena]], [[Negombo]], [[British Ceylon]] in 1930. Fernando attended [[Maris Stella College]] in Negombo and [[Saint Joseph's College, Colombo]] in his youth. His first job was as a inspector for a U.S. petroleum company.<ref name=\"Fernando\" /> \n\n==Career==\nFernando was one of the first Sri Lankan tea tasters to be selected to learn about tea in Mincing Lane, London. Up until this time, the prevailing colonial system did not believe Sri Lankans were capable of assessing tea as they felt they ate too much curry which would affect their assessment of the taste. However, Fernando was one of five who were selected and trained in London.<ref>http://www.asianenterprise.biz/merrill-fernando-beyond-the-tea-garden/full.html</ref>\n\nIt was in London that Fernando witnessed a system of colonial exploitation that treated tea producing countries as raw material suppliers whereas branding and value addition were done overseas and all profits accrued never reached the producers.<ref>http://fridaymagazine.ae/features/people/friday-talks-to-dilmah-s-founder-merrill-fernando-1.1978304</ref> This greatly disturbed Fernando, who dreamed that someday he would create his own brand of tea where the producing country would receive all profits from value addition and thereby get their due recognition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706234049/http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |archive-date=2013-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He wanted to bring integrity back into tea.<ref>http://gulfbusiness.com/pictures-new-luxury-tea-lounge-opens-in-dubai/</ref><ref>http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/pages/profile-detail.aspx?profile=mfernando</ref>  With this intention he became, quite literally, the \u201cface\u201d of his brand, his smiling persona emblazoned on tea packets around the world as he urged people: \u201cDo try it.\u201d He wanted to bring quality, authenticity and ethics back to tea. Fresh tea is rich in [[antioxidants]] and so he wanted to offer his consumers tea that was garden fresh handpicked and packed at its origin. Fernando strongly believed that consumers had the right to know exactly what they were drinking and so he pioneered the concept of single origin [[tea]].<ref>http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/Sri%20Lanka/Case%20study%201.pdf</ref>\n\n==Charity work==\nFernando believes in the philosophy of seeing business as a matter of human service. 10% of all [[Dilmah]] profits are channelled to the MJF Charitable Foundation <ref>http://www.mjffoundation.org</ref> which is working towards the dignified empowerment of underprivileged people around Sri Lanka.<ref>http://www.dilmahtea.com/tea-inspired-ebooks/free/business_is_matter_of_human_service/index.html</ref>\nEach year, the foundation cares for over 5,000 children in its Child Development Centres, nurtures over 1000 children through the MJF Kids, empowers women, and has created over 600 entrepreneurs through the Small Entrepreneur Programme \u2013 SEP\u2013 and uplifted the lives of countless plantation workers. These are only a few of over 100 projects the MJF Foundation implements each year.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170226/business-times/empower-culinary-hospitality-school-receives-prestigious-worldchefs-certification-229949.html</ref><ref>http://www.ft.lk/article/600891/Empower-Culinary-and-Hospitality-School-receives-prestigious-World-Chefs-certification</ref>\n\n==Sustainability==\nIn 2007, Fernando extended his commitment to human service by establishing Dilmah Conservation www.dilmahconservation.org which focuses on working towards a more sustainable use of the environment in partnership with IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Dilmah Conservation initiative aims to foster respect for the environment and ensure its protection by encouraging a harmonious co-existence of man and nature.<ref>http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Tea-veteran-wants-plantation-industry-out-of-State-control--136040.html</ref> In 2010, Fernando made a Declaration of a Core Commitment to Sustainability which expanded the Dilmah Conservation scope and scale to include initiatives in the areas of Habitat & Species Conservation \u2013 both terrestrial and marine, Ecosystems Restoration, Environmental Education and Culture & Indigenous Communities.<ref>http://businessforpeace.no/meet-the-winners-merrill-joseph-fernando/</ref> In 2016, The Merrill J. Fernando Eco Innovation Awards was initiated calling for breakthrough, purposeful proposals of well-developed concepts and working prototypes that seek to solve current national and global environmental issues in the areas of [[Waste]], [[Water]], [[Energy]], Blue Economy and [[Biodiversity]].<ref>http://www.ft.lk/article/581614/Merrill-J.-Fernando-Eco-Innovation-Awards-rewards-creative-innovators#sthash.Xu5XcejI.dpuf</ref> \u201cI want to prevent the hardship of young entrepreneurs of today when I compare myself with the hardship that I went through in launching Dilmah Tea,\u201d Fernando said at the awards ceremony.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/161127/business-times/merrill-j-the-entrepreneur-who-beat-all-odds-to-succeed-in-his-venture-217954.html</ref>\n\n==Awards & achievements ==\nDilmah is the first producer owned tea brand in the world and is among the top ten tea brands. Merrill with over 70 years of expertise in tea has the distinction of being the most experienced teamaker in the world today. In 2005, Dilmah received an award from the Medinge Group for its work as a Brand with a Conscience and also received a Presidential Merit Award for contribution to the preservation of the environment in the same year. On the 6th of May 2015, Fernando received the Business for Peace Award in Oslo, Norway.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150412/business-times/dilmahs-merril-j-selected-as-oslo-business-for-peace-2015-honouree-143728.html</ref>  The [[Business for Peace Foundation]] annually names honourees for the Oslo Business for Peace Award in recognition of business persons who, through their own actions and commitments truly are business worthy, promoting socially responsible and ethical business practice in an outstanding way, and standing out as examples to the world.<ref>http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Speeches/2015/Oslo-Business-for-Peace-Awards/</ref> In September 2016 Merrill was honoured with the Global Businessman Award at the [[Ada Derana]] Sri Lankan of the Year 2016. The award seeks to honour and celebrate the outstanding achievements of individuals/groups whose efforts have far-reaching influence on the country, positively impacting the local community and thereby help place Sri Lanka on the international limelight.<br>\n\nOn November 30, 2016 Fernando was honoured with the FIRST Award for Responsible Capitalism and the award was presented by Philip Hammond MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, at the Royal Automobile Club, London. The Award recognises business ethics, emphasising his unique philosophy of making business a matter of human service. Fernando is the only Sri Lankan to have received this Award. The previous award winners include Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi the enormously respected CEO of PepsiCo, the Prince of Wales, and Prof. John Kay of the London School of Economics, to name a few.<ref>http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=37094</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSm7NIN5qRk</ref><ref>https://pressroom.dilmahtea.com/dilmah-in-news/celebrating-150-years-of-ceylon-tea-by-importing-tea--83.html</ref>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: lightcyan; padding: 30px;margin: 20px 0\">\n* Honoured as a One of the Three Most Admired Leaders in Sri Lanka\u2019, he was chosen for his passionate commitment to \u201cQuality and Integrity\u201d, and for the philosophy he established at the heart of his Dilmah Tea business.
