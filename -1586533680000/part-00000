Defence cuts gradually reduced the TA formations to a parachute brigade and then a single reserve battalion.

By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia-Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plamam Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills.<ref name=csmwilliams/> The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The [[Company Sergeant Major]] (CSM), [[John Williams (British Army officer)|John Williams]], was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams' machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack.

The other battalions are the [[Paratrooper|parachute infantry]] component of the British Army's rapid response formation, [[16 Air Assault Brigade]]. The Paras are the only [[line infantry]] regiment of the British Army that has not been amalgamated with another unit since the end of the [[Second World War]].<ref name=modpara/>\n\nThe Parachute Regiment was formed on 22 June 1940 during the Second World War and eventually raised 17 battalions. In Europe, these battalions formed part of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] and the [[2nd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Independent Parachute Brigade Group]]. Another three battalions served with the [[British Indian Army]] in [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India and Burma]]. The regiment took part in six major parachute assault operations in [[British airborne operations in North Africa|North Africa]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[Operation Tonga|France]], the [[Operation Market Garden|Netherlands]] and [[Operation Varsity|Germany]], often landing ahead of all other troops.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the regiment was reduced to three [[Standing army|regular army]] battalions first assigned to the [[16th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Parachute Brigade]] and later the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Airborne Brigade]]. The reserve [[16th Airborne Division]] was formed using the regiment reserve battalions in the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. Defence cuts gradually reduced the TA formations to a parachute brigade and then a single reserve battalion. In the same time period, the regular army battalions have taken part in operations in [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Suez]], [[EOKA|Cyprus]], [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Borneo]], [[Aden Emergency|Aden]], [[Operation Banner|Northern Ireland]], the [[Falklands War|Falklands]], the [[Kosovo War]], the [[Balkans]], [[Operation Palliser|Sierra Leone]], [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], at times being reinforced by men from the reserve battalion.\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:British parachute troops Norwich 1941.jpg|thumb|British parachute troops on exercise in [[Norwich]] 23 June 1941.]]\nImpressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the [[Battle of France]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], directed the [[War Office]] to investigate the possibility of creating a [[corps]] of 5,000 parachute troops.<ref>Otway, p.21</ref> On 22 June 1940, [[No. 2 Commando]] was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.<ref>Shott & McBride, p.4</ref><ref>Moreman, p.91</ref> It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, [[Operation Colossus]], on 10 February 1941.<ref name=guard218>Guard, p.218</ref> In September, the battalion was re-designated the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st Parachute Battalion]] and assigned to the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]].<ref name=guard218/> To fill out the brigade, the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd]], [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|3rd]] and [[4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment|4th Parachute Battalion]]s were raised by calling for volunteers from all units in the British Army.<ref name=guard218/>\n\nThe first operation by the Parachute Regiment was [[Operation Biting]] in February 1942.
