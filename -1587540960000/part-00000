He currently presides over the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures]], based in [[Alexandria, Egypt]]. He is also President of the Executive Committee of the [[Foundation for the Three Cultures and the Three Religions]], based in [[Seville, Spain]], a founding member of the C-100 Davos Forum for the Dialogue of Civilisations and religions, and was formerly Executive Vice-President of the [[BNP Paribas]], [[Paris]]. His daughter is [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Audrey Azoulay]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Essaouira]], in 1941 to a Berber, as he declared it himself,  [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jewish]] family, Andr\u00e9 Azoulay was educated in Paris where he studied economics, journalism and international relations. Previously to his current position as Counsellor to the King of Morocco, Azoulay, had a long career within the [[Paribas]] Bank in Paris (1968 to 1990) where, as Executive Vice-President, he covered the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa Region]] as well as heading the bank\u2019s Public Affairs department.\n\nAs Counsellor of the late King Hassan II from (1991 to 1999), and since then of king Mohammed VI, Andr\u00e9 Azoulay has largely contributed to the implementation of economic reforms, which have been applied throughout the kingdom since their inception in the early 1990s. He also played a significant role in the privatisation and deregulation programs which began in 1993. He emphasized the need for sustaining the role of the private sector and encouraging the international investment to sustain economic growth in Morocco. Azoulay has also largely contributed to promote Morocco throughout the world.\n\n==Peace builder==\nAzoulay is also known for his historical input in the follow-up of the peace process in the Middle East and the many initiatives he has been involved in the perspective of deepening the logic of reconciliation between Jews and Muslims.
