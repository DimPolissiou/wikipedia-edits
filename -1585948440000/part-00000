Available health is represented by a percentage number on the screen. The combat is high-paced and frenetic: The levels typically consist of a series of elaborate arenas, in which the player will defeat a set number of re-spawning enemies before proceeding to the next. Enemies range from soldiers with rocket launchers to gigantic charging robots to shrieking suicide bombers without heads and holding bombs. The environments include [[Egyptian pyramids|ancient Egyptian pyramids]], tropical rainforests, and medieval castles. ''Serious Sam'' features [[cooperative gameplay]] through a split-screen mode and via the internet.\n\n== Episodes ==\n''Serious Sam'' consists of two episodes: ''Serious Sam: The First Encounter'' and ''Serious Sam: The Second Encounter''. A [[fan-made]] level-pack, ''Dark Island'', was included in ''Serious Sam: Gold''. The games are on separate CDs (in the UK version) and are identical to their individual releases, except that the Sam character model for ''The First Encounter'' was modified to match the one used in ''The Second Encounter''. After the release of the remakes, both titles had \"Classic\" added to the name to prevent confusion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/41050 |title=Steam Community: Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter |work=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/41060 |title=Steam Community: Serious Sam Classic: The Second Encounter |work=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Serious Sam: The First Encounter'' ===\n{{Main|Serious Sam: The First Encounter}}\n''The First Encounter'' was the first game in the series; it had been in the making since 1996 and had a video showing its early game play in 2000. ''The First Encounter'' was originally developed by Croteam as a demonstrator for their engine and this is the reason why some countries saw its initial release priced at less than half the price of other games in the genre.\n\n=== ''Serious Sam: The Second Encounter'' ===\n''The Second Encounter'' starts where the previous game left off, with Sam traveling to Sirius on the SSS Centerprice. Unfortunately, the starship is accidentally hit by the \"Croteam crate-bus\" and plummets down to Earth's surface. As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into [[Central America]] in the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a \"back-up starship\" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case anything ever happened to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam currently is, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination. With this new objective, Sam storms through [[Mesoamerica]], then travels to [[Mesopotamia]] and finally to [[Medieval Europe]] where the back-up starship is located. During his journey, Sam battles two of Mental's portal guardians: a powerful Mayan spirit named [[Kukulkan]] the Wind God and a biomechanical creature called the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, Sam confronts the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the [[Holy Grail]], Mordekai the Summoner. After a glorious battle with Mordekai and his spawning minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the Cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail in the palms of his hands, followed by his sarcastic confessions of his sins in a booth to Mental, during which he tells Mental that \"he's coming to get him.\" During the end credits, Sam activates the back-up starship, which turns out to be a rocket, and travels back into space toward Sirius, with the \"Croteam Big-Heads\" cheering him on. The story continues on to ''[[Serious Sam II]]''.\n\nOther than the more varied locations, ''The Second Encounter'' features some additional weapons\u2014a [[chainsaw]], a [[flamethrower]], a [[sniper rifle]], and the powerful Serious Bomb\u2014and a number of new monsters that Sam has to face. This game has also seen the release of a level-pack titled ''Dark Island'', featuring fan-made levels for single and multiplayer mode. ''The Second Encounter'' soundtrack featured three [[instrumental]] songs from the Croatian heavy-metal band Undercode.\n\n== Development ==\nCroteam created their own engine for use in both ''The First Encounter'' and ''The Second Encounter''. Named the \"Serious Engine\", it is designed to cope with extremely large view distances and massive numbers of models by implementing [[level of detail]] rendering. Most contemporary FPS engines were developed for a limited draw distance and only a few animating models (i.e. enemies) on screen at a time. The Serious Engine is very efficient, capable of maintaining dozens of moving enemies (often stampedes) and enormous enemies, even on a modest system challenging the well known [[id Tech]], [[Unreal Engine]] or [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engines. The \"Serious Engine\" can render through both [[Direct3D]] or [[OpenGL]] and, while it does not support pixel or vertex shaders, it is optimised for [[Direct3D]] 7's hardware transformation, clipping and lighting. The \"Serious Engine\" is available for licensing from Croteam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.croteam.com/engine_overview.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007101436/http://www.croteam.com/engine_overview.shtml |title=Serious Engine Overview |work=[[Croteam]] |archive-date=7 October 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA more powerful iteration of the \"Serious Engine\" was developed for use in ''Serious Sam 2'' and is known as \"Serious Engine 2\".

It includes detailed shading, and enemies are completely remodeled to look more realistic. This engine is also being developed to harness the full capacity of HDR and High Definition mapping. An updated version, Serious Engine 3.5, is used in ''[[Serious Sam 3: BFE]]''.\n\nThe latest version is the Serious Engine 4, which [[Croteam]] used in their most recent game, [[The Talos Principle]].\n\nIn March 2016, Croteam released Serious Engine v1.10 as [[free and open source software]] on [[GitHub]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] v2.<ref>[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Serious-Engine-Open-Source Croteam Open-Sources The Serious Engine] by [[Michael Larabel]] on [[Phoronix]] (11 March 2016)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croteam.com/serious-sam-source-code-released/|title=Serious Sam\u2019s Serious Engine source code release|date=11 March 2016|publisher=Croteam |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palm OS version ===\nIn November 2001, [[Global Star Software]] announced the completion of a [[Palm OS]] version of ''The First Encounter'' developed by [[InterActive Vision]], to be released in early December.

The Xbox version includes all of the levels from both of the PC games. As a result, weapons from ''The Second Encounter'' were added to the levels that were part of ''The First Encounter'' on PC. The levels were made smaller by removing the areas outside of the playing area. Unlike the PC version, Sam can't exit too far out of the playing area. This is due to the smaller amount of memory available in the Xbox. The gameplay was given a more arcade touch. A life system was implemented into the single-player game making use of the score. Every 100,000 points grants the player a new life, which allows respawning at the place of death rather than at a save point. Combo points were added for killing multiple enemies at the same time, which allows the player to increase his/her score at a fast pace. Further changes to the game include the addition of treasure and the tweaking of save points. Save points are designated by a red phone booth. Auto-aiming was also added to the Xbox version to compensate for the degree of control usually offered by a keyboard and mouse setup.\n\n== Remake ==\n\nCroteam took their publishing rights from 2K Games to new startup [[Devolver Digital]], after [[2K Games]] became uninterested in ''Serious Sam'', waiting for their long rival ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'' to finish.\nBoth episodes were remade using Serious Engine 3 featuring updated visuals, better performance and lush environments, all in high-definition.

Originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]] only, ''Serious Sam''{{'s}} rising popularity resulted in the porting of the episodes to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Linux]] and [[Palm OS]], as well as in the remaking of both episodes for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Xbox 360]] in high-definition.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of [[protagonist]] Sam \"Serious\" Stone and his fight against the forces of the notorious [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] overlord Mental who seeks to destroy humanity.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nEnemies spawn frequently and attack in large waves from across the game map, and the player is intended to dodge their projectiles and charges by jumping and strafing rather than by taking cover. Health and armor are non-regenerative on most difficulty levels, and instead are replenished with the health and armor packs which are littered throughout the game. Available health is represented by a percentage number on the screen. The combat is high-paced and frenetic: The levels typically consist of a series of elaborate arenas, in which the player will defeat a set number of re-spawning enemies before proceeding to the next. Enemies range from soldiers with rocket launchers to gigantic charging robots to shrieking suicide bombers without heads and holding bombs. The environments include [[Egyptian pyramids|ancient Egyptian pyramids]], tropical rainforests, and medieval castles.
