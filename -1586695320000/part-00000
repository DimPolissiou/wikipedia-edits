Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\nMost of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to Sufism and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism is the correct way to reach God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Y\u0131lmaz|first=H\u00fcseyin|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Caliphate_Redefined.html?id=KvbWDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y|title=Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought|date=2018-01-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8804-7|language=en}}</ref> Because the matters of jurisprudence and shariah were state matters, the state sponsored Sufi religious dominance came into play.

On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparallelled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the [[Valide Sultan]]. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"[[Sultanate of the women|Sultanate of Women]]\".

First, the [[Madrasa]] (''{{lang|ota|Medrese}}'') was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition.

The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces. The representatives formed the [[Imperial Government of the Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThis eclectic administration was apparent even in the diplomatic correspondence of the Empire, which was initially undertaken in the [[Greek language]] to the west.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC|accessdate=12 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC/page/n72 78]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tughra]] were calligraphic monograms, or signatures, of the Ottoman Sultans, of which there were 35.

The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative ''Qanun'', i.e., laws, a system based upon the Turkic ''[[Yassa]]'' and ''[[T\u00f6re (law)|T\u00f6re]]'', which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|An Ottoman trial, 1877]]\n\nThese court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive; for instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

Presiding over Islamic courts would be a ''Qadi'', or judge. Since the closing of the ''[[ijtihad]]'', or ''Gate of Interpretation, Qadis ''throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent, and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered.<ref name=\"Benton 109-110\"/> However, the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure, leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Ottoman legal system saw substantial reform.

The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included Janissary, [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehter\u00e2n]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]].

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years.

The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West.<ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who were a very powerful military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt, executed the leaders, and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into a Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  The large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: Non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the end result that they came out as one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Seljuk Empire]], were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits, and customs, and therefore the empire has been described as a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] empire.<ref name=\"iranica\">{{cite encyclopedia|first=O. |last=\u00d6zg\u00fcndenli |title=Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |edition=online |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005207/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Studies on Persianate Societies\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite book|first1 = F.|last1 = Walter|title = Music of the Ottoman court|chapter = The Departure of Turkey from the 'Persianate' Musical Sphere|chapter-url = http://www.vwb-verlag.com/Katalog/m641.html}}</ref> Intercultural marriages also played a part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was [[Muhayyel\u00e2t]] (\"Fancies\") by [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was by an Armenian named [[Vartan Pasha]].

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents; in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously; for instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures.

Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created.

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science, and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nOver the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.

Fuat Koprulu championed the ''[[Ghazi thesis]]'' that saw the Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale. They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia.<ref>Ronald C.

Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\nMost of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to Sufism and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism is the correct way to reach God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Y\u0131lmaz|first=H\u00fcseyin|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Caliphate_Redefined.html?id=KvbWDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y|title=Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought|date=2018-01-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8804-7|language=en}}</ref> Because the matters of jurisprudence and shariah were state matters, the state sponsored Sufi religious dominance came into play.

The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic [[Iran]] remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p = 38}} According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of [[Sunni|orthodox]] Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.<ref name=\"Kapucu\">{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC/page/n71 77]}}</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, or as a dynastic institution, the House of Osman, was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nspmqLKPU-wC&pg=PA199|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93243-1|page=199}}</ref> In Europe, only the [[House of Habsburg]] had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparallelled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

Religious officials formed the Ulama, who had control of religious teachings and theology, and also the Empire's judicial system,  giving them a major voice in day-to-day affairs in communities across the Empire (but not including the non-Muslim millets). They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan [[Selim III]]. His successor Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808\u20131839) first won ulama approval before proposing similar reforms.<ref>Kemal H.

The caliphate was abolished, madrasas were closed down, and the sharia courts abolished.  He replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin letters, ended the religious school system, and gave women some political rights.  Many rural traditionalists never accepted this secularization, and by the 1990s they were reasserting a demand for a larger role for Islam.<ref>{{cite book|author=Amit Bein|title=Ottoman Ulema, Turkish Republic: Agents of Change and Guardians of Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1xfDfgPJr8C&pg=PA141|year=2011|publisher=Stanford UP|page=141|isbn=9780804773119}}</ref>\n[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor in 1910]]\n\nThe Janissaries were a highly formidable military unit in the early years, but as Western Europe modernized its military organization technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened, or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or they might be superseded by the cavalrymen, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West.<ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who were a very powerful military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt, executed the leaders, and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into a Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  The large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: Non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the end result that they came out as one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Seljuk Empire]], were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits, and customs, and therefore the empire has been described as a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] empire.<ref name=\"iranica\">{{cite encyclopedia|first=O. |last=\u00d6zg\u00fcndenli |title=Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |edition=online |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005207/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Studies on Persianate Societies\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite book|first1 = F.|last1 = Walter|title = Music of the Ottoman court|chapter = The Departure of Turkey from the 'Persianate' Musical Sphere|chapter-url = http://www.vwb-verlag.com/Katalog/m641.html}}</ref> Intercultural marriages also played a part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents; in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously; for instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]], and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s, and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans, and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains, and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form, though it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs, and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science, and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nOver the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.

Nazir began his career as a stage actor and made his film debut with the 1952 film ''[[Marumakal]]''. He took on the stage name Prem Nazir on the sets of his second film, ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' (1952). Nazir rose to stardom during the 1950s to become one of the biggest superstars from the 1950s to his death in 1989. He is most famous for being a romantic actor. After 1985, he intentionally moved from main hero roles to character roles as he wanted to do all kinds of characters, as other artists do. \n\nNazir is noted for his critically acclaimed performances in films such as ''[[Murappennu]]'' (1965), ''[[Iruttinte Athmavu]]'' (1967), ''[[Kallichellamma]]'' (1969), ''[[Nadhi (1969 film)|Nadhi]]'' (1969), ''[[Anubhavangal Paalichakal]]'' (1971), ''[[Azhakulla Saleena]]'' (1973),  ''[[Vida Parayum Munpe]]'' (1981), ''[[Padayottam]]'' (1982), and ''[[Dhwani]]'' (1988).<ref name=\"greatestactor\"/> Nazir won the [[Kerala State Film Award (Special Jury Award)]] for his role as Madhavan Kutty in ''Vida Parayum Munpe''.

He completed his formal education from Kadinamkulam Lower Primary School, Sri Chithiravilasam School, [[SD College, Alappuzha]], and [[St. Berchmans College|SB College]], [[Changanassery]]. By the time he completed his education, he had become an experienced drama artist. It was on the sets of his second movie, ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' (1952), that Abdul Khader was renamed '''Prem Nazir''' by [[Thikkurussi Sukumaran Nair]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Entry into cinema===\n[[File:Thukalil Syed Mohamed with Prem Nazir in Perumbavoor..jpg|thumb|right|Prem Nazir with friends in Perumbavoor.]]\nPrem Nazir had his acting debut as Shylock in the play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1951), when he was a student at [[Saint Berchmans College|SB College, Changanacherry]]. He won the best actor award for this role in the play directed by Sheppard. His first film was ''[[Marumakal]]'' (1952), directed by S. K. Chari and produced by Paul Kallungal. He was credited Abdul Khader itself in this film. He got his career break with ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' (1952), his second film, made for [[Udaya Studio|K&K Combines]] (Udaya Studio) by Telugu director Mohan Rao. Prem Nazir started his career when drama was the most popular visual medium and film making at its infancy. He started acting for the [[Udaya Studio|Excel Productions]] (Udaya Studio) and most of his films were for the [[Udaya Studio|Udaya]] and [[Merryland Studio]]s.\n\n===1950s: Rise to stardom===\n\nWith the arrival of Nazir, there was a new screen personality, a new debonair actor who could be the heart throb of the youth. Prem Nazir acquired the halo of a romantic hero and a loyal following. His tear-jerkers were very popular with women audiences and soon made him a darling of the masses. He soon became the first real star of Malayalam cinema. Another factor that helped Prem Nazir's instant rise \u2013 as it had the rise of his contemporaries in other regional film industries \u2013 was the continuing reign of mythologicals and devotionals. Costumed musicals, filmed start-to-finish within the confines of a studio, contributed their own. All such films for a long period kept him before his fans, nourished his romantic image and provided him unlimited scope for rehearsing and refining his talent in playing diverse roles. Since the bulk of South Indian cinema was theatrical visually and aurally, Prem Nazir's stage background and his extraordinary command of Malayalam helped him win the hearts of his audience.\n\n===1960s, 1980s: Golden years===\nIn the late 1950s, Nazir drew attention by playing movies with themes based on social and religious injustices in the society. From 1956 to 1976, Prem Nazir rode high at the crest of a tidal wave of popularity and also gave his best to Malayalam cinema. Nazir catapulted to the row of the finest actors of India with the film ''[[Iruttinte Athmavu]]'' (1967). Playing a demented youth \u2013 Velayadhan, Prem Nazir discovered his prowess as a dramatic actor of great intensity. Many critics have evaluated this role as his masterpiece, and as one of the finest onscreen performances ever. Written by [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], the film provided Malayalam cinema with a new direction; that of the low-budget film. One could see a lot of the pre-occupations of the scenarist, who carried the touches of human relationships through all of his subsequent films whether as screenplay writer or director. In spite of its large number of studio shots and overall theatricality, the film was so culturally rich that many of the episodes would become archetypes for future Malayalam film makers dealing with family drama. It depicted the story of an imbecile (finely portrayed by Prem Nazir) in a joint family with remarkable sensitivity and seriousness of purpose.\n\nDuring his peak time, Nazir gave life to many characters and enjoyed a wide popularity among all sects of the society. He has played historical characters based on ''[[Vadakkan Pattukal]]''. ''[[Aromalunni]]'', ''[[Kannappanunni]]'', ''[[Thacholi Ambu]]'' and ''[[Padayottam]]'' are some major films in this genre. Although the actor faced criticism for playing such roles as his physique was least suited for it, he still enjoyed a huge fan following among the audiences. He was well known for his roles as Hindu deities like [[Rama]], [[Krishna]] and [[Ayyappa]]. In his movies, Nazir was well known for playing the eternal romantic hero and the good guy who would bash up the villains without remorse.\n\nEven though Nazir could not regenerate after the mid-1970s, he maintained his superstardom till the beginning of the 1980s. In 1979, 39 of his films got released; a record. He also holds the record for having acted in the most leading roles \u2013 about 700 films (with 85 heroines; another record). Another record is for the most enduring screen team along with actress [[Sheela]]. They played opposite each other in 130 movies by 1975. Although Sheela is known as the lucky mascot of Prem Nazir, his movies with other heroines like [[Jayabharathi]] and [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]] were also big successes at box office. Prem Nazir pairing with comedian [[Adoor Bhasi]] was a sure-fire laugh riot. The void left by this duo is yet to be occupied. Nazir's association with playback singer [[K. J. Yesudas]] was perfect for the audience. Even today many consider the Nazir \u2013 Yesudas combination of song sequences remains the best ever on screen. He is quite popularly described as Nithyaharithanayakan (The Evergreen Hero), which do justice to the fact that he was acting as the hero in his elder years as well. Senior Malayalam cine actress [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] has revealed that Prem Nazir was a very good singer, and had training in [[Carnatic music]].\n\n===1980s: Late career===\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, Nazir himself moved into supporting roles. He mostly played supporting roles with the then super stars [[Jayan]], [[Sukumaran]], [[Shankar Panikkar|Shankar]] and [[M. G. Soman|Soman]]. In 1981, he played a major supporting role in [[Mohan (director)|Mohan]]'s ''[[Vida Parayum Munpe]]'' that earned him the [[Kerala State Film Awards|Kerala State Special Jury Award]]. This shift, from a super romantic hero to character roles, gave him many powerful characters during the mid-1980s. His last completed film was A. T. Abu's ''[[Dhwani]]'' (1989), in which he co-starred with [[Jayaram]]. His last release was [[Priyadarshan]]'s ''[[Kadathanadan Ambadi]]'' (1990), in which he co-starred with [[Mohanlal]]. In one of his last interviews, he had expressed a desire to direct a film with [[Mammootty]] and [[Mohanlal]] in the lead.\n\n===Popular film genres===\nTwo popular film genres initiated by Prem Nazir are the C.I.D series and the Vadakkanpattu series. The former is a group of investigative films in which Nazir played James Bond like protagonists. In most of these movies Nazir teamed with [[Adoor Bhasi]], a famed comedy actor who would accompany Nazir characters in investigations. These hit mainstream popularity with the trendsetter ''Lanka Dahanam'' and are perhaps the single most popular movie series in Malayalam film history. The waves created by this movie series continue in Malayalam cinema, arguably to this day. It has inspired numerous adaptations and similar series like for example popular CBI series with Mammootty in the lead and a satirical CID series of Mohanlal-Sreenivasan team. Other inspired films are ''C.I.D Unnikrishnan'' starring [[Jayaram]] and ''C.I.D Moosa'' with [[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] in the lead.\n\nAnother popular film series starring Nazir was a series of movies based on Vadakanpaattu which are part of the traditional folklore of Kerala. These are tales of martial warriors spread over generations through folk songs. Although the series may have been initiated by Sathyan's title role in ''Thacholi Othenan'', the trend was continued long after his demise with Nazir in the lead, playing various other characters from Vadakkanpattu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/134138/malyalam-script-writer-sarangapani-dies.html |title=Malyalam script writer Sarangapani dies|work=Deccan Herald |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> Nazir later teamed with other actors like [[Jayan]], [[Shankar Panikkar|Shankar]], [[Mammootty]], [[Jayaram]] and [[Mohanlal]] in later films of this category.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Family===\nPrem Nazir was married to Habeeba Beevi and they have three daughters viz. Laila (married to Engineer Rashid of Trivandrum & settled at Calicut), Rasiya (married to Mr. Hashim, Businessman from Kannur & settled at Chennai) \u2013 both elder to [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]]. The youngest daughter is Rita (married to Doctor Sharafuddin of Punalur & settled at Muscat). [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]]'s wife Ayisha Beevi is the daughter of the eldest sister of Prem Nazir Late Suleikha Beevi. Prem Nazir's son [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]] acted in few films as well but could not succeed like his father. Third generation of Prem Nazir, [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]]'s son Shameer Khan, acted in a Malayalam film, ''[[Uppukandam Brothers Back in Action]]''.\n\nPrem Nazir's younger brother [[Prem Nawas]] (Abdul Wahab) also acted in a few films. Although he was the first in the family to begin acting in movies, he later began producing films \u2013 ''Agniputhri, Thulaavarsham, Poojakku Edukatha Pookkal, Neethi'' and ''Keni'' to name a few. [[Prem Nawas]]'s only son, Prem Kishore has also had a stint with the industry by acting in two Malayalam films \u2013 ''Vacation'' and ''Thaskaraputran''. [[Prem Nawas]] has the distinction of acting in the first ever colour film made in Malayalam \u2013 ''Kandam Vechu Kottu''.\n<ref>Shameer Khan</ref>\n\n===Philanthropic work===\nPrem Nazir was a teetotaler. He tried his hand in politics and had joined the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] but he never contested elections. He was also a social reformer and with a helping mentality to others. He helped with money to some public needs in and around Chirayinkeezhu. e.g.:- Koonthalloor School (On his memory this school is named after him Prem Nazir Memorial Government Higher Secondary School), Chirainkeezhu Hospital, Palakunnu Library etc. He donated an elephant in the Sarkara Devi Temple, Chirayinkil. Nazir also wrote a book on the film characters he played,  ''Enne Thediyethiya Kathapatrangal''. And his autobiographical book is ''Anubhangal Oarmakal''.Famous director and lyrist Sreekumarn Thambi wrote a book about his soulmate in the title ''Prem Nazir Enna Prema Ganam''.\n\n===Death===\nPrem Nazir died on 16 January 1989 at a hospital in [[Madras]]. He was being treated for [[peptic ulcer]] complicated by viral fever and [[measles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/actor-politician-prem-nazir-dies/1/323075.html |title=A sad end |work=[[India Today]] |author=Lalita Dileep |date=15 February 1989|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nPrem Nazir won his only [[Kerala State Film Award]] in 1981; He won [[Filmfare Special Award - South]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Times of India Directory and Year Book Including Who's who |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4XiAAAAMAAJ |year=1980}}</ref> for numerous films in 1976 and he won a [[Kerala State Film Award (Special Jury Award)|Special Jury Award]] for the supporting role he played in the film ''Vida Parayum Munbe''. He was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1983 by the President of India in recognition of distinguished services of a high order to the nation in his field (acting). The Prem Nazir Award was initiated in his memory, in 1992, for excellence in contributions to the [[Malayalam cinema]] Industry. He has also held the position of [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]] jury in [[33rd National Film Awards|1985]].\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nPrem Nazir is known to be the most influential and trendsetting lead actor in Malayalam. He is known for his amazing longevity in that he was active during the peak years of other iconic Malayalam superstars like [[Sathyaneshan Nadar|Sathyan]] and [[Jayan]] acting alongside them in 1960s and 1970s respectively. Nazir who began his movie career in the early 1950s, later acted alongside popular future stars like [[Shankar Panikkar|Shankar]], [[Mammootty]] & [[Mohanlal]] by the 1980s.

Nazir began his career as a stage actor and made his film debut with the 1952 film ''[[Marumakal]]''. He took on the stage name Prem Nazir on the sets of his second film, ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' (1952). Nazir rose to stardom during the 1950s to become one of the biggest superstars from the 1950s to his death in 1989. He is most famous for being a romantic actor. After 1985, he intentionally moved from main hero roles to character roles as he wanted to do all kinds of characters, as other artists do. \n\nNazir is noted for his critically acclaimed performances in films such as ''[[Murappennu]]'' (1965), ''[[Iruttinte Athmavu]]'' (1967), ''[[Kallichellamma]]'' (1969), ''[[Nadhi (1969 film)|Nadhi]]'' (1969), ''[[Anubhavangal Paalichakal]]'' (1971), ''[[Azhakulla Saleena]]'' (1973),  ''[[Vida Parayum Munpe]]'' (1981), ''[[Padayottam]]'' (1982), and ''[[Dhwani]]'' (1988).<ref name=\"greatestactor\"/> Nazir won the [[Kerala State Film Award (Special Jury Award)]] for his role as Madhavan Kutty in ''Vida Parayum Munpe''.

He completed his formal education from Kadinamkulam Lower Primary School, Sri Chithiravilasam School, [[SD College, Alappuzha]], and [[St. Berchmans College|SB College]], [[Changanassery]]. By the time he completed his education, he had become an experienced drama artist. It was on the sets of his second movie, ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' (1952), that Abdul Khader was renamed '''Prem Nazir''' by [[Thikkurussi Sukumaran Nair]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Entry into cinema===\n[[File:Thukalil Syed Mohamed with Prem Nazir in Perumbavoor..jpg|thumb|right|Prem Nazir with friends in Perumbavoor.]]\nPrem Nazir had his acting debut as Shylock in the play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1951), when he was a student at [[Saint Berchmans College|SB College, Changanacherry]]. He won the best actor award for this role in the play directed by Sheppard. His first film was ''[[Marumakal]]'' (1952), directed by S. K. Chari and produced by Paul Kallungal. He was credited Abdul Khader itself in this film. He got his career break with ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' (1952), his second film, made for [[Udaya Studio|K&K Combines]] (Udaya Studio) by Telugu director Mohan Rao. Prem Nazir started his career when drama was the most popular visual medium and film making at its infancy. He started acting for the [[Udaya Studio|Excel Productions]] (Udaya Studio) and most of his films were for the [[Udaya Studio|Udaya]] and [[Merryland Studio]]s.\n\n===1950s: Rise to stardom===\n\nWith the arrival of Nazir, there was a new screen personality, a new debonair actor who could be the heart throb of the youth. Prem Nazir acquired the halo of a romantic hero and a loyal following. His tear-jerkers were very popular with women audiences and soon made him a darling of the masses. He soon became the first real star of Malayalam cinema. Another factor that helped Prem Nazir's instant rise \u2013 as it had the rise of his contemporaries in other regional film industries \u2013 was the continuing reign of mythologicals and devotionals. Costumed musicals, filmed start-to-finish within the confines of a studio, contributed their own. All such films for a long period kept him before his fans, nourished his romantic image and provided him unlimited scope for rehearsing and refining his talent in playing diverse roles. Since the bulk of South Indian cinema was theatrical visually and aurally, Prem Nazir's stage background and his extraordinary command of Malayalam helped him win the hearts of his audience.\n\n===1960s, 1980s: Golden years===\nIn the late 1950s, Nazir drew attention by playing movies with themes based on social and religious injustices in the society. From 1956 to 1976, Prem Nazir rode high at the crest of a tidal wave of popularity and also gave his best to Malayalam cinema. Nazir catapulted to the row of the finest actors of India with the film ''[[Iruttinte Athmavu]]'' (1967). Playing a demented youth \u2013 Velayadhan, Prem Nazir discovered his prowess as a dramatic actor of great intensity. Many critics have evaluated this role as his masterpiece, and as one of the finest onscreen performances ever. Written by [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], the film provided Malayalam cinema with a new direction; that of the low-budget film. One could see a lot of the pre-occupations of the scenarist, who carried the touches of human relationships through all of his subsequent films whether as screenplay writer or director. In spite of its large number of studio shots and overall theatricality, the film was so culturally rich that many of the episodes would become archetypes for future Malayalam film makers dealing with family drama. It depicted the story of an imbecile (finely portrayed by Prem Nazir) in a joint family with remarkable sensitivity and seriousness of purpose.\n\nDuring his peak time, Nazir gave life to many characters and enjoyed a wide popularity among all sects of the society. He has played historical characters based on ''[[Vadakkan Pattukal]]''. ''[[Aromalunni]]'', ''[[Kannappanunni]]'', ''[[Thacholi Ambu]]'' and ''[[Padayottam]]'' are some major films in this genre. Although the actor faced criticism for playing such roles as his physique was least suited for it, he still enjoyed a huge fan following among the audiences. He was well known for his roles as Hindu deities like [[Rama]], [[Krishna]] and [[Ayyappa]]. In his movies, Nazir was well known for playing the eternal romantic hero and the good guy who would bash up the villains without remorse.\n\nEven though Nazir could not regenerate after the mid-1970s, he maintained his superstardom till the beginning of the 1980s. In 1979, 39 of his films got released; a record. He also holds the record for having acted in the most leading roles \u2013 about 700 films (with 85 heroines; another record). Another record is for the most enduring screen team along with actress [[Sheela]]. They played opposite each other in 130 movies by 1975. Although Sheela is known as the lucky mascot of Prem Nazir, his movies with other heroines like [[Jayabharathi]] and [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]] were also big successes at box office. Prem Nazir pairing with comedian [[Adoor Bhasi]] was a sure-fire laugh riot. The void left by this duo is yet to be occupied. Nazir's association with playback singer [[K. J. Yesudas]] was perfect for the audience. Even today many consider the Nazir \u2013 Yesudas combination of song sequences remains the best ever on screen. He is quite popularly described as Nithyaharithanayakan (The Evergreen Hero), which do justice to the fact that he was acting as the hero in his elder years as well. Senior Malayalam cine actress [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] has revealed that Prem Nazir was a very good singer, and had training in [[Carnatic music]].\n\n===1980s: Late career===\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, Nazir himself moved into supporting roles. He mostly played supporting roles with the then super stars [[Jayan]], [[Sukumaran]], [[Shankar Panikkar|Shankar]] and [[M. G. Soman|Soman]]. In 1981, he played a major supporting role in [[Mohan (director)|Mohan]]'s ''[[Vida Parayum Munpe]]'' that earned him the [[Kerala State Film Awards|Kerala State Special Jury Award]]. This shift, from a super romantic hero to character roles, gave him many powerful characters during the mid-1980s. His last completed film was A. T. Abu's ''[[Dhwani]]'' (1989), in which he co-starred with [[Jayaram]]. His last release was [[Priyadarshan]]'s ''[[Kadathanadan Ambadi]]'' (1990), in which he co-starred with [[Mohanlal]]. In one of his last interviews, he had expressed a desire to direct a film with [[Mammootty]] and [[Mohanlal]] in the lead.\n\n===Popular film genres===\nTwo popular film genres initiated by Prem Nazir are the C.I.D series and the Vadakkanpattu series. The former is a group of investigative films in which Nazir played James Bond like protagonists. In most of these movies Nazir teamed with [[Adoor Bhasi]], a famed comedy actor who would accompany Nazir characters in investigations. These hit mainstream popularity with the trendsetter ''Lanka Dahanam'' and are perhaps the single most popular movie series in Malayalam film history. The waves created by this movie series continue in Malayalam cinema, arguably to this day. It has inspired numerous adaptations and similar series like for example popular CBI series with Mammootty in the lead and a satirical CID series of Mohanlal-Sreenivasan team. Other inspired films are ''C.I.D Unnikrishnan'' starring [[Jayaram]] and ''C.I.D Moosa'' with [[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] in the lead.\n\nAnother popular film series starring Nazir was a series of movies based on Vadakanpaattu which are part of the traditional folklore of Kerala. These are tales of martial warriors spread over generations through folk songs. Although the series may have been initiated by Sathyan's title role in ''Thacholi Othenan'', the trend was continued long after his demise with Nazir in the lead, playing various other characters from Vadakkanpattu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/134138/malyalam-script-writer-sarangapani-dies.html |title=Malyalam script writer Sarangapani dies|work=Deccan Herald |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> Nazir later teamed with other actors like [[Jayan]], [[Shankar Panikkar|Shankar]], [[Mammootty]], [[Jayaram]] and [[Mohanlal]] in later films of this category.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Family===\nPrem Nazir was married to Habeeba Beevi and they have three daughters viz. Laila (married to Engineer Rashid of Trivandrum & settled at Calicut), Rasiya (married to Mr. Hashim, Businessman from Kannur & settled at Chennai) \u2013 both elder to [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]]. The youngest daughter is Rita (married to Doctor Sharafuddin of Punalur & settled at Muscat). [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]]'s wife Ayisha Beevi is the daughter of the eldest sister of Prem Nazir Late Suleikha Beevi. Prem Nazir's son [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]] acted in few films as well but could not succeed like his father. Third generation of Prem Nazir, [[Shanavas (actor)|Shanavas]]'s son Shameer Khan, acted in a Malayalam film, ''[[Uppukandam Brothers Back in Action]]''.\n\nPrem Nazir's younger brother [[Prem Nawas]] (Abdul Wahab) also acted in a few films. Although he was the first in the family to begin acting in movies, he later began producing films \u2013 ''Agniputhri, Thulaavarsham, Poojakku Edukatha Pookkal, Neethi'' and ''Keni'' to name a few. [[Prem Nawas]]'s only son, Prem Kishore has also had a stint with the industry by acting in two Malayalam films \u2013 ''Vacation'' and ''Thaskaraputran''. [[Prem Nawas]] has the distinction of acting in the first ever colour film made in Malayalam \u2013 ''Kandam Vechu Kottu''.\n<ref>Shameer Khan</ref>\n\n===Philanthropic work===\nPrem Nazir was a teetotaler. He tried his hand in politics and had joined the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] but he never contested elections. He was also a social reformer and with a helping mentality to others. He helped with money to some public needs in and around Chirayinkeezhu. e.g.:- Koonthalloor School (On his memory this school is named after him Prem Nazir Memorial Government Higher Secondary School), Chirainkeezhu Hospital, Palakunnu Library etc. He donated an elephant in the Sarkara Devi Temple, Chirayinkil. Nazir also wrote a book on the film characters he played,  ''Enne Thediyethiya Kathapatrangal''. And his autobiographical book is ''Anubhangal Oarmakal''.Famous director and lyrist Sreekumarn Thambi wrote a book about his soulmate in the title ''Prem Nazir Enna Prema Ganam''.\n\n===Death===\nPrem Nazir died on 16 January 1989 at a hospital in [[Madras]]. He was being treated for [[peptic ulcer]] complicated by viral fever and [[measles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/actor-politician-prem-nazir-dies/1/323075.html |title=A sad end |work=[[India Today]] |author=Lalita Dileep |date=15 February 1989|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nPrem Nazir won his only [[Kerala State Film Award]] in 1981; He won [[Filmfare Special Award - South]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Times of India Directory and Year Book Including Who's who |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4XiAAAAMAAJ |year=1980}}</ref> for numerous films in 1976 and he won a [[Kerala State Film Award (Special Jury Award)|Special Jury Award]] for the supporting role he played in the film ''Vida Parayum Munbe''.

The Prem Nazir Award was initiated in his memory, in 1992, for excellence in contributions to the [[Malayalam cinema]] Industry. He has also held the position of [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]] jury in [[33rd National Film Awards|1985]].\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nPrem Nazir is known to be the most influential and trendsetting lead actor in Malayalam. He is known for his amazing longevity in that he was active during the peak years of other iconic Malayalam superstars like [[Sathyaneshan Nadar|Sathyan]] and [[Jayan]] acting alongside them in 1960s and 1970s respectively. Nazir who began his movie career in the early 1950s, later acted alongside popular future stars like [[Shankar Panikkar|Shankar]], [[Mammootty]] & [[Mohanlal]] by the 1980s. He was a mainstream superstar in Malayalam cinema for over 30 years from the late 1950s to late 1980s. He also has an unofficial recognition of playing a campus character while in his late fifties. Prem Nazir has the distinction of acting with the same heroine; Sheela, in over 100 films.\n\nNazir is generally considered the ultimate romantic hero in Malayalam cinema due to his handsomeness and ease of acting in romantic roles particularly in romantic song sequences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=8629535&programId=7940855&channelId=-1073750705&BV_ID=@@@&tabId=3 |title=This memory is Evergreen-Nostalgia-Metro Manorama|publisher=manoramaonline.com |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> His song sequences combined with the lyrics of [[Vayalar Ramavarma|Vayalar]], tunes of [[G.

In humans, it is located in the [[abdominal cavity|abdomen]] behind the [[stomach]] and functions as a [[gland]]. The pancreas has both an [[endocrine]] and a digestive [[exocrine]] function. As an [[endocrine gland]], it functions mostly to regulate [[blood sugar level]]s, secreting the [[hormone]]s [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], [[somatostatin]], and [[pancreatic polypeptide]]. As a part of the digestive system, it functions as an [[exocrine gland]] secreting [[pancreatic juice]] into the [[duodenum]] through the [[pancreatic duct]]. This juice contains [[bicarbonate]], which neutralizes [[acid]] entering the duodenum from the stomach; and [[digestive enzyme]]s, which break down [[carbohydrates]], [[protein]]s, and [[lipids|fats]] in food entering the duodenum from the stomach. \n\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis, with common causes including chronic [[alcohol]] use and [[gallstone]]s. Because of its role in the regulation of blood sugar, the pancreas is also a key organ in [[diabetes mellitus]]. [[Pancreatic cancer]] can arise following [[chronic pancreatitis]] or due to other reasons, and carries a very poor prognosis, as it is often identified when it has spread to other areas of the body.\n\nThe word pancreas comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd (p\u00e2n, \u201call\u201d) & \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 (kr\u00e9as, \u201cflesh\u201d). The function of the pancreas in diabetes has been known since at least 1889, with its role in insulin production identified in 1921.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Pancreas and nearby organs.jpg|thumb|The pancreas (shown here in pink) sits behind the [[stomach]], with the body near the curvature of the [[duodenum]], and the tail stretching to touch the [[spleen]].]]\n\nThe pancreas is an organ that in humans lies in the [[abdomen]], stretching from behind the [[stomach]] to the left upper abdomen near the [[spleen]]. In adults, it is about {{convert|12|-|15|cm}} long, {{wt|en|lobulated}}, and salmon-coloured in appearance.<ref name=Grays2016>{{Cite book|title=Gray's anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice|editor=Standring, Susan|isbn=9780702052309|edition=41st|location=Philadelphia|oclc=920806541|year=2016|pp=1179\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAnatomically, the pancreas is divided into a ''head'', ''neck'', ''body'', and ''tail''. The pancreas stretches from the inner curvature of the [[duodenum]], where the head surrounds two [[blood vessel]]s: the [[superior mesenteric artery]], and [[superior mesenteric vein|vein]]. The longest part of the pancreas, the body, stretches across behind the stomach, and the tail of the pancreas ends adjacent to the [[spleen]].<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\nTwo ducts, the [[main pancreatic duct]] and a smaller [[accessory pancreatic duct]], run through the body of the pancreas, joining with the [[common bile duct]] near a small ballooning called the [[ampulla of Vater]]. Surrounded by a muscle, the [[sphincter of Oddi]], this opens into the descending part of the duodenum.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\n===Parts===\nThe head of the pancreas sits within the curvature of the duodenum, and wraps around the superior mesenteric artery and vein. To the right sits the descending part of the duodenum, and between these travel the [[superior pancreaticoduodenal artery|superior]] and [[inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery|inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries]]. Behind rests the [[inferior vena cava]], and the [[common bile duct]]. In front sits the [[peritoneum|peritoneal membrane]] and the [[transverse colon]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> A small [[uncinate process of pancreas|uncinate process]] emerges from below the head, situated behind the [[superior mesenteric vein]] and sometimes [[superior mesenteric artery|artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> \n\nThe neck of the pancreas separates the head of the pancreas, located in the curvature of the duodenum, from the body. The neck is about {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} wide, and sits in front of where the [[portal vein]] is formed. The neck lies mostly behind the pylorus of the stomach, and is covered with peritoneum. The  [[anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery]] travels in front of the neck of the pancreas.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\nThe body is the largest part of the pancreas, and mostly lies behind the stomach, tapering along its length. The peritoneum sits on top of the body of the pancreas, and the [[transverse colon]] in front of the peritoneum.<ref name=Grays2016 /> Behind the pancreas are several blood vessels, including the [[aorta]], the [[splenic vein]], and the [[left renal vein]], as well as the beginning of the [[superior mesenteric artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> Below the body of the pancreas sits some of the [[small intestine]], specifically the last part of the duodenum and the [[jejunum]] to which it connects, as well as the [[suspensory ligament of the duodenum]] which falls between these two. In front of the pancreas sits the transverse colon.{{sfn|Gray's|2008|pp=1183-1190}}\n\nThe pancreas narrows towards the tail, which sits near to the spleen.<ref name=Grays2016 /> It is usually between {{convert|1.3|-|3.5|cm|abbr=on}} long, and sits between the layers of the [[splenorenal ligament|ligament between the spleen and the left kidney]]. The [[splenic artery]] and [[splenic vein|vein]], which also passes behind the body of the pancreas, pass behind the tail of the pancreas.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\n===Blood supply===\nThe pancreas has a rich blood supply, with vessels originating as branches of both the [[coeliac artery]] and [[superior mesenteric artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> The [[splenic artery]] runs along the top of the pancreas, and supplies the left part of the body and the tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the [[greater pancreatic artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> The [[superior pancreaticoduodenal artery|superior]] and [[inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries]] run along the back and front surfaces of the head of the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum. These supply the head of the pancreas. These vessels join together ({{wt|en|anastamose}}) in the middle.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\nThe body and neck of the pancreas drain into the [[splenic vein]], which sits behind the pancreas.<ref name=Grays2016 /> The head drains into, and wraps around, the [[superior mesenteric vein|superior mesenteric]] and [[portal vein]]s, via the [[pancreaticoduodenal vein]]s.<ref name=Grays2016 /> \n\nThe pancreas drains into lymphatic vessels that travel alongside its [[artery|arteries]], and has a rich lymphatic supply.<ref name=Grays2016 /> The [[lymphatic vessel]]s of the body and tail drain into [[splenic lymph nodes]], and eventually into [[Preaortic lymph nodes|lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta]], between the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. The lymphatic vessels of the head and neck drain into intermediate lymphatic vessels around the pancreaticoduodenal, mesenteric and hepatic arteries, and from there into the lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\n===Microanatomy===\n[[File:Langerhanssche Insel.jpg|thumb|This image shows a [[pancreatic islet]] when pancreatic tissue is stained and viewed under a microscope.

Antibodies against glucagon, secreted by alpha cells, show their peripheral position. Antibodies against insulin, secreted by beta cells, show the more widespread and central position that these cells tend to have.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} ]]\nThe pancreas contains tissue with an [[endocrine]] and [[exocrine]] role, and this division is also visible when the pancreas is viewed under a microscope.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=287-291}}\n\nThe majority of pancreatic tissue has a digestive role. The cells with this role form clusters ({{lang-la|acini|[[kernel]]s}}) around small [[duct (anatomy)|ducts]], and are arranged in lobes that have thin [[fibrous tissue|fibrous]] walls. The cells of each acinus secrete inactive digestive enzymes called [[zymogen]]s into the small ''intercalated'' ducts which they surround. In each acinus, the cells are pyramid-shaped and situated around the intercalated ducts, with the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] resting on the [[basement membrane]], a large [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and a number of zymogen granules visible within the [[cytoplasm]]. The intercalated ducts drain into larger ''intralobular'' ducts within the lobule, and finally ''interlobular'' ducts. The ducts are lined by a single layer of [[columnar epithelium|column-shaped cells]]. There is more than one layer of cells as the diameter of the ducts increases.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=287-291}}\n\nThe tissues with an [[endocrine]] role within the pancreas exist as clusters of cells called [[pancreatic islets]] (also called islets of [[Paul Langerhans|Langerhans]]) that are distributed throughout the pancreas.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} Pancreatic islets contain [[alpha cell]]s, [[beta cell]]s, and [[delta cell]]s, each of which releases a different hormone. These cells have characteristic positions, with alpha cells (secreting [[glucagon]]) tending to be situated around the periphery of the islet, and beta cells (secreting [[insulin]]) more numerous and found throughout the islet.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} [[Enterochromaffin cell]]s are also scattered throughout the islets.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} Islets are composed of up to 3,000 secretory cells, and contain several small arterioles to receive blood, and venules that allow the hormones secreted by the cells to enter the [[systemic circulation]].{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}}\n\n===Variation===\nThe size of the pancreas varies considerably.<ref name=Grays2016 /> Several [[anatomical variation]]s exist, relating to the embryological development of the two [[pancreatic bud]]s. The pancreas develops from these buds on either side of the duodenum. The [[pancreatic bud|ventral bud]] rotates to lie next to the [[pancreatic bud|dorsal bud]], eventually fusing. In about 10% of adults, an [[accessory pancreatic duct]] may be present if the main duct of the dorsal bud of the pancreas does not regress; this duct opens into the [[minor duodenal papilla]].<ref name=Langmans2019 /> If the two buds themselves, each having a duct, do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a [[pancreas divisum]].

These are divided into an \"endocrine\" role, relating to the secretion of [[insulin]] and other substances within pancreatic islets that help control blood sugar levels and metabolism within the body, and an \"exocrine\" role, relating to the secretion of enzymes involved in digesting substances in the digestive tract.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=287-291}}\n\n===Blood glucose regulation===\n{{See also|Pancreatic islets}}\n[[File:Negative Feedback Gif.gif|thumb|The pancreas maintains constant blood glucose levels (shown as the waving line). When the blood glucose level is too high, the pancreas secretes insulin and when the level is too low, the pancreas secretes glucagon.]]\nCells within the pancreas help to maintain blood glucose levels ([[homeostasis]]). The cells that do this are located within the pancreatic islets that are present throughout the pancreas. When blood glucose levels are low, [[alpha cell]]s secrete [[glucagon]], which increases blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels are high [[beta cell]]s secrete [[insulin]] to decrease glucose in blood. [[Delta cell]]s in the islet also secrete [[somatostatin]] which decreases the release of insulin and glucagon.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}}\n\nGlucagon acts to increase glucose levels by promoting the [[gluconeogenesis|creation of glucose]] and the [[glycogenolysis|breakdown of glycogen]] to glucose in the liver. It also decreases the uptake of glucose in fat and muscle. Glucagon release is stimulated by low blood glucose or insulin levels, and during exercise.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2853-4}} Insulin acts to decrease blood glucose levels by facilitating uptake by cells (particularly [[skeletal muscle]]), and promoting its use in the creation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Insulin is initially created as a precursor form called [[preproinsulin]]. This is converted to [[proinsulin]] and cleaved by [[C-peptide]] to [[insulin]] which is then stored in granules in beta cells. Glucose is taken into the beta cells and degraded. The end effect of this is to cause [[depolarisation]] of the cell membrane which stimulates the release of the insulin.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2853-4}} \n\n<!--Influences-->The main factor influencing the secretion of insulin and glucagon are the levels of glucose in blood plasma.<ref name=Ganongs2019Islets>{{Cite book|title=Ganong's review of medical physiology|author1=Barrett, Kim E.|others=Barman, Susan M.,, Brooks, Heddwen L., Yuan, Jason X.-J.|isbn=9781260122404|edition=26th|location=New York|oclc=1076268769|year=2019|pp=433\u2013437|section=Regulation of Insulin Secretion; Glucagon}}</ref> Low blood sugar stimulates glucagon release, and high blood sugar stimulates insulin release.

Ducts in the pancreas (green) conduct digestive enzymes into the duodenum. This image also shows a [[pancreatic islet]], part of the endocrine pancreas, which contains cells responsible for secretion of [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]].]]\nThe pancreas plays a vital role in the [[digestive system]]. It does this by secreting a fluid that contains digestive enzymes into the [[duodenum]], the first part of the [[small intestine]] that receives food from the [[stomach]]. These enzymes help to break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats). This role is called the \"exocrine\" role of the pancreas. The cells that do this are arranged in clusters called ''[[acini]]''. Secretions into the middle of the acinus accumulate in [[intralobular ducts]], which drain to the main [[pancreatic duct]], which drains directly into the [[duodenum]]. About 1.5 - 3 liters of fluid are secreted in this manner every day.{{sfn|Gray's|2008|pp=1183-1190}}{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\nThe cells in each acinus are filled with granules containing the digestive enzymes. These are secreted in an inactive form termed [[zymogen]]s or proenzymes. When released into the duodenum, they are activated by the enzyme [[enterokinase]] present in the lining of the duodenum. The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n* [[Protease|Enzymes that break down proteins]] begin with activation of [[trypsinogen]] to [[trypsin]]. The free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen, as well as [[chymotrypsinogen]] to its active form [[chymotrypsin]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n* Enzymes secreted involved in the digestion of fats include [[pancreatic lipase|lipase]], [[phospholipase A2]], [[lysophospholipase]], and [[Sterol esterase|cholesterol esterase]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n* Enzymes that breakdown starch and other carbohydrates include [[amylase]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\nThese enzymes are secreted in a fluid rich in [[bicarbonate]]. Bicarbonate helps maintain an [[alkaline]] pH for the fluid, a pH in which most of the enzymes act most efficiently, and also helps to neutralise the stomach acids that enter the duodenum.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}} Secretion is influenced by hormones including [[secretin]], [[cholecystokinin]], and [[vasoactive intestinal peptide|VIP]], as well as [[acetylcholine]] stimulation from the [[vagus nerve]]. Secretin is released from the [[S cell]]s which form part of the lining of the duodenum in response to stimulation by gastric acid. Along with VIP, it increases the secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate. Cholecystokinin is released from [[Ito cell]]s of the lining of the duodenum and jejunum mostly in response to long chain fatty acids, and increases the effects of secretin.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}} At a cellular level, bicarbonate is secreted from the acinar cells through a sodium and bicarbonate [[cotransporter]] that acts because of membrane depolarisation caused by the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]]. Secretin and VIP act to increase the opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which leads to more membrane depolarisation and more secretion of bicarbonate.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\nA variety of mechanisms act to ensure that the digestive action of the pancreas does not act to digest pancreatic tissue itself. These include the secretion of inactive enzymes (zymogens), the secretion of the protective enzyme [[trypsin inhibitor]], which inactivates trypsin, the changes in pH that occur with bicarbonate secretion that stimulate digestion only when the pancreas is stimulated, and the fact that the low calcium within cells causes inactivation of trypsin.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\n===Additional functions===\nThe pancreas also secretes VIP and pancreatic polypeptide. [[Enterochromaffin cell]]s of the pancreas secrete the hormones [[motilin]], [[serotonin]], and [[substance P]].{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{main|Pancreatic disease}}\n\n===Inflammation===\n{{Main|Pancreatitis}}\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as [[pancreatitis]]. Pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent [[gallstone]]s or chronic alcohol use, with other common causes including traumatic damage, damage following an [[ERCP]], some medications, infections such as [[mumps]] and [[hypertriglyceridaemia|very high blood triglyceride levels]]. Acute pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central [[abdomen]], that often radiates to the back, and may be associated with nausea or vomiting. Severe pancreatitis may lead to bleeding or perforation of the pancreas resulting in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] or a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]], [[Grey Turner's sign|bruising of the flanks]] or the [[Cullen's sign|region around the belly button]]. These severe complications are often managed in an [[intensive care unit]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2018|p=837-844}}\n\nIn pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection of some of these enzymes, such as [[amylase]] and [[lipase]] in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on [[medical imaging]] such as [[ultrasound]] or a [[CT scan]], are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is often managed medically with [[analgesic|pain relief]]s, and monitoring to prevent or manage shock, and management of any identified underlying causes. This may include removal of gallstones, lowering of blood triglyceride or glucose levels, the use of [[corticosteroid]]s for [[autoimmune pancreatitis]], and the cessation of any medication triggers.{{sfn|Davidson's|2018|p=837-844}}\n\n[[Chronic pancreatitis]] refers to the development of pancreatitis over time. It shares many similar causes, with the most common being chronic alcohol use, with other causes including recurrent acute episodes and [[cystic fibrosis]]. Abdominal pain, characteristically relieved by sitting forward or drinking alcohol, is the most common symptom. When the digestive function of the pancreas is severely affected, this may lead to problems with fat digestion and the development of [[steatorrhoea]]; when the endocrine function is affected, this may lead to diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis is investigated in a similar way to acute pancreatitis. In addition to management of pain and nausea, and management of any identified causes (which may include [[alcohol cessation]]), because of the digestive role of the pancreas, [[enzyme replacement]] may be needed to prevent [[malabsorption]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2018|p=837-844}}\n\n===Cancer===\n{{Main|Pancreatic cancer}}\n[[File:Pancreatic Cancer.jpg|thumb|Pancreatic cancer, shown here, most commonly occurs as an [[adenocarcinoma]] in the head of the pancreas.

In humans, it is located in the [[abdominal cavity|abdomen]] behind the [[stomach]] and functions as a [[gland]]. The pancreas has both an [[endocrine]] and a digestive [[exocrine]] function. As an [[endocrine gland]], it functions mostly to regulate [[blood sugar level]]s, secreting the [[hormone]]s [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], [[somatostatin]], and [[pancreatic polypeptide]]. As a part of the digestive system, it functions as an [[exocrine gland]] secreting [[pancreatic juice]] into the [[duodenum]] through the [[pancreatic duct]]. This juice contains [[bicarbonate]], which neutralizes [[acid]] entering the duodenum from the stomach; and [[digestive enzyme]]s, which break down [[carbohydrates]], [[protein]]s, and [[lipids|fats]] in food entering the duodenum from the stomach. \n\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis, with common causes including chronic [[alcohol]] use and [[gallstone]]s. Because of its role in the regulation of blood sugar, the pancreas is also a key organ in [[diabetes mellitus]]. [[Pancreatic cancer]] can arise following [[chronic pancreatitis]] or due to other reasons, and carries a very poor prognosis, as it is often identified when it has spread to other areas of the body.\n\nThe word pancreas comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd (p\u00e2n, \u201call\u201d) & \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 (kr\u00e9as, \u201cflesh\u201d). The function of the pancreas in diabetes has been known since at least 1889, with its role in insulin production identified in 1921.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Pancreas and nearby organs.jpg|thumb|The pancreas (shown here in pink) sits behind the [[stomach]], with the body near the curvature of the [[duodenum]], and the tail stretching to touch the [[spleen]].]]\n\nThe pancreas is an organ that in humans lies in the [[abdomen]], stretching from behind the [[stomach]] to the left upper abdomen near the [[spleen]]. In adults, it is about {{convert|12|-|15|cm}} long, {{wt|en|lobulated}}, and salmon-coloured in appearance.<ref name=Grays2016>{{Cite book|title=Gray's anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice|editor=Standring, Susan|isbn=9780702052309|edition=41st|location=Philadelphia|oclc=920806541|year=2016|pp=1179\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAnatomically, the pancreas is divided into a ''head'', ''neck'', ''body'', and ''tail''. The pancreas stretches from the inner curvature of the [[duodenum]], where the head surrounds two [[blood vessel]]s: the [[superior mesenteric artery]], and [[superior mesenteric vein|vein]]. The longest part of the pancreas, the body, stretches across behind the stomach, and the tail of the pancreas ends adjacent to the [[spleen]].<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\nTwo ducts, the [[main pancreatic duct]] and a smaller [[accessory pancreatic duct]], run through the body of the pancreas, joining with the [[common bile duct]] near a small ballooning called the [[ampulla of Vater]]. Surrounded by a muscle, the [[sphincter of Oddi]], this opens into the descending part of the duodenum.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\n===Parts===\nThe head of the pancreas sits within the curvature of the duodenum, and wraps around the superior mesenteric artery and vein. To the right sits the descending part of the duodenum, and between these travel the [[superior pancreaticoduodenal artery|superior]] and [[inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery|inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries]]. Behind rests the [[inferior vena cava]], and the [[common bile duct]]. In front sits the [[peritoneum|peritoneal membrane]] and the [[transverse colon]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> A small [[uncinate process of pancreas|uncinate process]] emerges from below the head, situated behind the [[superior mesenteric vein]] and sometimes [[superior mesenteric artery|artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> \n\nThe neck of the pancreas separates the head of the pancreas, located in the curvature of the duodenum, from the body. The neck is about {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} wide, and sits in front of where the [[portal vein]] is formed. The neck lies mostly behind the pylorus of the stomach, and is covered with peritoneum. The  [[anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery]] travels in front of the neck of the pancreas.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\nThe body is the largest part of the pancreas, and mostly lies behind the stomach, tapering along its length. The peritoneum sits on top of the body of the pancreas, and the [[transverse colon]] in front of the peritoneum.<ref name=Grays2016 /> Behind the pancreas are several blood vessels, including the [[aorta]], the [[splenic vein]], and the [[left renal vein]], as well as the beginning of the [[superior mesenteric artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> Below the body of the pancreas sits some of the [[small intestine]], specifically the last part of the duodenum and the [[jejunum]] to which it connects, as well as the [[suspensory ligament of the duodenum]] which falls between these two. In front of the pancreas sits the transverse colon.{{sfn|Gray's|2008|pp=1183-1190}}\n\nThe pancreas narrows towards the tail, which sits near to the spleen.<ref name=Grays2016 /> It is usually between {{convert|1.3|-|3.5|cm|abbr=on}} long, and sits between the layers of the [[splenorenal ligament|ligament between the spleen and the left kidney]]. The [[splenic artery]] and [[splenic vein|vein]], which also passes behind the body of the pancreas, pass behind the tail of the pancreas.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\n===Blood supply===\nThe pancreas has a rich blood supply, with vessels originating as branches of both the [[coeliac artery]] and [[superior mesenteric artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> The [[splenic artery]] runs along the top of the pancreas, and supplies the left part of the body and the tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the [[greater pancreatic artery]].<ref name=Grays2016 /> The [[superior pancreaticoduodenal artery|superior]] and [[inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries]] run along the back and front surfaces of the head of the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum. These supply the head of the pancreas. These vessels join together ({{wt|en|anastamose}}) in the middle.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\nThe body and neck of the pancreas drain into the [[splenic vein]], which sits behind the pancreas.<ref name=Grays2016 /> The head drains into, and wraps around, the [[superior mesenteric vein|superior mesenteric]] and [[portal vein]]s, via the [[pancreaticoduodenal vein]]s.<ref name=Grays2016 /> \n\nThe pancreas drains into lymphatic vessels that travel alongside its [[artery|arteries]], and has a rich lymphatic supply.<ref name=Grays2016 /> The [[lymphatic vessel]]s of the body and tail drain into [[splenic lymph nodes]], and eventually into [[Preaortic lymph nodes|lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta]], between the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. The lymphatic vessels of the head and neck drain into intermediate lymphatic vessels around the pancreaticoduodenal, mesenteric and hepatic arteries, and from there into the lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta.<ref name=Grays2016 />\n\n===Microanatomy===\n[[File:Langerhanssche Insel.jpg|thumb|This image shows a [[pancreatic islet]] when pancreatic tissue is stained and viewed under a microscope.

The cells with this role form clusters ({{lang-la|acini|[[kernel]]s}}) around small [[duct (anatomy)|ducts]], and are arranged in lobes that have thin [[fibrous tissue|fibrous]] walls. The cells of each acinus secrete inactive digestive enzymes called [[zymogen]]s into the small ''intercalated'' ducts which they surround. In each acinus, the cells are pyramid-shaped and situated around the intercalated ducts, with the [[nuclei]] resting on the [[basement membrane]], a large [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and a number of zymogen granules visible within the [[cytoplasm]]. The intercalated ducts drain into larger ''intralobular'' ducts within the lobule, and finally ''interlobular'' ducts. The ducts are lined by a single layer of [[columnar epithelium|column-shaped cells]]. There is more than one layer of cells as the diameter of the ducts increases.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=287-291}}\n\nThe tissues with an [[endocrine]] role within the pancreas exist as clusters of cells called [[pancreatic islets]] (also called islets of [[Paul Langerhans|Langerhans]]) that are distributed throughout the pancreas.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} Pancreatic islets contain [[alpha cell]]s, [[beta cell]]s, and [[delta cell]]s, each of which releases a different hormone. These cells have characteristic positions, with alpha cells (secreting [[glucagon]]) tending to be situated around the periphery of the islet, and beta cells (secreting [[insulin]]) more numerous and found throughout the islet.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} [[Enterochromaffin cell]]s are also scattered throughout the islets.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}} Islets are composed of up to 3,000 secretory cells, and contain several small arterioles to receive blood, and venules that allow the hormones secreted by the cells to enter the [[systemic circulation]].{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}}\n\n===Variation===\nThe size of the pancreas varies considerably.<ref name=Grays2016 /> Several [[anatomical variation]]s exist, relating to the embryological development of the two [[pancreatic bud]]s. The pancreas develops from these buds on either side of the duodenum. The [[pancreatic bud|ventral bud]] rotates to lie next to the [[pancreatic bud|dorsal bud]], eventually fusing. In about 10% of adults, an [[accessory pancreatic duct]] may be present if the main duct of the dorsal bud of the pancreas does not regress; this duct opens into the [[minor duodenal papilla]].<ref name=Langmans2019 /> If the two buds themselves, each having a duct, do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a [[pancreas divisum]].

When the blood glucose level is too high, the pancreas secretes insulin and when the level is too low, the pancreas secretes glucagon.]]\nCells within the pancreas help to maintain blood glucose levels ([[homeostasis]]). The cells that do this are located within the pancreatic islets that are present throughout the pancreas. When blood glucose levels are low, [[alpha cell]]s secrete [[glucagon]], which increases blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels are high [[beta cell]]s secrete [[insulin]] to decrease glucose in blood. [[Delta cell]]s in the islet also secrete [[somatostatin]] which decreases the release of insulin and glucagon.{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}}\n\nGlucagon acts to increase glucose levels by promoting the [[gluconeogenesis|creation of glucose]] and the [[glycogenolysis|breakdown of glycogen]] to glucose in the liver. It also decreases the uptake of glucose in fat and muscle. Glucagon release is stimulated by low blood glucose or insulin levels, and during exercise.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2853-4}} Insulin acts to decrease blood glucose levels by facilitating uptake by cells (particularly [[skeletal muscle]]), and promoting its use in the creation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Insulin is initially created as a precursor form called [[preproinsulin]]. This is converted to [[proinsulin]] and cleaved by [[C-peptide]] to [[insulin]] which is then stored in granules in beta cells. Glucose is taken into the beta cells and degraded. The end effect of this is to cause [[depolarisation]] of the cell membrane which stimulates the release of the insulin.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2853-4}} \n\n<!--Influences-->The main factor influencing the secretion of insulin and glucagon are the levels of glucose in blood plasma.<ref name=Ganongs2019Islets>{{Cite book|title=Ganong's review of medical physiology|author1=Barrett, Kim E.|others=Barman, Susan M.,, Brooks, Heddwen L., Yuan, Jason X.-J.|isbn=9781260122404|edition=26th|location=New York|oclc=1076268769|year=2019|pp=433\u2013437|section=Regulation of Insulin Secretion; Glucagon}}</ref> Low blood sugar stimulates glucagon release, and high blood sugar stimulates insulin release.

It does this by secreting a fluid that contains digestive enzymes into the [[duodenum]], the first part of the [[small intestine]] that receives food from the [[stomach]].

About 1.5 - 3 liters of fluid are secreted in this manner every day.{{sfn|Gray's|2008|pp=1183-1190}}{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\nThe cells in each acinus are filled with granules containing the digestive enzymes. These are secreted in an inactive form termed [[zymogen]]s or proenzymes. When released into the duodenum, they are activated by the enzyme [[enterokinase]] present in the lining of the duodenum. The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n* [[Protease|Enzymes that break down proteins]] begin with activation of [[trypsinogen]] to [[trypsin]]. The free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen, as well as [[chymotrypsinogen]] to its active form [[chymotrypsin]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n* Enzymes secreted involved in the digestion of fats include [[pancreatic lipase|lipase]], [[phospholipase A2]], [[lysophospholipase]], and [[Sterol esterase|cholesterol esterase]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n* Enzymes that breakdown starch and other carbohydrates include [[amylase]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\nThese enzymes are secreted in a fluid rich in [[bicarbonate]]. Bicarbonate helps maintain an [[alkaline]] pH for the fluid, a pH in which most of the enzymes act most efficiently, and also helps to neutralise the stomach acids that enter the duodenum.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}} Secretion is influenced by hormones including [[secretin]], [[cholecystokinin]], and [[vasoactive intestinal peptide|VIP]], as well as [[acetylcholine]] stimulation from the [[vagus nerve]]. Secretin is released from the [[S cell]]s which form part of the lining of the duodenum in response to stimulation by gastric acid. Along with VIP, it increases the secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate. Cholecystokinin is released from [[Ito cell]]s of the lining of the duodenum and jejunum mostly in response to long chain fatty acids, and increases the effects of secretin.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}} At a cellular level, bicarbonate is secreted from the acinar cells through a sodium and bicarbonate [[cotransporter]] that acts because of membrane depolarisation caused by the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]]. Secretin and VIP act to increase the opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which leads to more membrane depolarisation and more secretion of bicarbonate.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\nA variety of mechanisms act to ensure that the digestive action of the pancreas does not act to digest pancreatic tissue itself. These include the secretion of inactive enzymes (zymogens), the secretion of the protective enzyme [[trypsin inhibitor]], which inactivates trypsin, the changes in pH that occur with bicarbonate secretion that stimulate digestion only when the pancreas is stimulated, and the fact that the low calcium within cells causes inactivation of trypsin.{{sfn|Harrison's|2015|pp=2437-8}}\n\n===Additional functions===\nThe pancreas also secretes VIP and pancreatic polypeptide. [[Enterochromaffin cell]]s of the pancreas secrete the hormones [[motilin]], [[serotonin]], and [[substance P]].{{sfn|Wheater's Histology|2013|pp=332-333}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{main|Pancreatic disease}}\n\n===Inflammation===\n{{Main|Pancreatitis}}\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as [[pancreatitis]]. Pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent [[gallstone]]s or chronic alcohol use, with other common causes including traumatic damage, damage following an [[ERCP]], some medications, infections such as [[mumps]] and [[hypertriglyceridaemia|very high blood triglyceride levels]]. Acute pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central [[abdomen]], that often radiates to the back, and may be associated with nausea or vomiting. Severe pancreatitis may lead to bleeding or perforation of the pancreas resulting in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] or a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]], [[Grey Turner's sign|bruising of the flanks]] or the [[Cullen's sign|region around the belly button]]. These severe complications are often managed in an [[intensive care unit]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2018|p=837-844}}\n\nIn pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection of some of these enzymes, such as [[amylase]] and [[lipase]] in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on [[medical imaging]] such as [[ultrasound]] or a [[CT scan]], are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is often managed medically with [[analgesic|pain relief]]s, and monitoring to prevent or manage shock, and management of any identified underlying causes. This may include removal of gallstones, lowering of blood triglyceride or glucose levels, the use of [[corticosteroid]]s for [[autoimmune pancreatitis]], and the cessation of any medication triggers.{{sfn|Davidson's|2018|p=837-844}}\n\n[[Chronic pancreatitis]] refers to the development of pancreatitis over time. It shares many similar causes, with the most common being chronic alcohol use, with other causes including recurrent acute episodes and [[cystic fibrosis]]. Abdominal pain, characteristically relieved by sitting forward or drinking alcohol, is the most common symptom. When the digestive function of the pancreas is severely affected, this may lead to problems with fat digestion and the development of [[steatorrhoea]]; when the endocrine function is affected, this may lead to diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis is investigated in a similar way to acute pancreatitis. In addition to management of pain and nausea, and management of any identified causes (which may include [[alcohol cessation]]), because of the digestive role of the pancreas, [[enzyme replacement]] may be needed to prevent [[malabsorption]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2018|p=837-844}}\n\n===Cancer===\n{{Main|Pancreatic cancer}}\n[[File:Pancreatic Cancer.jpg|thumb|Pancreatic cancer, shown here, most commonly occurs as an [[adenocarcinoma]] in the head of the pancreas.

He was the co-founder of the [[Dynamic Graphics Project]], and is the founder of the Knowledge Media Design Institute (KMDI) and the Technologies for Aging Gracefully Lab (TAGlab). He is the author of ''Computers and Society: Modern Perspectives'', published by Oxford University Press in 2019.\n\n==Summary of research interests==\n\nDr. Baecker is an expert in [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI), [[user interface]] (UI) design, software visualization, multimedia, computer-supported cooperative work and learning, and entrepreneurship in the software industry.<ref>Ron Baecker. 18 November 2015. \"Ph.D., Computer Science, Department of Electrical Engineering, M.I.T 1969\". University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref>\n\nFrom 1966 through 1969, Dr. Baecker developed the first comprehensive conceptual framework for computer animation on Genesys, a foundational computer animation system that he himself designed and built at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This work helped launch the field of computer animation. He also developed [[Smalltalk]], a novel computer animation system for children, at the [[Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]] in 1974 and worked on interactive computer graphics and guided the realization and testing of the animated icon from 1988 through 1990.<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\nContinuing on his work on software visualization, between 1973 and 1981, he produced the film Sorting Out Sorting \u2013 a seminal piece elucidating the potential of computer animation and behavior that propelled the field of algorithm animation. In addition to the film, Dr. Baecker and his colleagues presented a systematic and comprehensive new approach to enhancing the presentation of computer program source using graphic design principles (1982\u201388), formulated conceptual frameworks for software visualization (1981\u201392), and constructed powerful yet unobtrusive systems for the visualization of programs in particular programming languages, and then applied it to the LOGO system(1988\u201394).<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\nFrom the 1990s through the 2010s, he created two innovative collaborative multimedia technologies. His team was the first group to employ hierarchically structured multimedia for the interactive authoring of digital video and other dynamic visual presentations, and the first to apply such a system to the creation of materials for software support and training. Additionally, his team worked on the use of highly interactive webcasting with structured rich media archives as the [http://epresence.tv/ ePresence Interactive Media] environment for collaborative learning.<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Baecker founded TAGlab to research the design of technologies for aging gracefully and was a founding researcher in [http://agewell-nce.ca/ AGE-WELL], Canada's Technology and Aging research network.<ref>{{Cite web|title = AGE-WELL: Ronald Baecker {{!}} |url = http://agewell-nce.ca/archives/dt_portfolios/dr-ronald-baecker|website = agewell-nce.ca|accessdate = 2019-05-02}}</ref> This research is primarily focused on increasing computer literacy among seniors and using technology to help individuals work better and be safer. His current research has been centered on envisioning, designing, building, and evaluating technological aids intended for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, amnesia, vision loss, and stroke, and the natural consequences of aging.\n\nSystems built include the development of online social gaming environments for seniors, online brain fitness environments, mobile phone software to help individuals with communication challenges to speak, e-book software to help people with visual or motor impairments to read, digital communicating picture frame technology to help connect individuals who are isolated and lonely to family and friends, and a thanatosensitive design of web portals to support individuals who are grieving.<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDr. Baecker was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on October 7, 1942. When he was four, his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His scientific career got off to an early start, when, in April 1958, he was awarded third prize in the American Chemical Society Chemistry test (Pittsburgh Section). He went on to win several other science honors while at Taylor Allderdice High School, including attending the Westinghouse Science Honors Institute (October 1958 to April 1959), and the Sun-Telegraph, Pittsburgh and Allegheny Count High Schools Scholastic Award in Science (1959).\n\nIn 1960, he began work as a summer research assistant at [[Koppers Company]] Research Labs. He was awarded a B.S. degree in Physics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1963 and received an M.S. degree in the then burgeoning field of Electrical Engineering, again from MIT in 1964. At the end of 1964, he traveled to the University of Heidelberg in Germany to further his studies in applied mathematics where he stayed until July 1965. He returned to his alma mater to study Computer Science at MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and received his [http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-061.pdf Ph.D.] in June 1969.<ref>Ron Baecker. 18 Nov. 2015. \"Ph.D., Computer Science, Department of Electrical Engineering, M.I.T 1969\". University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n=== Entrepreneurial and Management Experience ===\nDr. Baecker has started five software companies, three of which he led as founding CEO. \nHis first start-up, [[Human Computing Resources]], later renamed to HCR Corporation, was founded in 1976 with an investment of $11,000 and eventually became a multi-million dollar world-class UNIX systems software firm. In 1990, it was sold the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO) and continued as SCO Canada until early 1996.\n\nHis second venture, Expresto Software Corporation attempted to commercialize video authoring and publishing technology; in 2002, it was sold to a shareholder. Following the dissolution of Expresto, Dr. Baecker originated the concept and led the development for a successful proposal for an NSERC Research Network Grant entitled the Network for Effective Collaboration Through Advanced Research (NECTAR).\n\nBetween 1995 and 1998, Dr. Baecker founded the Knowledge Media Design Institute at the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. This was the first institute at U of T to address interdisciplinary issues within the production, creation, and distribution of knowledge media.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Knowledge Media Design Institute|url = https://ischool.utoronto.ca/research/institutes-labs/knowledge-media-design-institute-kmdi/|website = www.ischool.utoronto.ca|accessdate = 2019-05-02}}</ref> In 2002, KMDI sponsored the development of a knowledge media design collaborative graduate degree program. He continues to serve as the Institute's Chief Scientist to provide intellectual leadership.\n\nBetween 2008 through 2011, he spun out Captual Technologies Inc. to develop and market ePresence, the first official open source software release from the University of Toronto, worldwide. In 2011, the company was sold to Canadian courseware management solutions firm [[Desire2Learn]].\n\nFollowing his project to develop context-aware mobile communications apps to aid speaking by adults with communication disorders such as caused by strokes, or children with learning and communication challenges such as autism spectrum disorder, Dr. Baecker assisted the start-up of MyVoice Inc. to commercialize an extraordinary context-aware mobile speech aid app. The company was doing well, until it was abandoned by its CEO in 2016.\n\nSince 2010, Dr. Baecker has been transforming his work on aids for socially isolated and lonely seniors to keep them connected to family and friends into Famili.net Communications, which is currently commercializing a novel tablet-based communications tool for older adults.\n\n=== Teaching Experience ===\nDr. Baecker is an active lecturer, and consultant on human-computer interaction and user interface design, user support, software visualization, multimedia, computer-supported cooperative work and learning, the Internet, entrepreneurship and strategic planning in the software industry, and the role of information technology in business.\n\nSince 1972, Dr. Baecker has developed original courses in interactive computer graphics, human-computer interaction, user interface and computational media and knowledge media design, computer-supported cooperative work, computer literacy, and [[software entrepreneurship]]. In 1973, he co-founded the [[Dynamic Graphics Project]] at the University of Toronto, creating the first Canadian university group studying HCI and computer graphics. In addition, in 1990, he developed the first undergraduate human-computer interaction specialization within computer science at U of T.\n\nAdditionally, in 2004, he founded the TAGlab to support research and development of technologies to aid cognition, communication, and social interaction among seniors.

This work helped launch the field of computer animation. He also developed [[Smalltalk]], a novel computer animation system for children, at the [[Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]] in 1974 and worked on interactive computer graphics and guided the realization and testing of the animated icon from 1988 through 1990.<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\nContinuing on his work on software visualization, between 1973 and 1981, he produced the film Sorting Out Sorting \u2013 a seminal piece elucidating the potential of computer animation and behavior that propelled the field of algorithm animation. In addition to the film, Dr. Baecker and his colleagues presented a systematic and comprehensive new approach to enhancing the presentation of computer program source using graphic design principles (1982\u201388), formulated conceptual frameworks for software visualization (1981\u201392), and constructed powerful yet unobtrusive systems for the visualization of programs in particular programming languages, and then applied it to the LOGO system(1988\u201394).<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\nFrom the 1990s through the 2010s, he created two innovative collaborative multimedia technologies. His team was the first group to employ hierarchically structured multimedia for the interactive authoring of digital video and other dynamic visual presentations, and the first to apply such a system to the creation of materials for software support and training. Additionally, his team worked on the use of highly interactive webcasting with structured rich media archives as the [http://epresence.tv/ ePresence Interactive Media] environment for collaborative learning.<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Baecker founded TAGlab to research the design of technologies for aging gracefully and was a founding researcher in [http://agewell-nce.ca/ AGE-WELL], Canada's Technology and Aging research network.<ref>{{Cite web|title = AGE-WELL: Ronald Baecker {{!}} |url = http://agewell-nce.ca/archives/dt_portfolios/dr-ronald-baecker|website = agewell-nce.ca|accessdate = 2019-05-02}}</ref> This research is primarily focused on increasing computer literacy among seniors and using technology to help individuals work better and be safer. His current research has been centered on envisioning, designing, building, and evaluating technological aids intended for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, amnesia, vision loss, and stroke, and the natural consequences of aging.\n\nSystems built include the development of online social gaming environments for seniors, online brain fitness environments, mobile phone software to help individuals with communication challenges to speak, e-book software to help people with visual or motor impairments to read, digital communicating picture frame technology to help connect individuals who are isolated and lonely to family and friends, and a thanatosensitive design of web portals to support individuals who are grieving.<ref>Ron Baecker. September 2018. \"Curriculum Vitae\".</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDr. Baecker was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on October 7, 1942. When he was four, his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His scientific career got off to an early start, when, in April 1958, he was awarded third prize in the American Chemical Society Chemistry test (Pittsburgh Section). He went on to win several other science honors while at Taylor Allderdice High School, including attending the Westinghouse Science Honors Institute (October 1958 to April 1959), and the Sun-Telegraph, Pittsburgh and Allegheny Count High Schools Scholastic Award in Science (1959).\n\nIn 1960, he began work as a summer research assistant at [[Koppers Company]] Research Labs. He was awarded a B.S. degree in Physics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1963 and received an M.S. degree in the then burgeoning field of Electrical Engineering, again from MIT in 1964. At the end of 1964, he traveled to the University of Heidelberg in Germany to further his studies in applied mathematics where he stayed until July 1965. He returned to his alma mater to study Computer Science at MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and received his [http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-061.pdf Ph.D.] in June 1969.<ref>Ron Baecker. 18 Nov. 2015. \"Ph.D., Computer Science, Department of Electrical Engineering, M.I.T 1969\". University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n=== Entrepreneurial and Management Experience ===\nDr. Baecker has started five software companies, three of which he led as founding CEO. \nHis first start-up, HCR (formerly Human Computing Resources), was founded in 1976 with an investment of $11,000 and eventually became a multi-million dollar world-class UNIX systems software firm. In 1990, it was sold the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO) and continued as SCO Canada until early 1996.\n\nHis second venture, Expresto Software Corporation attempted to commercialize video authoring and publishing technology; in 2002, it was sold to a shareholder. Following the dissolution of Expresto, Dr. Baecker originated the concept and led the development for a successful proposal for an NSERC Research Network Grant entitled the Network for Effective Collaboration Through Advanced Research (NECTAR).\n\nBetween 1995 and 1998, Dr. Baecker founded the Knowledge Media Design Institute at the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. This was the first institute at U of T to address interdisciplinary issues within the production, creation, and distribution of knowledge media.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Knowledge Media Design Institute|url = https://ischool.utoronto.ca/research/institutes-labs/knowledge-media-design-institute-kmdi/|website = www.ischool.utoronto.ca|accessdate = 2019-05-02}}</ref> In 2002, KMDI sponsored the development of a knowledge media design collaborative graduate degree program. He continues to serve as the Institute's Chief Scientist to provide intellectual leadership.\n\nBetween 2008 through 2011, he spun out Captual Technologies Inc. to develop and market ePresence, the first official open source software release from the University of Toronto, worldwide. In 2011, the company was sold to Canadian courseware management solutions firm [[Desire2Learn]].\n\nFollowing his project to develop context-aware mobile communications apps to aid speaking by adults with communication disorders such as caused by strokes, or children with learning and communication challenges such as autism spectrum disorder, Dr. Baecker assisted the start-up of MyVoice Inc. to commercialize an extraordinary context-aware mobile speech aid app. The company was doing well, until it was abandoned by its CEO in 2016.\n\nSince 2010, Dr. Baecker has been transforming his work on aids for socially isolated and lonely seniors to keep them connected to family and friends into Famili.net Communications, which is currently commercializing a novel tablet-based communications tool for older adults.\n\n=== Teaching Experience ===\nDr. Baecker is an active lecturer, and consultant on human-computer interaction and user interface design, user support, software visualization, multimedia, computer-supported cooperative work and learning, the Internet, entrepreneurship and strategic planning in the software industry, and the role of information technology in business.\n\nSince 1972, Dr. Baecker has developed original courses in interactive computer graphics, human-computer interaction, user interface and computational media and knowledge media design, computer-supported cooperative work, computer literacy, and [[software entrepreneurship]]. In 1973, he co-founded the [[Dynamic Graphics Project]] at the University of Toronto, creating the first Canadian university group studying HCI and computer graphics.

takeoff and landing.\n\nIt was announced at the 51st International [[Paris Air Show]] - 2015. In essence, it is a modification of the [[Antonov An-70|An-70]] with four turbojet engines manufactured by JSC [[Motor Sich]] - D-436-148FM or the latest AI-28 instead of turbofan [[Progress D-27|D-27]]. Aircraft equipment and engines from other manufacturers are possible.\n\nAccording to the purpose, the aircraft occupies a niche between the average transport aircraft [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J-30]] and the heavy [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17A]].\n\n[[Maximum takeoff weight]] \u2014 140 tons.\n\n[[Payload]] \u2014 40 tons.\n\nSpecifications will allow operation on soil [[runway]]s up to 915 m (3,000 feet) in length.\n\nFuel consumption is estimated at 4,600&nbsp;kg/h.\n\n== Videos ==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2qUO_kh_DU&t=22s Model An-188 at Eurasia-2018

{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are relatively rare. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. One approach is to have instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]''. The opposite approach is to be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment. It is also possible to have a compromise with some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]].\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

S. Bach]]\n", "text_old": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are relatively rare. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. One approach is to have instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]''. The opposite approach is to be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment. It is also possible to have a compromise with some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]].\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

Persian still held its status, despite the spread of Urdu, well into the early years of the [[British India|British]] rule in South Asia.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Literature|Pakistan}}\n*[[Pakistani poetry]]\n*[[Postcolonial literature]]\n*[[Books and Publishing in Pakistan]]\n*[[Progressive Writers' Movement]]\n*[[Saraiki literature]]\n*[[Urdu literature]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060324122700/http://www.the-south-asian.com/Nov2004/Pakistani_literature_short_story_1.htm Kamran, Gilani, 2004, ''Pakistan Literature: Evolution & trends'']\n*''Pakistani Literature: The Contemporary English Writers'' edited by [[Alamgir Hashmi]] (New York: World University Service, 1978; Islamabad: Gulmohar Press, 1987) (2nd ed.). {{ISBN|0-00-500408-X}} (OCLC #19328427; LC Card #87931006)\n*''A Dragonfly in the Sun: An Anthology of Pakistani Writing in English'', edited by [[Muneeza Shamsie]] (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 1997). {{ISBN|0-19-577784-0}}\n*''Leaving Home: Towards a New Millennium: A Collection of English Prose by Pakistani Writers'', edited by [[Muneeza Shamsie]] (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2001). {{ISBN|0-19-579529-6}}\n*''Post Independence Voices in South Asian Writings'', edited by [[Alamgir Hashmi]], [[Malashri Lal]] & [[Victor Ramraj]] (Islamabad: Alhamra, 2001). {{ISBN|969-516-093-X}}\n*Rahman, Tariq. 1991.

Lundgren led a cult in Kirtland where he and several of his followers murdered the Avery family, fellow members of his cult, for which he was convicted and sentenced to [[death penalty|death]].\n\nLundgren was [[executed]] in 2006.\n\n== Background ==\nLundgren was born on May 3, 1950, in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri, and grew up as a member of the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church).  According to his allegations (supported by some of his former neighbors), he was severely [[child abuse|abused]] as a child, particularly by his father, and his mother reportedly did not defend him.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}  Lundgren was, by most accounts, a [[loner]] when he was in middle and high school. He became an expert [[hunting|hunter]] when he began to spend time with his father as a teenager. The pair would go on hunting trips, and Lundgren became a gun expert, learning shooting and maintenance techniques.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nLundgren enrolled at [[Central Missouri State University]]<ref name=Sasse/> and he spent time at a house that was specially built for RLDS youth. While at the house, he became friends with Alice Keeler and Keith Johnson. Keeler, who had also been abused by her father, quickly bonded with Lundgren, and the two became lovers. The couple married in 1970 and Lundgren enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], and on December 2, 1970, the couple's first child, a boy, was born.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By 1974, Keeler was [[pregnant]] for the second time. Prior to receiving an [[honorable discharge]] from the U.S. Navy at the end of his first term, Lundgren sought an early release from his term of duty by arguing that his presence was necessary for the sustenance of his family. He was denied an early release for reasons that were non-necessary according to military recommendations. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy days before his four-year enlistment was completed. His second son was born soon afterward.\n\nLundgren and his new family settled in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California after he was discharged from the Navy, but once economic problems began to set in, the Lundgrens moved back to Missouri. In 1979, Keeler gave birth to a third child, a daughter. People close to the couple claim that Lundgren seemed frustrated by the family's money problems and was generally tired of his wife, and he allegedly became abusive after the birth of his daughter. According to hospital records, his wife was hospitalized for a ruptured [[spleen]], which may have been caused by Lundgren pushing her into a closet door handle. In 1980, the couple had their fourth child, another boy.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren was dismissed as a lay minister by the RLDS Church.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\n== Religious activities ==\nWhile Lundgren was living in a church-owned home, located next to the [[Kirtland Temple]], on Chillicothe Road, in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], Ohio, he volunteered as a tour guide of the historic [[Kirtland Temple]], for the RLDS Church. He began to teach the concept of \"dividing the word\", known as \"chiastic interpretation\" or \"[[chiasmus]]\", to interpret scriptures. Lundgren falsely claimed to have created chiastic interpretation. The foundation was that in everything created by God, the right side is a mirror image and, therefore, scripture had to be interpreted using that same method. He cited the Kirtland Temple as an example because the right side was a mirror image of the left side. To apply this concept to scripture, one takes a sentence from scripture; if the sentences before and after are consistent, the center sentence is the \"truth\"; when the sentences before and after conflict, the center sentence is a lie. His teaching of scriptural interpretations attracted his followers. Lundgren claimed that he moved to Ohio from Missouri because the word, <small>\"OHIO\"</small> is \"chiastic\". About 1987, Lundgren was asked to leave the church-owned house and his job as tour guide was terminated due to suspicions of theft.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren and his family moved to a rented farm house, located at 8671 Chardon Road on [[U.S. Route 6]] (aka: Euclid-Chardon Road), east of Ohio State Route #306. Some of the followers knew Lundgren in Missouri while others were attracted to Lundgren when they were exposed to his teachings when he was working as a Kirtland Temple tour guide. At that time, some followers started to move into his home. Those who moved into the house were Kevin Currie, Richard Brand, Greg Winship, Sharon Bluntschly, Daniel Kraft, and Debbie Olivarez. Ronald and Susan Luff; Dennis and Tonya Patrick; and Dennis and Cheryl Avery maintained their own residences. There were others whose names were not made public because they were not significant to the criminal investigation (conspiracy to deprive civil rights, the Kirtland Temple takeover, and multiple homicide of the Avery family).  While Lundgren was living at the farm house, Lundgren's teachings continued and he began to practice methods of \"mind control\", which were consistent with [[Robert Lifton]]'s criteria for mind control. For example, cult members were forbidden to talk amongst themselves; doing so was a sin, called \"murmuring\".  He would eavesdrop on cult members to cause them to believe that he could read their minds.\n\nOn April 23, 1988, a neighbor told Kirtland police officer Ron Andolsek that she suspected that a cult was living at the farm house and that Lundgren's son warned the neighbor's children that on May 15 the earth would open up and demons would emerge. On April 28, 1988, a former cult member, referred by the FBI, called Kirtland Police and reported the cult's conspiracy to take over the Kirtland Temple to Chief Dennis T. Yarborough. Yarborough did not believe the informant's information and on May 2, 1988, Yarborough confronted Lundgren at the Kirtland Police Station. When Lundgren left, Yarborough said that he \"neutralized the situation\" by warning Lundgren that there were complaints about gunfire on Lundgren's property. Lundgren went back to his followers and told them that the planned May 3 Kirtland Temple takeover was off because he had spoken to a higher power. The Kirtland Police initiated surveillance of Lundgren's residence and of church-owned properties. In September 1988, a second informant came forward. Officer Andolsek cultivated the informant and made contact with the ATF and the FBI. The FBI initiated a domestic terrorism investigation.\n\nOn October 10, 1988, the day that Lundgren was excommunicated from the RLDS Church, there was a thunderstorm at the south end of Kirtland. When the sun emerged, a large rainbow appeared to the east. Lundgren told his followers that the rainbow signified the opening of the \"Seven Seals\". Lundgren and his family soon abandoned the religious group, and Lundgren began to feel a call to teach the [[Bible]] in the way he understood it. He formed his own [[sect]] soon after. Membership never exceeded twenty. These were some of the most conservative members of the RLDS Church who believed that God communicated through regular revelations although some members admitted that they claimed to have revelations even when they did not. The conservatives were also opposed to more liberal rights for women. This was during a rift with the more liberal members of the church. Alice Lundgren often acted as a cheerleader to Jeffrey Lundgren. She had claimed she had once had a revelation that she would meet an important leader of the RLDS Church. She later concluded that this alleged revelation referred to Jeffrey.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nLundgren began to offer Bible study services at his home. Lundgren would dominate the services himself and he would intimidate anyone who did not agree with him. He would later encourage others to intimidate those who disagreed as well. He sought to convince his congregation that he was God's last prophet. He asked for money from his supporters, and some would give him their life's savings, which often were calculated to be thousands of dollars.\n\nLundgren then proclaimed he had received a call from God to move to Kirtland, Ohio. According to Lundgren, he was told by God that he and his supporters would soon witness the [[second coming of Christ]] if they moved to Kirtland. Lundgren was attracted to Kirtland because it was the home of the Kirtland Temple, built by [[Joseph Smith]] and Smith's followers. Lundgren would tell his followers that on May 3 (no year specified\u2014May 3 was also Lundgren's birthday) the second coming would happen at the Kirtland Temple and that he and his followers would have to seize the Kirtland Temple by force and hold it for the second coming. The conspiracy involved burglarizing adjacent church-homes and committing murder as part of the \"Kirtland Temple takeover\". Lundgren called the land around the temple \"The Vineyards\", which had to be \"redeemed\" or \"cleansed\" for him and his followers to take the temple.\n\nBy this time, seven of Lundgren's 12 followers had moved into the family home. The remaining five were members of Dennis Avery's family. Lundgren felt that the Averys were committing a sin by not living in his house. The Avery family father, Dennis, sold his Missouri house in order for his family to move to Ohio. Dennis Avery believed in Jeffrey completely and trusted him. Jeffrey, however, considered Dennis Avery to be weak and, when Dennis was no longer useful to Jeffrey, he began talking about Dennis behind his back. Jeffrey often used Dennis as a scapegoat for their troubles even though Dennis was one of the leading contributors. Dennis Avery decided to set apart a relatively small amount of money for his family's use, with a bank account. Once again, Lundgren considered this a sin, because Lundgren wanted all of his followers' money to be given exclusively to him.\n\nIn time, Lundgren convinced his followers that they had to seize the temple, from which he had stolen about $40,000, and to kill anyone who stood in their way. He changed his mind, however, and started telling his followers that they had to kill a family of five instead if they wanted to see God. As punishment for their \"disloyalty\", he chose the Averys. At some point, he referred to the slaughter of the Avery family as \"pruning the vineyard\".\n\n== Murders ==\nOn April 10, 1989, in Kirtland, Lundgren ordered two of his followers to dig a pit in the barn, in anticipation of burying the Averys' bodies there. The expectation was that there could be five bodies buried in the pit. Lundgren told the rest of his followers, including the Averys, that they would go on a wilderness trip. On April 17, he rented a motel room and had dinner with all of his followers. He then called his group's men into his room. He questioned each as to their purpose in the action. All of the men assured Lundgren that they were with him in the sacrifice. Dennis Avery was not invited to the meeting in Lundgren's bedroom.\n\nAccording to followers' admissions, Lundgren later went inside the barn, with a church member named Ron Luff luring Dennis Avery into a place where the other men awaited by asking him for help with equipment for the camping trip. Luff attempted to render Avery unconscious with a stun gun, but due to a malfunction, a stun bullet struck Avery but failed to knock him out.\n\nAvery then was gagged and dragged to the place where Lundgren awaited. He was shot twice in the back, dying almost instantly. To mask the sound of the gun, a chainsaw was left running. Luff then told Avery's wife, Cheryl, that her husband needed help. She was gagged, like her husband, but also had duct tape put over her eyes, and dragged to Lundgren. She was shot three times, twice in the breasts and once in the abdomen. Her body lay next to her husband's. The Averys' 15-year-old daughter, Trina, was shot twice in the head. The first shot entered but ricocheted off of her skull, missing her brain, but the second killed her instantly. Thirteen-year-old Becky Avery was shot twice and left to die, while six-year-old Karen Avery was shot in the chest and head.\n\nThe barn where the incident took place was demolished on November 13, 2007.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Glasier1/>\n\n== Arrest and conviction ==\nOn April 18, 1989, the day after the murders, officers coincidentally came to Lundgren's farm to talk to him. After this encounter Lundgren became [[paranoid]] about being caught, and left Ohio with the rest of his cult, moving south to [[West Virginia]]. As months went by and nothing happened, Lundgren became disillusioned, and he and his family moved to [[California]], leaving the rest of the surviving cult members behind in West Virginia.\n\nNine months after the killings, on January 3, 1990, a tip from an informant led police back to the long-abandoned farm, where the five bodies of the Avery family were uncovered.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/> The Lundgrens became [[fugitive]]s, media attention increased, and police began to track the cult members, with the [[FBI]] joining in the manhunt. Eventually, Lundgren's abandoned followers were found back east, and they helped catch him and his family. Thirteen members of Lundgren's sect were arrested in early 1990, including Lundgren and his wife.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nJeffrey Lundgren was given the [[death sentence|death penalty]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Alice Lundgren received five [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life]] sentences (140 years to life) for [[Conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]], complicity and [[kidnapping]], while their son, Damon, was sentenced to 120 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/>  Ronald Luff, the key planner and facilitator of the murders with Lundgren, was sentenced to 170 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/> Daniel Kraft was sentenced to 50 years to life.<ref name=Timeline/> Five of the cult members were released in 2010 or early 2011, after roughly 20 years of [[prison|incarceration]] (including pre-trial period).<ref name=FourParoled/>  Prosecutor Charles Coulson confirmed that the original plea agreements meant that the five were to be eligible for release \"at the earliest possible time\", but the Ohio State Parole Board had repeatedly denied earlier requests for parole by Richard Brand and Greg Winship (both were serving 15 years to life), as well as Sharon Bluntschly, Debbie Olivarez and Susan Luff (all were serving 7 to 25 years).<ref name=FourParoled/> Lundgren followers Kathryn Johnson, Tonya Patrick and Dennis Patrick were determined not to have been involved in the murders, and each received a one year sentence for [[obstruction of justice]] (the Patricks' sentences were suspended).<ref name=Timeline/>\n\n=== Execution ===\nThe [[Ohio Supreme Court]] set October 24, 2006, as Lundgren's execution date, and according to the state attorney general's office, as of August 2006, he had exhausted his appeals.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nOn October 17, 2006, Judge [[Gregory L. Frost]] issued an order temporarily delaying Lundgren's execution. Lundgren attempted to join a [[lawsuit]] with five other Ohio [[death row]] inmates challenging the state's death penalty law, claiming that because of his [[obesity]] the [[lethal injection]] would be particularly painful and amount to [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. State Attorney General [[Jim Petro]] appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] in [[Cincinnati]].<ref name=\"TooObese\"/> The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order allowing the execution to go forward.<ref name=F3d754/> The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] refused a last-minute request to stop his execution, and Governor [[Bob Taft]] also denied clemency.<ref name=OhioExecutes/>\n\nOn October 24, 2006, Jeffrey Lundgren was executed at the [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility]] in [[Lucasville, Ohio|Lucasville]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Capital punishment in Ohio]]\n* [[Capital punishment in the United States]]\n* [[List of people executed in Ohio]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |first=Pete |last=Earley |title=Prophet of Death: the Mormon Blood-Atonement Killings |year=1991 |isbn=978-0688105846 |publisher=William Morrow |url=https://archive.org/details/prophetofdeathmo00earl }}</ref>\n<ref name=Sasse>{{cite book |last1=Sass\u00e9 |first=Cynthia Stalter |first2=Peggy Murphy |last2=Widder |title=The Kirtland Massacre |location=New York |publisher=Zebra Books |year=1992 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kirtlandmassacre00sass/page/25 25, 31] |isbn=978-0821739860 |url=https://archive.org/details/kirtlandmassacre00sass/page/25 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14500204 |title=Cult leader who killed 5 sentenced to death |date=August 24, 2006 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n<ref name=Scott>{{cite news |first=Betsy |last=Scott |title=Site of cult murders demolished |newspaper=[[The News-Herald (Ohio)|The News-Herald]] |date=November 14, 2007}}</ref>\n<ref name=Glasier1>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20150105/kirtland-cult-killings-time-has-healed-the-city-of-faith-and-beauty |title=Kirtland cult killings: Time has healed the 'City of Faith and Beauty' |first=David |last=Glasier |work=The News-Herald |date=December 31, 2014 |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=FourParoled>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20101111/NEWS/311119989 |title=Four more being paroled in Kirtland cult killings |first=David W. |last=Jones |work=The News-Herald |date=November 11, 2010 |accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=Timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20141231/NEWS/141239952  |title=Kirtland cult killings: Timeline of events |first=David |last=Glasier |work=The News-Herald |date=December 31, 2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TooObese\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/18/bc.na.gen.us.cultleader.ap/index.html |title=Cult leader says he's too obese for execution |date=October 18, 2006 |agency=AP |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019025800/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/18/bc.na.gen.us.cultleader.ap/index.html |archive-date=October 19, 2006}}</ref>\n<ref name=F3d754>{{cite court |litigants=Lundgren v.

According to hospital records, his wife was hospitalized for a ruptured [[spleen]], which may have been caused by Lundgren pushing her into a closet door handle. In 1980, the couple had their fourth child, another boy.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren was dismissed as a lay minister by the RLDS Church.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\n== Religious activities ==\nWhile Lundgren was living in a church-owned home, located next to the [[Kirtland Temple]], on Chillicothe Road, in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], Ohio, he volunteered as a tour guide of the historic [[Kirtland Temple]], for the RLDS Church. He began to teach the concept of \"dividing the word\", known as \"chiastic interpretation\" or \"[[chiasmus]]\", to interpret scriptures. Lundgren falsely claimed to have created chiastic interpretation. The foundation was that in everything created by God, the right side is a mirror image and, therefore, scripture had to be interpreted using that same method. He cited the Kirtland Temple as an example because the right side was a mirror image of the left side. To apply this concept to scripture, one takes a sentence from scripture; if the sentences before and after are consistent, the center sentence is the \"truth\"; when the sentences before and after conflict, the center sentence is a lie. His teaching of scriptural interpretations attracted his followers. Lundgren claimed that he moved to Ohio from Missouri because the word, <small>\"OHIO\"</small> is \"chiastic\". About 1987, Lundgren was asked to leave the church-owned house and his job as tour guide was terminated due to suspicions of theft.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren and his family moved to a rented farm house, located at 8671 Chardon Road on [[U.S. Route 6]] (aka: Euclid-Chardon Road), east of Ohio State Route #306. Some of the followers knew Lundgren in Missouri while others were attracted to Lundgren when they were exposed to his teachings when he was working as a Kirtland Temple tour guide. At that time, some followers started to move into his home. Those who moved into the house were Kevin Currie, Richard Brand, Greg Winship, Sharon Bluntschly, Daniel Kraft, and Debbie Olivarez. Ronald and Susan Luff; Dennis and Tonya Patrick; and Dennis and Cheryl Avery maintained their own residences. There were others whose names were not made public because they were not significant to the criminal investigation (conspiracy to deprive civil rights, the Kirtland Temple takeover, and multiple homicide of the Avery family).  While Lundgren was living at the farm house, Lundgren's teachings continued and he began to practice methods of \"mind control\", which were consistent with [[Robert Lifton]]'s criteria for mind control. For example, cult members were forbidden to talk amongst themselves; doing so was a sin, called \"murmuring\".  He would eavesdrop on cult members to cause them to believe that he could read their minds.\n\nOn April 23, 1988, a neighbor told Kirtland police officer Ron Andolsek that she suspected that a cult was living at the farm house and that Lundgren's son warned the neighbor's children that on May 15 the earth would open up and demons would emerge. On April 28, 1988, a former cult member, referred by the FBI, called Kirtland Police and reported the cult's conspiracy to take over the Kirtland Temple to Chief Dennis T. Yarborough. Yarborough did not believe the informant's information and on May 2, 1988, Yarborough confronted Lundgren at the Kirtland Police Station. When Lundgren left, Yarborough said that he \"neutralized the situation\" by warning Lundgren that there were complaints about gunfire on Lundgren's property. Lundgren went back to his followers and told them that the planned May 3 Kirtland Temple takeover was off because he had spoken to a higher power. The Kirtland Police initiated surveillance of Lundgren's residence and of church-owned properties. In September 1988, a second informant came forward. Officer Andolsek cultivated the informant and made contact with the ATF and the FBI. The FBI initiated a domestic terrorism investigation.\n\nOn October 10, 1988, the day that Lundgren was excommunicated from the RLDS Church, there was a thunderstorm at the south end of Kirtland. When the sun emerged, a large rainbow appeared to the east. Lundgren told his followers that the rainbow signified the opening of the \"Seven Seals\". Lundgren and his family soon abandoned the religious group, and Lundgren began to feel a call to teach the [[Bible]] in the way he understood it. He formed his own [[sect]] soon after. Membership never exceeded twenty. These were some of the most conservative members of the RLDS Church who believed that God communicated through regular revelations although some members admitted that they claimed to have revelations even when they did not. The conservatives were also opposed to more liberal rights for women. This was during a rift with the more liberal members of the church. Alice Lundgren often acted as a cheerleader to Jeffrey Lundgren. She had claimed she had once had a revelation that she would meet an important leader of the RLDS Church. She later concluded that this alleged revelation referred to Jeffrey.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nLundgren began to offer Bible study services at his home. Lundgren would dominate the services himself and he would intimidate anyone who did not agree with him. He would later encourage others to intimidate those who disagreed as well. He sought to convince his congregation that he was God's last prophet. He asked for money from his supporters, and some would give him their life's savings, which often were calculated to be thousands of dollars.\n\nLundgren then proclaimed he had received a call from God to move to Kirtland, Ohio. According to Lundgren, he was told by God that he and his supporters would soon witness the [[second coming of Christ]] if they moved to Kirtland. Lundgren was attracted to Kirtland because it was the home of the Kirtland Temple, built by [[Joseph Smith]] and Smith's followers. Lundgren would tell his followers that on May 3 (no year specified\u2014May 3 was also Lundgren's birthday) the second coming would happen at the Kirtland Temple and that he and his followers would have to seize the Kirtland Temple by force and hold it for the second coming. The conspiracy involved burglarizing adjacent church-homes and committing murder as part of the \"Kirtland Temple takeover\". Lundgren called the land around the temple \"The Vineyards\", which had to be \"redeemed\" or \"cleansed\" for him and his followers to take the temple.\n\nBy this time, seven of Lundgren's 12 followers had moved into the family home. The remaining five were members of Dennis Avery's family. Lundgren felt that the Averys were committing a sin by not living in his house. The Avery family father, Dennis, sold his Missouri house in order for his family to move to Ohio. Dennis Avery believed in Jeffrey completely and trusted him. Jeffrey, however, considered Dennis Avery to be weak and, when Dennis was no longer useful to Jeffrey, he began talking about Dennis behind his back. Jeffrey often used Dennis as a scapegoat for their troubles even though Dennis was one of the leading contributors. Dennis Avery decided to set apart a relatively small amount of money for his family's use, with a bank account. Once again, Lundgren considered this a sin, because Lundgren wanted all of his followers' money to be given exclusively to him.\n\nIn time, Lundgren convinced his followers that they had to seize the temple, from which he had stolen about $40,000, and to kill anyone who stood in their way. He changed his mind, however, and started telling his followers that they had to kill a family of five instead if they wanted to see God. As punishment for their \"disloyalty\", he chose the Averys. At some point, he referred to the slaughter of the Avery family as \"pruning the vineyard\".\n\n== Murders ==\nOn April 10, 1989, in Kirtland, Lundgren ordered two of his followers to dig a pit in the barn, in anticipation of burying the Averys' bodies there. The expectation was that there could be five bodies buried in the pit. Lundgren told the rest of his followers, including the Averys, that they would go on a wilderness trip. On April 17, he rented a motel room and had dinner with all of his followers. He then called his group's men into his room. He questioned each as to their purpose in the action. All of the men assured Lundgren that they were with him in the sacrifice. Dennis Avery was not invited to the meeting in Lundgren's bedroom.\n\nAccording to followers' admissions, Lundgren later went inside the barn, with a church member named Ron Luff luring Dennis Avery into a place where the other men awaited by asking him for help with equipment for the camping trip. Luff attempted to render Avery unconscious with a stun gun, but due to a malfunction, a stun bullet struck Avery but failed to knock him out.\n\nAvery then was gagged and dragged to the place where Lundgren awaited. He was shot twice in the back, dying almost instantly. To mask the sound of the gun, a chainsaw was left running. Luff then told Avery's wife, Cheryl, that her husband needed help. She was gagged, like her husband, but also had duct tape put over her eyes, and dragged to Lundgren. She was shot three times, twice in the breasts and once in the abdomen. Her body lay next to her husband's. The Averys' 15-year-old daughter, Trina, was shot twice in the head. The first shot entered but ricocheted off of her skull, missing her brain, but the second killed her instantly. Thirteen-year-old Becky Avery was shot twice and left to die, while six-year-old Karen Avery was shot in the chest and head.\n\nThe barn where the incident took place was demolished on November 13, 2007.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Glasier1/>\n\n== Arrest and conviction ==\nOn April 18, 1989, the day after the murders, officers coincidentally came to Lundgren's farm to talk to him. After this encounter Lundgren became [[paranoid]] about being caught, and left Ohio with the rest of his cult, moving south to [[West Virginia]]. As months went by and nothing happened, Lundgren became disillusioned, and he and his family moved to [[California]], leaving the rest of the surviving cult members behind in West Virginia.\n\nNine months after the killings, on January 3, 1990, a tip from an informant led police back to the long-abandoned farm, where the five bodies of the Avery family were uncovered.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/> The Lundgrens became [[fugitive]]s, media attention increased, and police began to track the cult members, with the [[FBI]] joining in the manhunt. Eventually, Lundgren's abandoned followers were found back east, and they helped catch him and his family. Thirteen members of Lundgren's sect were arrested in early 1990, including Lundgren and his wife.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nJeffrey Lundgren was given the [[death sentence|death penalty]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Alice Lundgren received five [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life]] sentences (140 years to life) for [[Conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]], complicity and [[kidnapping]], while their son, Damon, was sentenced to 120 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/>  Ronald Luff, the key planner and facilitator of the murders with Lundgren, was sentenced to 170 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/> Daniel Kraft was sentenced to 50 years to life.<ref name=Timeline/> Five of the cult members were released in 2010 or early 2011, after roughly 20 years of [[prison|incarceration]] (including pre-trial period).<ref name=FourParoled/>  Prosecutor Charles Coulson confirmed that the original plea agreements meant that the five were to be eligible for release \"at the earliest possible time\", but the Ohio State Parole Board had repeatedly denied earlier requests for parole by Richard Brand and Greg Winship (both were serving 15 years to life), as well as Sharon Bluntschly, Debbie Olivarez and Susan Luff (all were serving 7 to 25 years).<ref name=FourParoled/> Lundgren followers Kathryn Johnson, Tonya Patrick and Dennis Patrick were determined not to have been involved in the murders, and each received a one year sentence for [[obstruction of justice]] (the Patricks' sentences were suspended).<ref name=Timeline/>\n\n=== Execution ===\nThe [[Ohio Supreme Court]] set October 24, 2006, as Lundgren's execution date, and according to the state attorney general's office, as of August 2006, he had exhausted his appeals.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nOn October 17, 2006, Judge [[Gregory L. Frost]] issued an order temporarily delaying Lundgren's execution. Lundgren attempted to join a [[lawsuit]] with five other Ohio [[death row]] inmates challenging the state's death penalty law, claiming that because of his [[obesity]] the [[lethal injection]] would be particularly painful and amount to [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. State Attorney General [[Jim Petro]] appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] in [[Cincinnati]].<ref name=\"TooObese\"/> The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order allowing the execution to go forward.<ref name=F3d754/> The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] refused a last-minute request to stop his execution, and Governor [[Bob Taft]] also denied clemency.<ref name=OhioExecutes/>\n\nOn October 24, 2006, Jeffrey Lundgren was executed at the [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility]] in [[Lucasville, Ohio|Lucasville]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Capital punishment in Ohio]]\n* [[Capital punishment in the United States]]\n* [[List of people executed in Ohio]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |first=Pete |last=Earley |title=Prophet of Death: the Mormon Blood-Atonement Killings |year=1991 |isbn=978-0688105846 |publisher=William Morrow |url=https://archive.org/details/prophetofdeathmo00earl }}</ref>\n<ref name=Sasse>{{cite book |last1=Sass\u00e9 |first=Cynthia Stalter |first2=Peggy Murphy |last2=Widder |title=The Kirtland Massacre |location=New York |publisher=Zebra Books |year=1992 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kirtlandmassacre00sass/page/25 25, 31] |isbn=978-0821739860 |url=https://archive.org/details/kirtlandmassacre00sass/page/25 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14500204 |title=Cult leader who killed 5 sentenced to death |date=August 24, 2006 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n<ref name=Scott>{{cite news |first=Betsy |last=Scott |title=Site of cult murders demolished |newspaper=[[The News-Herald (Ohio)|The News-Herald]] |date=November 14, 2007}}</ref>\n<ref name=Glasier1>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20150105/kirtland-cult-killings-time-has-healed-the-city-of-faith-and-beauty |title=Kirtland cult killings: Time has healed the 'City of Faith and Beauty' |first=David |last=Glasier |work=The News-Herald |date=December 31, 2014 |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=FourParoled>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20101111/NEWS/311119989 |title=Four more being paroled in Kirtland cult killings |first=David W. |last=Jones |work=The News-Herald |date=November 11, 2010 |accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=Timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20141231/NEWS/141239952  |title=Kirtland cult killings: Timeline of events |first=David |last=Glasier |work=The News-Herald |date=December 31, 2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TooObese\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/18/bc.na.gen.us.cultleader.ap/index.html |title=Cult leader says he's too obese for execution |date=October 18, 2006 |agency=AP |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019025800/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/18/bc.na.gen.us.cultleader.ap/index.html |archive-date=October 19, 2006}}</ref>\n<ref name=F3d754>{{cite court |litigants=Lundgren v.
