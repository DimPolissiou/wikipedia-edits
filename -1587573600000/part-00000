On October 25, 1997, Farley made his final appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'', the only time he hosted the show. Farley's hoarse voice and flushed skin were the subject of public scrutiny. He spoofed his style comedy in the opener by convincing Lorne Michaels he was fit for performance by divebombing Michaels' desk. In actuality, Farley had strained his vocal cords during performance and his exhaustion was so noticeable the producers nearly recommended cancelling his appearance. Farley's hosting had been considered so troublesome to the cast and crew that it was decided to be pulled from general circulation and from general syndication as well as the ''SNL'' seasonal streaming, a decision only shared with [[Steven Seagal]]'s hosting.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Shales|first2=James Andrew|last2=Miller|title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live|publisher=Back Bay|location=New York City|year=2003|pages=492\u201393|isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281398,00.html|title=The Last Temptation of Chris|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 9, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn December 18, 1997, Farley was found dead by his younger brother, [[John P.

He made a guest appearance on [[Nickelodeon]]'s children's sketch comedy show ''All That'', doing a sketch alongside future ''SNL'' cast member [[Kenan Thompson]]. The appearance proceeded without incident, but the stunt comedy Farley was famous for was minimal, arguably because it was noticeable Farley was wheezing heavily and straining himself to perform. On October 25, 1997, Farley made his final appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'', the only time he hosted the show. Farley's hoarse voice and flushed skin were the subject of public scrutiny. He spoofed his style comedy in the opener by convincing Lorne Michaels he was fit for performance by divebombing Michaels' desk. In actuality, Farley had strained his vocal cords during performance and his exhaustion was so noticeable the producers nearly recommended cancelling his appearance. Farley's hosting had been considered so troublesome to the cast and crew that it was decided to be pulled from general circulation and from general syndication as well as the ''SNL'' seasonal streaming, a decision only shared with [[Steven Seagal]]'s hosting.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Shales|first2=James Andrew|last2=Miller|title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live|publisher=Back Bay|location=New York City|year=2003|pages=492\u201393|isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281398,00.html|title=The Last Temptation of Chris|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 9, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn December 18, 1997, Farley was found dead by his younger brother, [[John P.

Weekly]]'' in 1988 and has been developed by Sweeney (in collaboration with Jim Emerson) into a screenplay; and the [[androgyny|androgynous]] [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], whose impossible-to-determine [[gender]] was the basis for Sweeney's popular ''It's Pat!'' skits on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and later for her feature film of the same name, which was pulled from theaters after one week due to its immensely negative reception.<ref name=\"PBSSweeney\" />\n\nIn 1992, she also worked with the rock band [[Ugly Kid Joe]], performing in the music video for their hit \"Neighbor\" and contributing introductory audio to two tracks, \"Goddamn Devil\" and \"[[Everything About You (Ugly Kid Joe song)|Everything About You]]\". The latter was on the soundtrack to the [[Lorne Michaels]] movie ''[[Wayne's World]]''.\n\nIn 1994, she had a small role as \"Raquel\" in the movie ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.\n\n=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===\nAt a [[Groundlings]] performance in 1989, ''Saturday Night Live'' (''SNL'') producer [[Lorne Michaels]] discovered Sweeney{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and offered her a spot as one of ''SNL's'' featured players. She joined the regular ''SNL'' cast the following year and remained with the show through four seasons, from 1990 to 1994. One of her most memorable and popular characters was [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], whose indeterminate gender confused other characters who would try to determine it. (Sweeney would play the character in a feature film, ''[[It's Pat]]'', for which she was one of the writers.)\n\nSweeney's 1993 impression of US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s daughter [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]] caused a stir when First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] found it offensive and sent an angry letter to the show.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wbez.org/story/wikipedia-files/introducing-wikipedia-files-julia-sweeney |title=Introducing The Wikipedia Files (with Julia Sweeney)!  |first= Andrew |last= Gill |date=April 10, 2009 |publisher= WBEZ |work= WBEZ.org  |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Monologues ===\nSweeney has created and performed three autobiographical monologues, ''God Said Ha!'', ''In the Family Way'', and ''Letting Go of God''.\n\n====''God Said Ha!''====\nAfter leaving the cast of ''Saturday Night Live'', Sweeney returned to Los Angeles where, shortly afterwards, her career was put on hold by a series of personal traumas. Her brother Michael was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]], and shortly thereafter Sweeney discovered that she too had cancer.<ref>{{YouTube|_7vsUflfPLA|Julia tells about her surgery and treatment}}</ref> Her brother did not survive the cancer. Throughout the ordeal, Sweeney told stories of her experiences in serio-comic performances at L.A.'s [[alternative comedy]] club, the [[Un-Cabaret]], eventually developing the stories into a one-woman stage show, ''God Said Ha!'', which debuted at San Francisco's Magic Theater in 1995.<ref name=tal9>{{cite web|work=This American Life | title= Episode 9: Julia Sweeney |  url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/9/julia-sweeney |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''God Said Ha!'' moved to Broadway, winning the 1996 New York Comedy Festival's Audience Award, and a CD recording of the show earned her a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Comedy Album that same year. [[Miramax]] released a [[God Said Ha!|film version of the show]] in 1998, directed by Sweeney and produced by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. The film earned the [[Golden Space Needle Award]] at the Seattle Film Festival. It was released on DVD in 2003. Portions of the monologues from Un-Cabaret were featured on ''[[This American Life]]'' (then known as ''Your Radio Playhouse'') in January 1996 in [[List of 1996 This American Life episodes|episode 9]].

''In the Family Way'' started on stage in New York City in early 2003 at the [[Ars Nova Theatre]]. The show was directed by the Broadway stage director, [[Mark Brokaw]]. The show then migrated to the Groundlings Theatre in Los Angeles. Sweeney has also released a CD recording of ''In the Family Way'', and in 2006 she performed a 25-minute excerpt of this show at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with a new orchestration written especially for her piece by the composer [[Anthony Marinelli]] and performed by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].<ref name=\"MusicConnection 1-1-07\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kimpel|first1=Dan|url=https://archive.org/details/MusicConnection010107XXXINo_01Interview |title=Award-Winning Film Composer|accessdate=18 September 2015|issue=XXXI, No. 1|magazine=[[Music Connection]]|date=1 January 2007|page=22}}</ref><ref name=\"LAPhil In the Family Way\">{{cite web|title=Comedy Tonight!

In it, she discusses her Catholic upbringing, early religious ideology, and the life events and internal search that led her to believe that the universe can function on its own without a deity to preside over it, and to her becoming an [[atheist]]. Sweeney shares the account of when her mother told her that her birthday was really October 10 instead of September 10, and how traumatic it was to discover she was not a winsome [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] but really a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2013/11/22/245953429/how-does-a-person-go-from-believer-to-atheist \"How Does A Person Go From Believer To Atheist?\"].

It was at The Groundlings that she began to develop characters, which she would later bring to the stage, film, and television.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/notable-alumni-of-the-groundlings-improv-troupe/16/|title=Notable alumni of the Groundlings improv troupe|date=2015-06-25|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> They include Mea Culpa, the title character of ''Mea's Big Apology'' (co-written by then-husband Stephen Hibbert), which won the Best Written Play Award from ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' in 1988 and has been developed by Sweeney (in collaboration with Jim Emerson) into a screenplay; and the [[androgyny|androgynous]] [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], whose impossible-to-determine [[gender]] was the basis for Sweeney's popular ''It's Pat!'' skits on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and later for her feature film of the same name, which was pulled from theaters after one week due to its immensely negative reception.<ref name=\"PBSSweeney\" />\n\nIn 1992, she also worked with the rock band [[Ugly Kid Joe]], performing in the music video for their hit \"Neighbor\" and contributing introductory audio to two tracks, \"Goddamn Devil\" and \"[[Everything About You (Ugly Kid Joe song)|Everything About You]]\". The latter was on the soundtrack to the [[Lorne Michaels]] movie ''[[Wayne's World]]''.\n\nIn 1994, she had a small role as \"Raquel\" in the movie ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.\n\n=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===\nAt a [[Groundlings]] performance in 1989, ''Saturday Night Live'' (''SNL'') producer [[Lorne Michaels]] discovered Sweeney{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and offered her a spot as one of ''SNL's'' featured players. She joined the regular ''SNL'' cast the following year and remained with the show through four seasons, from 1990 to 1994. One of her most memorable and popular characters was [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], whose indeterminate gender confused other characters who would try to determine it. (Sweeney would play the character in a feature film, ''[[It's Pat]]'', for which she was one of the writers.)\n\nSweeney's 1993 impression of US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s daughter [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]] caused a stir when First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] found it offensive and sent an angry letter to the show.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wbez.org/story/wikipedia-files/introducing-wikipedia-files-julia-sweeney |title=Introducing The Wikipedia Files (with Julia Sweeney)!  |first= Andrew |last= Gill |date=April 10, 2009 |publisher= WBEZ |work= WBEZ.org  |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Monologues ===\nSweeney has created and performed three autobiographical monologues, ''God Said Ha!'', ''In the Family Way'', and ''Letting Go of God''.\n\n====''God Said Ha!''====\nAfter leaving the cast of ''Saturday Night Live'', Sweeney returned to Los Angeles where, shortly afterwards, her career was put on hold by a series of personal traumas. Her brother Michael was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]], and shortly thereafter Sweeney discovered that she too had cancer.<ref>{{YouTube|_7vsUflfPLA|Julia tells about her surgery and treatment}}</ref> Her brother did not survive the cancer. Throughout the ordeal, Sweeney told stories of her experiences in serio-comic performances at L.A.'s [[alternative comedy]] club, the [[Un-Cabaret]], eventually developing the stories into a one-woman stage show, ''God Said Ha!'', which debuted at San Francisco's Magic Theater in 1995.<ref name=tal9>{{cite web|work=This American Life | title= Episode 9: Julia Sweeney |  url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/9/julia-sweeney |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''God Said Ha!'' moved to Broadway, winning the 1996 New York Comedy Festival's Audience Award, and a CD recording of the show earned her a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Comedy Album that same year. [[Miramax]] released a [[God Said Ha!|film version of the show]] in 1998, directed by Sweeney and produced by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. The film earned the [[Golden Space Needle Award]] at the Seattle Film Festival. It was released on DVD in 2003. Portions of the monologues from Un-Cabaret were featured on ''[[This American Life]]'' (then known as ''Your Radio Playhouse'') in January 1996 in [[List of 1996 This American Life episodes|episode 9]]. Since her initial monologue, she has appeared on three more ''This American Life'' episodes.<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/search?keys=julia%20sweeney Julia Sweeney search results] at ''This American Life''</ref>\n\n====''In the Family Way''====\nSweeney's second monologue chronicled the adoption of her daughter from China. ''In the Family Way'' started on stage in New York City in early 2003 at the [[Ars Nova Theatre]]. The show was directed by the Broadway stage director, [[Mark Brokaw]]. The show then migrated to the Groundlings Theatre in Los Angeles. Sweeney has also released a CD recording of ''In the Family Way'', and in 2006 she performed a 25-minute excerpt of this show at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with a new orchestration written especially for her piece by the composer [[Anthony Marinelli]] and performed by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].<ref name=\"MusicConnection 1-1-07\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kimpel|first1=Dan|url=https://archive.org/details/MusicConnection010107XXXINo_01Interview |title=Award-Winning Film Composer|accessdate=18 September 2015|issue=XXXI, No. 1|magazine=[[Music Connection]]|date=1 January 2007|page=22}}</ref><ref name=\"LAPhil In the Family Way\">{{cite web|title=Comedy Tonight!

In it, she discusses her Catholic upbringing, early religious ideology, and the life events and internal search that led her to believe that the universe can function on its own without a deity to preside over it, and to her becoming an [[atheist]]. Sweeney shares the account of when her mother told her that her birthday was really October 10 instead of September 10, and how traumatic it was to discover she was not a winsome [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] but really a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2013/11/22/245953429/how-does-a-person-go-from-believer-to-atheist \"How Does A Person Go From Believer To Atheist?\"].

An audio recording of ''Letting Go of God'' was released on CD in 2006, and it was filmed live on stage in May 2007.

After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including \"[[The Thanksgiving Song]]\" and \"[[The Chanukah Song]]\".<ref name=biography.com/> Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995, and played this up in his return to the show as a host in 2019.<ref name=\"Sandler fired\">{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Adam Sandler's \"I Was Fired\" Monologue - SNL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghK5yMpNuc |publisher=SNL}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' with Chris Farley, [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]].

He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''Happy Gilmore'' (1996) and ''The Wedding Singer'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor party\u2013themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), one of his first hits.\n\nAlthough his earliest films did not receive favorable critical attention, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' in 2002.

An 18th-century Georgian geographer and historian [[Vakhushti Bagrationi]] wrote that there are 365 Orthodox churches in Georgia named after Saint George, according to the number of days in one year.<ref name=\"Gabidzashvili\">Gabidzashvili, Enriko. 1991.

While not technically named after the saint (''Sakartvelo'' is the Georgian name for the country), its English name is an early and well-attested [[back-derivation]] of Saint George. The name is reputed to be an [[Calque|anglicisation]] of ''Gurj'', derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for the frightening and heroic people in that territory, and hence assumed by early medieval chroniclers to [[folk etymology|translate as George]], due to the existing patronage.<ref>David Marshall Lang, ''The Georgians,'' (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1966), 17-18. The terms Georgia and Georgians appeared in Western Europe in numerous early medieval annals. The French chronicler [[Jacques de Vitry]] and the English traveler [[John Mandeville|Sir John Mandeville]] wrote that Georgians are called ''Georgian'' because they especially revere Saint George.</ref>\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church commemorates St. George's day twice a year, on 6 May (O.C. 23 April) and 23 November. The [[feast day]] in November was instituted by [[Saint Nino|St Nino]] of [[Cappadocia]], who was credited with bringing Christianity to the land of Georgia in the 4th century. She was from Cappadocia, like Saint George, and was said to be his relative. This feast day is unique to Georgia, and it is the day of St George's [[martyrdom]].\n\n[[File:Greater coat of arms of Georgia.svg|thumb|\"White George\" on the [[Coat of arms of Georgia (country)|coat of arms of Georgia]]]]\n\nThere are also many folk traditions in Georgia that vary from [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] rules, because they portray the Saint differently from the Church, and show the veneration of Saint George by the common people of Georgia. Different regions of Georgia have different traditions, and in most folk tales Saint George is venerated very highly, almost as much as [[Jesus]] himself. In the province of [[Kakheti]], there is an icon of St George known as ''White George''. This image is also seen on the current Coat of Arms of Georgia. The region of Pshavi has icons known as the ''Cuppola St. George'' and ''Lashari St. George''. The [[Khevsureti]] region has ''Kakhmati'', ''Gudani'', and ''Sanebi'' icons dedicated to the Saint. The Pshavs and Khevsurs during the [[Middle Ages]] used to refer to Saint George almost as much as praying to [[God]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Another notable icon is known as the ''Lomisi Saint George'', which can be found in the [[Mtiuleti]] and [[Khevi]] provinces of Georgia.<ref name=\"Gabidzashvili\" />\n\n[[File:StGeorge.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint George in the [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Freedom Square]] in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia]]\n\nAn example of a folk tale about St. George is given by author Enriko Gabidzashvili:\n\n{{quote|Once the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], the prophet [[Elijah|Elias]] and Saint George were going through Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian shepherd man and decided to ask him to feed them. First, Elias went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elias said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming.  The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.\n\nAfter Elias, Jesus Christ himself went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep and told him that he was God, the creator of everything. The shepherd became angry at Jesus and told him that he is the one who takes the souls away of young men and grants long lives to many dishonest people.\n\nAfter Elias and Christ's unsuccessful attempts, St George went up to the shepherd, asked him for a sheep and told him that he is Saint George who the shepherd calls upon every time when he has troubles and ''[to protect him from all evil]''... The shepherd fell down on his knees and adored him and gave him everything.\" The tale shows the degree to which St George was venerated in Georgia, and similar tales are told in parts of Georgia today.<ref name=\"Gabidzashvili\" />}}\n\nSome interesting tales come from Georgian sources, some of which are also attested to by [[Persia]]n ones, that the Georgian Army during many battles was led by a knight on a white horse who came down from Heaven, that's why Georgia won battles with 10 times smaller army. Catholicos Besarion of Georgia also testified of this.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n\u10d2\u10d8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d2\u10d8 (''[[giorgi]]''), the Georgian variant of name George, is historically the most popular given name for men in Georgia.\n\n===England===\n[[File:Britain Needs You at Once - WWI recruitment poster - Parliamentary Recruiting Committee Poster No. 108.jpg|thumb|upright|British recruitment poster from [[World War I]], featuring St. George and the Dragon.]]\nTraces of the cult of St George predate the [[Norman Conquest]], in 9th-century liturgy used at [[Durham Cathedral]], in a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon [[martyrology]], and in dedications to Saint George at [[Fordington, Dorset|Fordington]], Dorset, at [[Thetford]], [[Southwark]] and [[Doncaster]]. He received further impetus when the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] returned from the [[Holy Land]] in the 12th century. At the [[Siege of Antioch#Battle of Antioch|Battle of Antioch]] in 1098, St George, [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St Demetrius]] and [[St Maurice]] were said to have been seen riding alongside the crusaders, and depictions of this event can be seen in a number of churches.<ref>M.D. Anderson, ''History and Images in British Churches'' (1995, pp. 195-196)</ref> King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (reigned 1327\u201377) was known for promoting the codes of [[knighthood]] and in 1348 founded the [[Order of the Garter]].

Edward dedicated the [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]] to the soldier saint who represented the knightly values of [[chivalry]] which he so much admired, and the Garter ceremony takes place there every year. In the 16th century, [[Edmund Spenser]] included St. George (Redcross Knight) as a central figure in his epic poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] firmly placed St George within the national conscience in his play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', in which the English troops are rallied with the cry \"God for Harry, England and St George,\" and in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and ''[[King Lear]]''.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SVH06 2.jpg|thumb|left|A 2006 gold proof [[half sovereign]] by the [[Royal Mint]] depicting St George killing the dragon]] -->\n\n<center>{{quote| Advance our standards, set upon our foes Our ancient world of courage fair<br />St. George Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons...<small>Richard III. act v, sc.3.</small>}}</center>\n\n<center>{{quote|Come not between the Dragon and his wrath...<small>Shakespeare.

Above the [[Palace of Westminster]], there are six shields above each of the four clock faces of [[Big Ben]], twenty-four in total, all depicting the arms of St George, representing the [[Flag of England]], [[London]] as the capital city of England, and St. George as the [[patron saint]] of England. This symbolism is also repeated in the central lobby of the [[Houses of Parliament]], in an enormous mosaic created by [[Edward Poynter|Sir Edward John Poynter]] in 1869, depicting [[Saint George and the Dragon|St George and the Dragon]] with these arms &c, entitled \"St George for England\".<ref>Jarrold Publishing, Norwich.

Nevertheless, it was not until the time of King [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] (1291\u20131357) that the use of ''S\u00e3o Jorge!!'' (Saint George) as a [[battle cry]], substituted for the former ''Sant'Iago!!'' ([[Saint James the Greater|Saint James]]). [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] (1360\u20131431), [[Saint Constable]] of Portugal, considered Saint George the leader of the Portuguese victory in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]]. King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] (1357\u20131433) was also a devotee of the saint and was in his reign that Saint George replaced Saint James as the main patron saint of Portugal. In 1387, he ordered that its image on horse be carried in the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] procession.<ref>Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages, By A.

However, it was not until 1730 that Saint George was officially adopted as Moscow's patron saint, and the mounted soldier would be interpreted as Saint George. There are several statues of Saint George and the dragon in Moscow, all of which are recent, owing to the fact that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] forbade sculptural representations of saints, and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviets]] discouraged religious emblems.\nThe arms of Moscow also appears on the [[coat of arms of Russia]], as a small shield on the breast of the double-headed eagle.

While not technically named after the saint (''Sakartvelo'' is the Georgian name for the country), its English name is an early and well-attested [[back-derivation]] of Saint George. The name is reputed to be an [[Calque|anglicisation]] of ''Gurj'', derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for the frightening and heroic people in that territory, and hence assumed by early medieval chroniclers to [[folk etymology|translate as George]], due to the existing patronage.<ref>David Marshall Lang, ''The Georgians,'' (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1966), 17-18. The terms Georgia and Georgians appeared in Western Europe in numerous early medieval annals. The French chronicler [[Jacques de Vitry]] and the English traveler [[John Mandeville|Sir John Mandeville]] wrote that Georgians are called ''Georgian'' because they especially revere Saint George.</ref>\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church commemorates St. George's day twice a year, on 6 May (O.C. 23 April) and 23 November. The [[feast day]] in November was instituted by [[Saint Nino|St Nino]] of [[Cappadocia]], who was credited with bringing Christianity to the land of Georgia in the 4th century. She was from Cappadocia, like Saint George, and was said to be his relative. This feast day is unique to Georgia, and it is the day of St George's [[martyrdom]].\n\n[[File:Greater coat of arms of Georgia.svg|thumb|\"White George\" on the [[Coat of arms of Georgia (country)|coat of arms of Georgia]]]]\n\nThere are also many folk traditions in Georgia that vary from [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] rules, because they portray the Saint differently from the Church, and show the veneration of Saint George by the common people of Georgia. Different regions of Georgia have different traditions, and in most folk tales Saint George is venerated very highly, almost as much as [[Jesus]] himself. In the province of [[Kakheti]], there is an icon of St George known as ''White George''. This image is also seen on the current Coat of Arms of Georgia. The region of Pshavi has icons known as the ''Cuppola St. George'' and ''Lashari St. George''. The [[Khevsureti]] region has ''Kakhmati'', ''Gudani'', and ''Sanebi'' icons dedicated to the Saint. The Pshavs and Khevsurs during the [[Middle Ages]] used to refer to Saint George almost as much as praying to [[God]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].

When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian shepherd man and decided to ask him to feed them. First, Elias went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elias said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming.  The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.\n\nAfter Elias, Jesus Christ himself went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep and told him that he was God, the creator of everything. The shepherd became angry at Jesus and told him that he is the one who takes the souls away of young men and grants long lives to many dishonest people.\n\nAfter Elias and Christ's unsuccessful attempts, St George went up to the shepherd, asked him for a sheep and told him that he is Saint George who the shepherd calls upon every time when he has troubles and ''[to protect him from all evil]''... The shepherd fell down on his knees and adored him and gave him everything.\" The tale shows the degree to which St George was venerated in Georgia, and similar tales are told in parts of Georgia today.<ref name=\"Gabidzashvili\" />}}\n\nSome interesting tales come from Georgian sources, some of which are also attested to by [[Persia]]n ones, that the Georgian Army during many battles was led by a knight on a white horse who came down from Heaven, that's why Georgia won battles with 10 times smaller army.

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] (1360\u20131431), [[Saint Constable]] of Portugal, considered Saint George the leader of the Portuguese victory in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]]. King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] (1357\u20131433) was also a devotee of the saint and was in his reign that Saint George replaced Saint James as the main patron saint of Portugal.

After opening a show by comedian [[Dennis Miller]] in 1987, Schneider won a slot on [[HBO]]'s 13th Annual Young Comedians special, which was hosted by Miller. Schneider's appearance on the HBO special led to a position as a writer for the late night [[NBC]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\n=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===\nSchneider was hired at ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1988. Schneider swiftly graduated from writer and featured player to full cast member.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[History of SNL:1990-1995|From 1990 to 1994 at ''SNL'']], he played such roles as \"Tiny Elvis\" and \"Orgasm Guy\".

He also appeared in a recurring part on the TV series ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]''. In 1996, he co-starred in the [[NBC]] sit-com ''[[Men Behaving Badly (U.S. TV series)|Men Behaving Badly]]'', an American take on the hit British series of the same name. The U.S. version ran for two seasons.\n\nSchneider starred in the 1999 feature film ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'', a tale of a fish-tank cleaner who incurs a massive debt and is forced to become a \"man-whore.\" This was followed by ''[[The Animal]]'', about a man given animal powers by a mad scientist; ''[[The Hot Chick]]'', wherein the body of a petty thief named Clive (played by Schneider) is mystically switched with the body of a pretty, but mean-spirited high school cheerleader (played by [[Rachel McAdams]] in her film debut); and the sequel ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]''. The latter movie was not well received by critics or moviegoers, and as a result, Schneider won a [[2005 Golden Raspberry Awards|2005 Worst Actor Razzie Award]] for his role in the film.<ref>{{IMDb name|1705|section=awards}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Schneider co-starred in the baseball-themed family comedy ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', along with his fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[David Spade]] as well as [[Jon Heder]]. Other film roles include Schneider's appearance with [[The Muppets|Jim Henson's Muppets]] in the 1999 film ''[[Muppets from Space]]'', and his role as a San Francisco hobo in the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''.\n\nSchneider's directorial debut, the comedy ''[[Big Stan]]'', was released in some overseas markets during the fall of 2008, with a U.S. release in early 2009. In the film, he starred as a con artist who is arrested for perpetrating real-estate scams. He is sentenced to prison, so he takes a crash-course in martial arts to survive incarceration.\n\nSchneider has also appeared in numerous comedies starring his ''SNL'' comrade [[Adam Sandler]], most recently in 2010's ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]''. The comedic characters Schneider plays in these films include an overly enthusiastic [[Cajun]] man who proclaims the catch-phrase, \"You can do it!\"; an amiable Middle Eastern delivery boy; a prison inmate; and Sandler's one-eyed Hawaiian sidekick, Ula. Schneider has uttered the line \"You can do it!\" as a running gag in Sandler's films ''[[The Waterboy]]'', ''[[Little Nicky]]'', ''[[50 First Dates]]'', ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', and ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'', as well as in a deleted scene from ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]''. (A sample of Schneider saying the phrase also turns up in the song \"[[Original Prankster]]\" by [[The Offspring]].) Returning the favor, Sandler appeared in a cameo to spout the same line in Schneider's ''[[The Animal]]'', wherein, as a reference, Adam Sandler utters: \"Yeah! You can do it!\" Sandler also showed up briefly in Schneider's ''[[The Hot Chick]]''. Schneider narrated Sandler's 2002 animated movie ''[[Eight Crazy Nights]]'', and voiced the part of a Chinese waiter.

After opening a show by comedian [[Dennis Miller]] in 1987, Schneider won a slot on [[HBO]]'s 13th Annual Young Comedians special, which was hosted by Miller.

Schneider swiftly graduated from writer and featured player to full cast member.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[History of SNL:1990-1995|From 1990 to 1994 at ''SNL'']], he played such roles as \"Tiny Elvis\" and \"Orgasm Guy\".

He also appeared in a recurring part on the TV series ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]''. In 1996, he co-starred in the [[NBC]] sit-com ''[[Men Behaving Badly (U.S. TV series)|Men Behaving Badly]]'', an American take on the hit British series of the same name. The U.S. version ran for two seasons.\n\nSchneider starred in the 1999 feature film ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'', a tale of a fish-tank cleaner who incurs a massive debt and is forced to become a \"man-whore.\" This was followed by ''[[The Animal]]'', about a man given animal powers by a mad scientist; ''[[The Hot Chick]]'', wherein the body of a petty thief named Clive (played by Schneider) is mystically switched with the body of a pretty, but mean-spirited high school cheerleader (played by [[Rachel McAdams]] in her film debut); and the sequel ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]''. The latter movie was not well received by critics or moviegoers, and as a result, Schneider won a [[2005 Golden Raspberry Awards|2005 Worst Actor Razzie Award]] for his role in the film.<ref>{{IMDb name|1705|section=awards}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Schneider co-starred in the baseball-themed family comedy ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', along with his fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[David Spade]] as well as [[Jon Heder]]. Other film roles include Schneider's appearance with [[The Muppets|Jim Henson's Muppets]] in the 1999 film ''[[Muppets from Space]]'', and his role as a San Francisco hobo in the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''.\n\nSchneider's directorial debut, the comedy ''[[Big Stan]]'', was released in some overseas markets during the fall of 2008, with a U.S. release in early 2009.

He is sentenced to prison, so he takes a crash-course in martial arts to survive incarceration.\n\nSchneider has also appeared in numerous comedies starring his ''SNL'' comrade [[Adam Sandler]], most recently in 2010's ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]''. The comedic characters Schneider plays in these films include an overly enthusiastic [[Cajun]] man who proclaims the catch-phrase, \"You can do it!\"; an amiable Middle Eastern delivery boy; a prison inmate; and Sandler's one-eyed Hawaiian sidekick, Ula. Schneider has uttered the line \"You can do it!\" as a running gag in Sandler's films ''[[The Waterboy]]'', ''[[Little Nicky]]'', ''[[50 First Dates]]'', ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', and ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'', as well as in a deleted scene from ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]''. (A sample of Schneider saying the phrase also turns up in the song \"[[Original Prankster]]\" by [[The Offspring]].) Returning the favor, Sandler appeared in a cameo to spout the same line in Schneider's ''[[The Animal]]'', wherein, as a reference, Adam Sandler utters: \"Yeah! You can do it!\" Sandler also showed up briefly in Schneider's ''[[The Hot Chick]]''. Schneider narrated Sandler's 2002 animated movie ''[[Eight Crazy Nights]]'', and voiced the part of a Chinese waiter. Schneider also had an uncredited cameo as a Canadian-Japanese wedding-chapel minister in the 2007 Sandler-[[Kevin James]] comedy ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry]]'', and played a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cab driver who serves as the title character's nemesis in the 2008 Sandler film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]''.\n\nSchneider played a variety of roles in the 2005 TV special ''Back to Norm'', starring another former ''SNL'' player [[Norm Macdonald]], and appeared on episodes of the popular TV shows ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Schneider hosted the ''Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit '97'' TV special, and the 2005 ''[[Teen Choice Awards]]'', and was a frequent guest on NBC's late-night variety program ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. In Schneider's appearance with Leno on the July 24, 2007 episode of ''The Tonight Show,'' he showed up in drag as actress [[Lindsay Lohan]] after the latter cancelled following a controversial arrest for [[driving under the influence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/rob-schneider-in-drag-fills-in-for-lindsay-lohan-on-tonight-show/|title=Rob Schneider (in Drag) Fills in for Lindsay Lohan on Tonight Show|author=|date=|website=people.com|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBesides his efforts in movies and television, Schneider released his first comedy album ''[[Registered Offender (comedy album)|Registered Offender]]'' in July 2010.
