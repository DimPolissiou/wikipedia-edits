The owner of the house is a widow named [[Blanche Devereaux]] (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow [[Rose Nylund]] (White) and divorc\u00e9e [[Dorothy Zbornak]] (Arthur), after they both responded to an ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store a year before the start of the series.

The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food. They decided that a separate cook would distract from their friendship. In addition, the character of Sophia had originally been planned as an occasional guest star, but Getty had tested so positively with preview audiences that the producers decided to make her a regular character.<ref>{{cite web| last=Kovalchik |first=Kara |title=7 Things You Might Not Know About The Golden Girls From Mental Floss |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/19134/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-golden-girls/ |accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Finale===\nAfter six consecutive seasons in the top 10, and the seventh season at number 30, ''The Golden Girls'' came to an end when Bea Arthur chose to leave the series. In the hour-long [[series finale]], which aired in May 1992, Dorothy meets and marries Blanche's uncle Lucas ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) and moves to Hollingsworth Manor in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Sophia was to join her, but in the end, she stays behind with the other women in Miami. This led into the spin-off series, ''[[The Golden Palace]]''.\n\nThe series finale of The Golden Girls was watched by 27.2 million viewers.

Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], to Sicilian immigrants Sophia and Salvadore Petrillo, Dorothy became pregnant while still in [[high school]], resulting in a marriage to Stanley Zbornak ([[Herb Edelman]]) [[shotgun wedding|to legitimize the baby]]. Stan and Dorothy eventually moved to Miami, but divorced after 38 years when Stan left her for a young flight attendant. The marriage produced two children; Kate, in her early 20s, and Michael, who was inconsistently aged between his mid-20s and late 30s (Michael was purportedly the cause of the shotgun wedding). In the series' final episode, Dorothy marries Blanche's uncle, Lucas Hollingsworth, and relocates to Atlanta. Arthur also played Dorothy's grandmother, Sophia's mother, in a flashback episode to when they lived in Brooklyn in the 1950s when Dorothy was a young adult (even though two episodes -- \"My Father, my Brother\" and \"The Days and Nights of Sophia Petrillo\" stated that Sophia's mother died when Dorothy was younger). In season one episode seven, Dorothy is stated to be 55.\n* [[Betty White]] as [[Rose Nylund]] (n\u00e9e Lindstr\u00f6m), a [[Norwegian American]] from the small farming town of [[St. Olaf, Minnesota]]. Often slightly naive and known for her humorously peculiar stories of life growing up in her hometown, Rose was happily married to Charlie Nylund, with whom she had five children; daughters Kirsten, Bridget, Gunilla; and sons Adam and Charlie, Jr. Upon Charlie's death, she moved to Miami. She eventually finds work at a grief counseling center, but later switches careers and becomes assistant to consumer reporter Enrique Mas at a local TV station. In later seasons, Rose became romantically involved with college professor Miles Webber. During season six, Webber was placed into the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]], but returned later in the season. Their relationship continued throughout the series and shortly into the sequel series, ''The Golden Palace''.\n* [[Rue McClanahan]] as [[Blanche Devereaux]] (n\u00e9e Hollingsworth), a [[Southern belle]] employed at an art museum. Born into a wealthy family, Blanche grew up as the apple of her father's eye on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Atlanta, Georgia, prior to her relocation to Miami, where she lived with her husband, George, until his death. Their marriage produced six children; daughters Janet and Rebecca; and sons Doug, Biff, Skippy, and Matthew. A widow, Blanche was portrayed as man-hungry and clearly had the most male admirers and stories detailing various sexual encounters over the course of the series.\n* [[Estelle Getty]] as [[Sophia Petrillo]]<!-- If adding maiden name, please cite an episode or reliable source for verifiability -->, Dorothy's mother. Born in [[Sicily]], Sophia moved to New York after fleeing an [[arranged marriage]] to Guido Spirelli. She married Salvadore \"Sal\" Petrillo, with whom she had three children: Dorothy, Gloria, and Phil, a cross-dresser who later dies of a heart attack (episode \"[[Ebbtide's Revenge]]\"). Initially a resident of the Shady Pines retirement home after having a stroke prior to the start of the series, she moved in with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy following a fire at the institution. During the series' run, Sophia married Max Weinstock, but they soon separated. Throughout the series, she held a few part-time jobs, mostly involving food, including as a fast-food worker and an entrepreneur of spaghetti sauce and homemade sandwiches.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Herb Edelman]] as Stanley Zbornak, Dorothy's cheating, freeloading ex-husband who left her to marry a young flight attendant, who later left him. Stan married another woman in season 4, and they divorced off-screen in season 5. Stanley worked as an unsuccessful novelty salesman until he became a successful entrepreneur by inventing a baked potato opener that made him wealthy.\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Miles Webber (or Nicholas Carbone/Samuel Plankmaker) is Rose's professor boyfriend from season 5 onwards. In season 6, Miles reveals he is in the witness protection program and was a bookkeeper for a mobster. Gould also guest-starred once in the first season as Arnie Peterson, Rose's first serious boyfriend after her husband Charlie's death.\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Salvadore Petrillo, Sophia's late husband, who is usually seen in dreams or flashback sequences. Melton also appears as Don the Fool, a waiter at a medieval restaurant in season six.\n* Shawn Schepps and Debra Engle, as Blanche's daughter, Rebecca Devereaux. Initially an overweight former model in an emotionally abusive relationship, she later slimmed down and had a baby girl named Aurora by [[artificial insemination]].\n* [[Monte Markham]] and [[Sheree North]] as Blanche's siblings Clayton Hollingsworth and Virginia Hollingsworth. Virginia and Blanche were estranged for a long time, until they reconciled in season 1. They became estranged in season 5 after their father's funeral. Clayton is a closeted gay man who had troubled coming out to Blanche, who eventually accepted his orientation when Clayton and his new boyfriend got married.\n* [[Bill Dana]] and [[Nancy Walker]] as Sophia's siblings Angelo and Angela. Dana appears in seven episodes (seasons 3-7), while he also played Sophia's father in a season-four episode. Walker starred in two episodes in season 2.\n* [[Doris Belack]] and [[Dena Dietrich]] as Gloria Petrillo, Dorothy's younger sister who is married to a wealthy man in California. In a two-part episode, she has lost all of her money and becomes romantically involved with Stan, but she eventually comes to think of him as a \"yutz\" and breaks up with him.\n* [[Scott Jacoby (actor)|Scott Jacoby]] as Dorothy's traveling musician son Michael Zbornak.\n* [[Lynnie Greene]] (credited as Lynn Greene) as a younger Dorothy in flashbacks.\n* [[Lisa Jane Persky]] and [[Deena Freeman]], as Dorothy's daughter, Kate Zbornak who is in interior decorator in New York and married to Dennis who is a successful foot doctor.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Creation===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:2em; font-size:95%; color:black; width:35em; max-width:50%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"I was running all over the house grabbing anybody who would listen.

Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role of the feisty mother of character [[Dorothy Zbornak]]. This was due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her Off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985. Getty figured it would be her last chance to find television or film work. She would return home to New York if she was unsuccessful.\n\nCasting director Judith Weiner had seen ''Torch Song Trilogy'' and thought Getty was terrific in it. She was also impressed by Getty's audition for the role of the mother of Steven Keaton (played by actor [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]]) for a guest episode of ''[[Family Ties]]''. Although Getty was impressive, the show's producers went with another actress. Getty came to Weiner's mind soon after when it became time to begin casting of ''The Golden Girls.''<ref>Colucci, Jim. ''Golden Girls Forever''. HarperCollins Publishers Inc, 2016.</ref>\n\nGetty, who went through a three-hour transformation to become Sophia, wore heavy make-up, thick glasses, and a white wig to look the part.<ref name=\"Kinosian\">{{cite book| last=Kinosian| first=Janet| title=Making Up Is Hard to Do| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52AEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA157| accessdate=November 8, 2013| date=February 1, 1988| work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]]| page=157| issn=0279-0483}}</ref> The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-aged women could be young.

During an interview in 1988, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 Fun Facts About 'The Golden Girls'|url = http://mentalfloss.com/article/56215/20-fun-facts-about-golden-girls|website = [[Mental Floss]]|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHired to film the pilot, director Jay Sandrich also became instrumental in helping to cast the roles of Blanche Devereaux and Rose Nylund. Both Rue McClanahan and Betty White came into consideration as the series ''[[Mama's Family]]'', in which the two co-starred, had been canceled by NBC. Originally, producers wanted to cast McClanahan as Rose and White as Blanche. The thinking for this was based on roles they previously played; White portrayed man-hungry [[Sue Ann Nivens]] on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', while McClanahan co-starred as sweet but scatter-brained [[Vivian Harmon]] in ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]''. Eager not to be [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]], they took the suggestion of Sandrich and switched roles last-minute.<ref name=\"ew-2\"/><ref name=\"Bloom\"/>\n\nIn the pilot script, Blanche was described as \"more Southern than [[Blanche DuBois]]\", so McClanahan was perplexed when she was asked by director Sandrich during the filming of the pilot not to use the strong [[Southern American English|southern accent]] she had developed, but to use her natural Oklahoma accent instead.<ref name=\"emmytv\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_DGIgDOg6c| title=Rue McClanahan on Blanche's accent on \"The Golden Girls\"- EMMYTVLEGENDS.org| author=emmytvlegends.org| publisher=YouTube.com| date=June 11, 2010| access-date=September 8, 2018}}</ref> Once the show was picked up for a first season, the new director [[Paul Bogart]] felt exactly the opposite, insisting that McClanahan use a Southern accent. McClanahan deliberately exaggerated her accent, stating \"I played Blanche the way I felt Blanche. She thought an accentuated Southern accent...would be sexy and strong and attractive to men. She wanted to be a southern heroine, like [[Vivien Leigh]]. In fact, that's who I think she thought she was.\"<ref>{{cite book| title=Golden Girls Forever| first=Jim| last=Colucci| publisher=Harper Collins| year=2016| p=34}}</ref>\n\nThough Harris had created the character of Dorothy with a \"Bea Arthur type\" in mind, Littlefield and the producers initially envisioned actress [[Elaine Stritch]] for the part.<ref name=\"Bloom\"/> Stritch's audition flopped, however, and under the impression that Arthur did not want to participate, Harris asked McClanahan if she could persuade Arthur, with whom she worked previously on the CBS sitcom ''Maude'', to take the role. Arthur flipped upon reading the script, but felt hesitant about McClanahan's approach, as she did not \"want to play (their ''Maude'' characters) Maude and Vivian meet Sue Ann Nivens.\" She reconsidered, however, after hearing that McClanahan and White had switched roles.\n\nBea Arthur and Betty White worked well together in shared mutual respect but they did not pursue a personal friendship with one another outside of ''The Golden Girls'' set. Arthur's son, Matthew Saks, later spoke of tension between the two actresses, stating that his mother \"unknowingly carried the attitude that it was fun to have somebody to be angry at...It was almost like Betty became her nemesis, someone she could always roll her eyes about at work.\"<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/bea-arthur-feud-betty-white-golden-girls-138841/?display=listicle| title=Betty White and Bea Arthur's Friends Open Up About Their On-Set Feud| publisher=closerweekly.com}}</ref> Both actresses had dramatically different training and acting backgrounds; Saks commented on White's habit of [[breaking the fourth wall]] to engage and joke with the studio audience during breaks between filming, which Bea Arthur found unprofessional.<ref name=\"Michelle Darrisaw\">{{cite article|  url=https://www.southernliving.com/culture/betty-white-bea-arthur-golden-girls-feud| title=Say It Isn't So, Girls!

Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman were the first head writers of the series and wrote for the show's first four seasons. As head writers, Speer and Grossman, along with Mort Nathan and Barry Fanaro, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing the first season, gave general ideas to lower staff writers, and personally wrote a handful of scripts each season.<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite news| last=Mills| first=Nancy| title='Golden Girls' Polishes Its Scripts: Daily Revisions Geared to Sharpen Story and Hone Those Laugh Lines| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-30/entertainment/ca-11702_1_golden-girls| accessdate=November 8, 2013| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=October 30, 1987}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Marc Sotkin, previously a writer on ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and a producer on fellow Witt/Thomas series ''[[It's a Living (1980 TV series)|It's a Living]]'', assumed head-writing responsibilities, and guided the show (to varying degrees) during what were its final three seasons. Richard Vaczy and Tracy Gamble, previously writers on ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'' and ''[[My Two Dads]]'', also assumed the roles of producers and head writers.

You have a lot of table reads where the actors will mess it up because they don't understand what the characters are doing, or they misinterpret.

This fa\u00e7ade, along with the ''Empty Nest'' house, sustained hurricane damage leading to Disney's 2003 decision to bulldoze the houses of \"Residential Street\" and construct its \"Lights, Motors, Action!\" attraction. The fa\u00e7ade was based on a real house at 245 N. Saltair Avenue in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California]]. Producers used this residence for exterior shots during the first two seasons.<ref>{{Coord|34.066|-118.4474|display=inline|region:GB_scale:5000}}</ref>\n\nThe show's designer, Ed Stephenson, took inspiration from his time living in Florida to design a \"Florida look\" for ''The Golden Girls'' house set. The wooden accents, columns, and doors were painted to mimic [[Taxodium distichum|Bald cypress]] wood, popular in South Florida homes, with [[rattan]] furniture and tropical-printed upholstery chosen for the furniture.<ref>Colucci 2016 p. 317-318</ref>\n\nThe kitchen set seen on ''The Golden Girls'' was originally used on an earlier Witt/Thomas/Harris series, ''[[It Takes Two (American TV series)|It Takes Two]]'', which aired on ABC from 1982 to 1983. However, the exterior backdrop seen through the kitchen window changed from the view of Chicago [[high-rise]]s to palm trees and bushes for the Miami setting. Space was limited on the soundstage, so when the kitchen was off camera it was usually detached from the rest of the set and the space used for something else. The doorway from the living room, with the alcove and baker's shelf just inside, was designed to give the illusion that the actors were walking in and out of the kitchen.<ref>Colucci, 2016 pg. 324</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nCostume designer Judy Evans created distinctive looks for each of the four actresses to suit their character's personalities and to reflect the Florida setting.

The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food. They decided that a separate cook would distract from their friendship. In addition, the character of Sophia had originally been planned as an occasional guest star, but Getty had tested so positively with preview audiences that the producers decided to make her a regular character.<ref>{{cite web| last=Kovalchik |first=Kara |title=7 Things You Might Not Know About The Golden Girls From Mental Floss |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/19134/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-golden-girls/ |accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Finale===\nAfter six consecutive seasons in the top 10, and the seventh season at number 30, ''The Golden Girls'' came to an end when Bea Arthur chose to leave the series. In the hour-long [[series finale]], which aired in May 1992, Dorothy meets and marries Blanche's uncle Lucas ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) and moves to Hollingsworth Manor in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Sophia was to join her, but in the end, she stays behind with the other women in Miami. This led into the spin-off series, ''[[The Golden Palace]]''.\n\nThe series finale of The Golden Girls was watched by 27.2 million viewers.

Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], to Sicilian immigrants Sophia and Salvadore Petrillo, Dorothy became pregnant while still in [[high school]], resulting in a marriage to Stanley Zbornak ([[Herb Edelman]]) [[shotgun wedding|to legitimize the baby]]. Stan and Dorothy eventually moved to Miami, but divorced after 38 years when Stan left her for a young flight attendant. The marriage produced two children; Kate, in her early 20s, and Michael, who was inconsistently aged between his mid-20s and late 30s (Michael was purportedly the cause of the shotgun wedding). In the series' final episode, Dorothy marries Blanche's uncle, Lucas Hollingsworth, and relocates to Atlanta. Arthur also played Dorothy's grandmother, Sophia's mother, in a flashback episode to when they lived in Brooklyn in the 1950s when Dorothy was a young adult (even though two episodes -- \"My Father, my Brother\" and \"The Days and Nights of Sophia Petrillo\" stated that Sophia's mother died when Dorothy was younger). In season one episode seven, Dorothy is stated to be 55.\n* [[Betty White]] as [[Rose Nylund]] (n\u00e9e Lindstr\u00f6m), a [[Norwegian American]] from the small farming town of [[St. Olaf, Minnesota]]. Often slightly naive and known for her humorously peculiar stories of life growing up in her hometown, Rose was happily married to Charlie Nylund, with whom she had five children; daughters Kirsten, Bridget, Gunilla; and sons Adam and Charlie, Jr. Upon Charlie's death, she moved to Miami. She eventually finds work at a grief counseling center, but later switches careers and becomes assistant to consumer reporter Enrique Mas at a local TV station. In later seasons, Rose became romantically involved with college professor Miles Webber. During season six, Webber was placed into the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]], but returned later in the season. Their relationship continued throughout the series and shortly into the sequel series, ''The Golden Palace''.\n* [[Rue McClanahan]] as [[Blanche Devereaux]] (n\u00e9e Hollingsworth), a [[Southern belle]] employed at an art museum. Born into a wealthy family, Blanche grew up as the apple of her father's eye on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Atlanta, Georgia, prior to her relocation to Miami, where she lived with her husband, George, until his death. Their marriage produced six children; daughters Janet and Rebecca; and sons Doug, Biff, Skippy, and Matthew. A widow, Blanche was portrayed as man-hungry and clearly had the most male admirers and stories detailing various sexual encounters over the course of the series.\n* [[Estelle Getty]] as [[Sophia Petrillo]]<!-- If adding maiden name, please cite an episode or reliable source for verifiability -->, Dorothy's mother. Born in [[Sicily]], Sophia moved to New York after fleeing an [[arranged marriage]] to Guido Spirelli. She married Salvadore \"Sal\" Petrillo, with whom she had three children: Dorothy, Gloria, and Phil, a cross-dresser who later dies of a heart attack (episode \"[[Ebbtide's Revenge]]\"). Initially a resident of the Shady Pines retirement home after having a stroke prior to the start of the series, she moved in with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy following a fire at the institution. During the series' run, Sophia married Max Weinstock, but they soon separated. Throughout the series, she held a few part-time jobs, mostly involving food, including as a fast-food worker and an entrepreneur of spaghetti sauce and homemade sandwiches.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Herb Edelman]] as Stanley Zbornak, Dorothy's cheating, freeloading ex-husband who left her to marry a young flight attendant, who later left him. Stan married another woman in season 4, and they divorced off-screen in season 5. Stanley worked as an unsuccessful novelty salesman until he became a successful entrepreneur by inventing a baked potato opener that made him wealthy.\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Miles Webber (or Nicholas Carbone/Samuel Plankmaker) is Rose's professor boyfriend from season 5 onwards. In season 6, Miles reveals he is in the witness protection program and was a bookkeeper for a mobster. Gould also guest-starred once in the first season as Arnie Peterson, Rose's first serious boyfriend after her husband Charlie's death.\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Salvadore Petrillo, Sophia's late husband, who is usually seen in dreams or flashback sequences. Melton also appears as Don the Fool, a waiter at a medieval restaurant in season six.\n* Shawn Schepps and Debra Engle, as Blanche's daughter, Rebecca Devereaux. Initially an overweight former model in an emotionally abusive relationship, she later slimmed down and had a baby girl named Aurora by [[artificial insemination]].\n* [[Monte Markham]] and [[Sheree North]] as Blanche's siblings Clayton Hollingsworth and Virginia Hollingsworth. Virginia and Blanche were estranged for a long time, until they reconciled in season 1. They became estranged in season 5 after their father's funeral. Clayton is a closeted gay man who had troubled coming out to Blanche, who eventually accepted his orientation when Clayton and his new boyfriend got married.\n* [[Bill Dana]] and [[Nancy Walker]] as Sophia's siblings Angelo and Angela. Dana appears in seven episodes (seasons 3-7), while he also played Sophia's father in a season-four episode. Walker starred in two episodes in season 2.\n* [[Doris Belack]] and [[Dena Dietrich]] as Gloria Petrillo, Dorothy's younger sister who is married to a wealthy man in California. In a two-part episode, she has lost all of her money and becomes romantically involved with Stan, but she eventually comes to think of him as a \"yutz\" and breaks up with him.\n* [[Scott Jacoby (actor)|Scott Jacoby]] as Dorothy's traveling musician son Michael Zbornak.\n* [[Lynnie Greene]] (credited as Lynn Greene) as a younger Dorothy in flashbacks.\n* [[Lisa Jane Persky]] and [[Deena Freeman]], as Dorothy's daughter, Kate Zbornak who is in interior decorator in New York and married to Dennis who is a successful foot doctor.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Creation===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:2em; font-size:95%; color:black; width:35em; max-width:50%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"I was running all over the house grabbing anybody who would listen.

Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role of the feisty mother of character [[Dorothy Zbornak]]. This was due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her Off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985. Getty figured it would be her last chance to find television or film work. She would return home to New York if she was unsuccessful.\n\nCasting director Judith Weiner had seen ''Torch Song Trilogy'' and thought Getty was terrific in it. She was also impressed by Getty's audition for the role of the mother of Steven Keaton (played by actor [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]]) for a guest episode of ''[[Family Ties]]''. Although Getty was impressive, the show's producers went with another actress. Getty came to Weiner's mind soon after when it became time to begin casting of ''The Golden Girls.''<ref>Colucci, Jim.

Both Rue McClanahan and Betty White came into consideration as the series ''[[Mama's Family]]'', in which the two co-starred, had been canceled by NBC. Originally, producers wanted to cast McClanahan as Rose and White as Blanche. The thinking for this was based on roles they previously played; White portrayed man-hungry [[Sue Ann Nivens]] on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', while McClanahan co-starred as sweet but scatter-brained [[Vivian Harmon]] in ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]''. Eager not to be [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]], they took the suggestion of Sandrich and switched roles last-minute.<ref name=\"ew-2\"/><ref name=\"Bloom\"/>\n\nIn the pilot script, Blanche was described as \"more Southern than [[Blanche DuBois]]\", so McClanahan was perplexed when she was asked by director Sandrich during the filming of the pilot not to use the strong [[Southern American English|southern accent]] she had developed, but to use her natural Oklahoma accent instead.<ref name=\"emmytv\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_DGIgDOg6c| title=Rue McClanahan on Blanche's accent on \"The Golden Girls\"- EMMYTVLEGENDS.org| author=emmytvlegends.org| publisher=YouTube.com| date=June 11, 2010| access-date=September 8, 2018}}</ref> Once the show was picked up for a first season, the new director [[Paul Bogart]] felt exactly the opposite, insisting that McClanahan use a Southern accent. McClanahan deliberately exaggerated her accent, stating \"I played Blanche the way I felt Blanche. She thought an accentuated Southern accent...would be sexy and strong and attractive to men. She wanted to be a southern heroine, like [[Vivien Leigh]]. In fact, that's who I think she thought she was.\"<ref>{{cite book| title=Golden Girls Forever| first=Jim| last=Colucci| publisher=Harper Collins| year=2016| p=34}}</ref>\n\nThough Harris had created the character of Dorothy with a \"Bea Arthur type\" in mind, Littlefield and the producers initially envisioned actress [[Elaine Stritch]] for the part.<ref name=\"Bloom\"/> Stritch's audition flopped, however, and under the impression that Arthur did not want to participate, Harris asked McClanahan if she could persuade Arthur, with whom she worked previously on the CBS sitcom ''Maude'', to take the role. Arthur flipped upon reading the script, but felt hesitant about McClanahan's approach, as she did not \"want to play (their ''Maude'' characters) Maude and Vivian meet Sue Ann Nivens.\" She reconsidered, however, after hearing that McClanahan and White had switched roles.\n\nBea Arthur and Betty White worked well together in shared mutual respect but they did not pursue a personal friendship with one another outside of ''The Golden Girls'' set. Arthur's son, Matthew Saks, later spoke of tension between the two actresses, stating that his mother \"unknowingly carried the attitude that it was fun to have somebody to be angry at...It was almost like Betty became her nemesis, someone she could always roll her eyes about at work.\"<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/bea-arthur-feud-betty-white-golden-girls-138841/?display=listicle| title=Betty White and Bea Arthur's Friends Open Up About Their On-Set Feud| publisher=closerweekly.com}}</ref> Both actresses had dramatically different training and acting backgrounds; Saks commented on White's habit of [[breaking the fourth wall]] to engage and joke with the studio audience during breaks between filming, which Bea Arthur found unprofessional.<ref name=\"Michelle Darrisaw\">{{cite article|  url=https://www.southernliving.com/culture/betty-white-bea-arthur-golden-girls-feud| title=Say It Isn't So, Girls!

Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman were the first head writers of the series and wrote for the show's first four seasons. As head writers, Speer and Grossman, along with Mort Nathan and Barry Fanaro, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing the first season, gave general ideas to lower staff writers, and personally wrote a handful of scripts each season.<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite news| last=Mills| first=Nancy| title='Golden Girls' Polishes Its Scripts: Daily Revisions Geared to Sharpen Story and Hone Those Laugh Lines| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-30/entertainment/ca-11702_1_golden-girls| accessdate=November 8, 2013| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=October 30, 1987}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Marc Sotkin, previously a writer on ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and a producer on fellow Witt/Thomas series ''[[It's a Living (1980 TV series)|It's a Living]]'', assumed head-writing responsibilities, and guided the show (to varying degrees) during what were its final three seasons.

This fa\u00e7ade, along with the ''Empty Nest'' house, sustained hurricane damage leading to Disney's 2003 decision to bulldoze the houses of \"Residential Street\" and construct its \"Lights, Motors, Action!\" attraction. The fa\u00e7ade was based on a real house at 245 N. Saltair Avenue in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California]]. Producers used this residence for exterior shots during the first two seasons.<ref>{{Coord|34.066|-118.4474|display=inline|region:GB_scale:5000}}</ref>\n\nThe show's designer, Ed Stephenson, took inspiration from his time living in Florida to design a \"Florida look\" for ''The Golden Girls'' house set.

However, the exterior backdrop seen through the kitchen window changed from the view of Chicago [[high-rise]]s to palm trees and bushes for the Miami setting. Space was limited on the soundstage, so when the kitchen was off camera it was usually detached from the rest of the set and the space used for something else. The doorway from the living room, with the alcove and baker's shelf just inside, was designed to give the illusion that the actors were walking in and out of the kitchen.<ref>Colucci, 2016 pg. 324</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nCostume designer Judy Evans created distinctive looks for each of the four actresses to suit their character's personalities and to reflect the Florida setting. According to Evans \"I wanted a sexy, soft, and flowing look for Rue, a tailored, pulled-together look for Bea, a down-home look for Betty, and comfort for Estelle.\"<ref>Colucci, 2016, p. 333</ref> Anna Wyckoff of the [[Costume Designers Guild]] wrote that \"Evans took the direction from the producers to create a vibrant look for the four mature leads, and ran with it...redefining what \u201cdressing your age\u201d looked like.\"<ref>{{cite article| url=https://costumedesignersguild.com/articles-videos/articles-archive/costume-design-costars/| title=The Changing Face of Modern Television: When Costume Design Costars| first=Anna| last=Wyckoff| magazine=The Costume Designer| date=Spring 2012| access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> Many of the character's outfits were designed by Evans and made specially, but there were between seven and ten costume changes per episode between the four actresses, which entailed a great deal of [[off the rack]] shopping.<ref name=\"Colucci, 2016 pg. 333\">Colucci, 2016 pg. 333</ref> Evans generally dressed the actresses in expensive pieces and high quality fabrics, despite the recurring theme that the four characters were struggling with money, because \"The main idea was to make them look good.

Before this, between when Labour MPs were first elected in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] and the general election in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], when substantial gains were made, the post was known as [[Parliamentary Labour Party|Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\">Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, {{ISBN|0-333-92908-X}}</ref> In 1970, the positions of leader of the Labour Party and Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party were separated.\n\nIn 1921, [[John Robert Clynes|J. R. Clynes]] became the first leader of the Labour Party to have been born in [[England]]; prior to this, all party leaders had been born in [[Scotland]]. In [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]], [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], leading a minority administration which lasted nine months. [[Clement Attlee]] would become the first Labour leader to lead a majority government in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]. The first to be born in [[Wales]] was [[Neil Kinnock]], who was elected in [[1983 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|1983]]. The most electorally successful leaders of the Labour Party to date are: [[Tony Blair]], who won three consecutive electoral victories in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] (both landslide victories), and [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], and [[Harold Wilson]], who won three general elections out of five contested, in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].\n\n==Selection==\nUnlike other British political party leaders, the Labour leader does not have the power to dismiss or appoint their deputy. Both the leader and deputy leader are elected by an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] system. From 1980 to 2014 an electoral college was used, with a third of the votes allocated to the Party's [[List of Labour Party (UK) MPs|MPs]] and [[List of members of the European Parliament 2009\u20132014|MEPs]], a third to individual members of the Labour Party, and a third to individual members of all affiliated organisations, including [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] and [[Affiliated trade union|trade unions]]. The [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2015 leadership election]] used a \"one member, one vote\" system, in which the votes of party members and members of affiliated organisations are counted equally. MPs and MEPs votes are not counted separately, although a candidate needs to receive the support of 10% of Labour MPs in order to appear on the ballot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/labour-proposals-all-but-guarantee-leftwing-corbyn-successor/ar-AAzdqmI|title=Labour proposals 'all-but guarantee leftwing Corbyn successor'|website=www.msn.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Role==\nWhen the Labour Party is in [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]], as it currently is, the leader of the Labour Party usually acts as the [[Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], and chairs the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|shadow cabinet]]. Concordantly, when the Party is in [[Her Majesty's Government|government]], the leader would usually become the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister of the United Kingdom]], [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]], as well as appointing the [[Cabinet (UK)|cabinet]].\n\n==Leaders of the Labour Party (1906\u2013present)==\n{{qnote|the right-hand column does not allocate height proportional to time in office.}}\nA list of leaders (including acting leaders) since 1906.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaders of the Labour Party|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/lableader.html|website=election.demon.co.uk|publisher=United Kingdom Election Results|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Before this, between when Labour MPs were first elected in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] and the general election in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], when substantial gains were made, the post was known as [[Parliamentary Labour Party|Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\">Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, {{ISBN|0-333-92908-X}}</ref> In 1970, the positions of leader of the Labour Party and Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party were separated.\n\nIn 1921, [[John Robert Clynes|J. R. Clynes]] became the first leader of the Labour Party to have been born in [[England]]; prior to this, all party leaders had been born in [[Scotland]]. In [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]], [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], leading a minority administration which lasted nine months. [[Clement Attlee]] would become the first Labour leader to lead a majority government in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]. The first to be born in [[Wales]] was [[Neil Kinnock]], who was elected in [[1983 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|1983]]. The most electorally successful leaders of the Labour Party to date are: [[Tony Blair]], who won three consecutive electoral victories in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] (both landslide victories), and [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], and [[Harold Wilson]], who won three general elections out of five contested, in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].\n\n==Selection==\nUnlike other British political party leaders, the Labour leader does not have the power to dismiss or appoint their deputy. Both the leader and deputy leader are elected by an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] system. From 1980 to 2014 an electoral college was used, with a third of the votes allocated to the Party's [[List of Labour Party (UK) MPs|MPs]] and [[List of members of the European Parliament 2009\u20132014|MEPs]], a third to individual members of the Labour Party, and a third to individual members of all affiliated organisations, including [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] and [[Affiliated trade union|trade unions]]. The [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2015 leadership election]] used a \"one member, one vote\" system, in which the votes of party members and members of affiliated organisations are counted equally. MPs and MEPs votes are not counted separately, although a candidate needs to receive the support of 10% of Labour MPs in order to appear on the ballot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/labour-proposals-all-but-guarantee-leftwing-corbyn-successor/ar-AAzdqmI|title=Labour proposals 'all-but guarantee leftwing Corbyn successor'|website=www.msn.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Role==\nWhen the Labour Party is in [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]], as it currently is, the leader of the Labour Party usually acts as the [[Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], and chairs the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|shadow cabinet]]. Concordantly, when the Party is in [[Her Majesty's Government|government]], the leader would usually become the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister of the United Kingdom]], [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]], as well as appointing the [[Cabinet (UK)|cabinet]].\n\n==Leaders of the Labour Party (1906\u2013present)==\n{{qnote|the right-hand column does not allocate height proportional to time in office.}}\nA list of leaders (including acting leaders) since 1906.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaders of the Labour Party|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/lableader.html|website=election.demon.co.uk|publisher=United Kingdom Election Results|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

He headed the Institute of Practical Geometry and Hydrology/Architecture between 1841 and 1848. Later in life, he accepted an appointment to a chair of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Petzval became a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1873.\n\nPetzval is considered to be one of the main founders of [[geometrical optics]], modern [[photography]] and [[cinematography]]. Among his inventions are the [[Petzval lens|Petzval portrait lens]] and [[opera glasses]], both still in common use today. He is also credited with the discovery of the [[Laplace transform]] and is also known for his extensive work on [[aberration in optical systems]].\n\n== Early life ==\nIn 1801, Joseph Petzval's father married the [[Zipser-German]] Susanne Kreutzmann, who was born in Szepesb\u00e9la, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a daughter of the previous teacher at the same school in Szepesb\u00e9la. The couple brought up six children: Gust\u00e1v Adolf (1800&ndash;1803), who died prematurely; Nestor Aemilianus (1804&ndash;1806); Joseph Maximili\u00e1n (1807 - 1891); Petrol Baltaz\u00e1r (1809&ndash;1889); and three daughters. In 1810, the family moved to [[Ke\u017emarok|K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk]] (in German: K\u00e4smark, today Ke\u017emarok, Slovakia) and in 1819 to [[Levo\u010da|L\u0151cse]] (in German: Leutschau, today Levo\u010da, Slovakia).\n\nThe entire family shared an aptitude for technology. Joseph's father worked as a teacher at the evangelical school in Szepesb\u00e9la, as well as an [[organist]] in Szepesb\u00e9la and later in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk. He was also a conductor and a [[geodesy|geodesist]] in L\u0151cse. He had a reputation as an outstanding musician and composer, who was also gifted mechanically. In 1824, he was awarded two patents: one for improvements to the [[pendulum clock]] and the other for a \"polygraph\" ([[typewriter]]). Petzval's brother, Petrol Baltaz\u00e1r Petzval, was a well-respected mathematician, engineer and [[astronomer]].\n\n=== Education ===\n\nJoseph Petzval attended elementary school in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk, and began his secondary school studies in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk and [[Podol\u00ednec|Podolin]] (in German: Pudlein, now Podol\u00ednec, Slovakia). On 1 October 1819 he returned to his family in L\u0151cse, and entered high school. Both in elementary school and high school he ranked among the best in his class in the subjects of [[Latin]] (the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary) and religion; however, he struggled with his [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Before arriving at L\u0151cse, he was also very weak in mathematics. In L\u0151cse, however, he clearly improved in this discipline.\n\nOne anecdote told about Petzval is as follows: When his family had already decided to make a shoemaker out of Petzval, he read the book ''Analytic Paper on the Elements of Mathematics'' by the German mathematician Hauser over the summer holidays, just after completing his fourth class in elementary school. He was preparing to undergo a repeat class in mathematics. After Petzval finished the book, the child who had been a weak math pupil swiftly became a math genius.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Petzval decided to move to the Institutum Geometricum, the engineering faculty of the Pester University. Before that, he had to complete a two-year [[lyceum]], which he attended from 1823 to 1825 in [[Ko\u0161ice|Kassa]] (in German: Kaschau, today Ko\u0161ice, [[Slovakia]]). When he arrived there in 1823, Petzval was already well-versed in the subjects of Latin, mathematical analysis, classical literature and stylistics. In addition to his [[Slovak language|Slovak]] he was able to speak perfectly in Czech, German and Hungarian. With his father's assistance, he also learned French and English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neue-zeitung.hu/dokumentumok/nzg_032008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112204/http://www.neue-zeitung.hu/dokumentumok/nzg_032008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Further studies and career ==\n\nAfter completing the Lyceum, Petzval worked for a year as an educator for Count Alm\u00e1ssy in the [[Heves (former county)|Heves county]]. In addition to bringing in some urgently needed money, this experience also provided him with important social contacts.\n\nFrom 1826 to 1828, Petzval studied at the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Institutum Geometricum]] in [[Buda]], and earned an engineering diploma in 1828. In the same year, he joined the graduate degree program of the university, and became the self-appointed adjunct chair for the Physics Department (in 1831). From 1828 to 1835, Petzval simultaneously worked as an [[Urban engineering|urban engineer]] for the city of Buda\u2014particularly as a specialist in flood abatement and sewers\u2014and studied mathematics, mechanics and practical geometry. He authored an unrealized plan to build a navigation channel around Buda. In 1830, his dam computations saved the city from an inundation caused by the flooding of the [[Danube]]. After he received his Ph.D. in 1832, he taught as an associate professor at the university. During this period, he also received a degree in mathematics. In 1835, he was appointed a university professor in higher mathematics.\n\nAfter being invited to the University of Vienna in 1836, Petzval accepted a position of the chair of mathematics there in 1837, and worked until 1877 as a professor of mathematics. Apart from mathematics, he was also concerned with mechanics, ballistics, optics, and acoustics. His lectures on the theory of algebraic equations, which integrated linear and differential equations with constant and variable coefficients, ballistics, acoustic theory, and other areas were high quality and became well attended.\n\nPetzval moved into a rented abandoned monastery at [[Kahlenberg]] mountain. He founded his own glass-sharpening workshop there. His lenses became world-famous because Petzval was also a skillful lens sharpener and precision mechanic.\n\nIn 1840, he designed his famous portrait lens. 1845 brought disputes with the entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtl\u00e4nder (1812&ndash;1878) over who had the right to produce Petzval's lenses. In 1859, Petzval's home was broken into, and his manuscripts &mdash; a result of many years of research &mdash; were destroyed. Petzval never managed to reconstruct the lost documents. His most refined technical book on optics, lost with his manuscripts, would never appear in print. From then on, he primarily concerned himself with acoustics and began to withdraw from society. His enterprise with Carl Dietzler failed in 1862 (see further below); Dietzler died in 1872.\n\nIn 1869, at the age of 62, Petzval married his housekeeper, but she died four years later. In 1877, he stopped lecturing, withdrew to a monastery on Kahlenberg, and became a [[hermit]].\n\n[[File:Grave Josef Petzval.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Petzval's grave]]\nPetzval died in Vienna in 1891, nearly forgotten, embittered, and destitute. His grave is in the Viennese central cemetery. His bitterness at the end of his life can probably be traced, on the one hand, to his continuing controversy with Voigtl\u00e4nder, the loss of his manuscripts, and his business failure; and on the other hand, to the fact that he was never really acknowledged for his lifelong work in the field of optics. Just before his death, Petzval was reported to have said:\n\n:\"''I defeated the light, I have it firmly in hand, because there is much darkness in the world too.''\"\n\n===Private life and hobbies===\nPetzval was a good sportsman and rider. As a young child, he often traveled with his family to the [[High Tatras]], and was also a dedicated athlete. In Vienna, he was for a long time the best fencer and ring fighter in the city. He also inherited an excellent talent for music from his father. Allegedly, while he was a lecturer in Vienna, he always rode to his lectures on a black Arabian horse.\n\nPetzval never wanted to communicate anything about his private life, and was therefore relatively inscrutable to others during his lifetime. As Dr. Ermenyi described in his book, ''Dr. Josef Petzval's Life''\n\n:\"''. . . he went so far as to always insert a bare point, for example, use the appearing annual yearbook of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, in whatever apart from the names of the members the date and the place appear aforementioned to the birth for itself into this column.''\"\n\n<!--In addition, it had a slope to the zurueckgezogenheit. -->At the end of his life he lived in increasingly greater isolation in his \"castle\" on Kahlenberg, with only his horse for company, although several academies and scholarly societies appointed him a member (member of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1846/1849), external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1873), honorary member of the Union of the Czech mathematicians and physicists (1881), carriers of the French Charles Chevalier Platinmedaille, and others).\n\n===Disputes===\nPetzval placed very high requirements on himself and others. That was probably connected with his critical, contentious and sarcastic nature, which brought him many conflicts, particularly in the field of mathematics.\n\nPetzval had a controversy with [[Christian Doppler]] over problems of acoustics, and Doppler responded in 1852 with a book entitled \"Remarks Over the Objections Stated by Professor Petzval Against the Correctness of My Theory\".\n\nIn particular he was involved in lengthy disputes with the entrepreneur Voigtl\u00e4nder. These began in 1845, when Petzval raised the issue of fraud for the first time. Because Petzval only held a patent in Austria, Voigtl\u00e4nder shifted his production to [[Braunschweig]] in [[German Confederation|Germany]], where he produced about 60,000 Petzval lenses in the following 20 years. Petzval for his part co-operated since 1854 with the Austrian optics producer Dietzler. The latter's lenses were marketed in Austria as the \"photographic [[Dialyte lens|Dialyt]]\", while Voigtl\u00e4nder marketed the lenses in Germany and Austria as the \"Voightl\u00e4nder Orthoskop\". After further interference by Voigtl\u00e4nder, Dietzler went bankrupt in 1862. When Petzval threatened legal action, Voigtl\u00e4nder closed his Austrian plant in 1866. Petzval could have then transferred the marketing, but he had renounced working with optics after his home was robbed in 1859 and worked instead on acoustics. In 1862, he also stopped lecturing on optics.\n\n==Discoveries and inventions==\n\n===Optics===\n[[Image:Lens Petval 1841.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of Petzval's 1841 portrait lens - crown glass shaded pink, flint glass shaded blue]]\n[[Image:Petzval.png|thumb|right|200px|Petzval lenses]]\n[[Image:Petzval1.png|thumb|right|200px|Modern Petzval objective lenses from a projector]]\nPetzval's greatest achievements lie in his work with [[geometric optics]]. In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] presented the [[Daguerreotype]], the first commercially successful photographic process. [[Fox Talbot]]'s [[calotype]] was discovered earlier but did not enjoy commercial success. Petzval learned of the invention from his friend, Viennese professor [[Andreas von Ettingshausen]]. The daguerreotype was problematic in that it required exposure times as long as 30 minutes to create a portrait. With Ettingshausen's urging, Petzval set up a workshop and laboratory at [[Kahlenberg]] in [[Vienna]] and, after six months of complex computations, produced designs for improved objective lenses for both portraiture and [[landscape photography]]. Because the [[artillery]] was one of the few occupations that used advanced mathematical computations at the time, [[Archduke Louis of Austria|Archduke Ludwig]] lent eight artillery cannoners and three corporals to the computational efforts. The calculations these men carried out in tandem with each other have been regarded as an early (albeit human) example of a [[parallel computer]].\n\nPetzval's portrait objective lens (''[[Petzval lens|Petzval Portr\u00e4tobjektiv]]'') was an almost distortionless ''Anachromatischer vierlinser'' (double achromatic objective lens, with four lenses in three groups). The luminous intensity of this flat \"portrait lens\" was substantially higher than the daguerre standard of 1839, the Wollaston Chevalier lens ({{f/|16|link=yes}}). The screen {{f/|3.6}} with a focal length of 160&nbsp;mm made crucially shorter exposure times possible \u2014 using exposures of only about 15 to 30 seconds compared to the 10 minutes previously. Thus, snapshots became possible for the first time.\n\nThe portrait objective lens consisted of a cemented double lens in front ({{f/|5}}) and a double lens with a gap in the back. The rear double lens was necessary for the correction of spherical and coma errors. The Chevalier lens used two cemented double lenses, but was immediately replaced by the Petzval lens, so that the Petzval ''Portr\u00e4tlinse'' was the first cemented lens in widespread use. The first portrait objective lenses were rather small and had a diameter of 2.6&nbsp;cm. The 1856 Petzval lenses produced by Dietzler had a diameter of 15&nbsp;cm and a weight of 15&nbsp;kg, with which one could make portraits measuring 33 by 42&nbsp;cm. [http://www.telescope-optics.net/curvature.htm]\n\nIn 1840, Petzval allowed the Viennese entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] to produce the lens for a one-time payment of 2,000 guldens, without a patent or a contract, which led later to a lasting controversy between Petzval and Voigtl\u00e4nder. Voigtl\u00e4nder, who had confirmed the process through his own calculations, produced a prototype in May 1840 and began production of the lens for the daguerrotype cameras in 1841, making a fortune in the process. The [[thermionic camera]]s were made from brass, using round daguerreotype plates which exposed a diameter of 8&nbsp;cm. In 1841, 600 of these cameras were manufactured and sold at a price of 120 guldens. Voigtl\u00e4nder received a medal at the world exhibition in Paris for this achievement. These first metal-body cameras were prototypes of today's modern cameras. It took another 50 years until an improved camera became available. Petzval's portrait objective lens was used into the 1920s (often under other names) in cameras and is used today in projectors. The lens played an important role in the development of photography and cinematography.\n\nEven with all its apparent improvements, Petzval was dissatisfied with the lens and, after some improvements, left it for others to produce and patent. The camera with the new landscape objective, produced by Dietzler, possessed a light foldable chamber with double bellows. Petzval never made a commercial profit from the lens.\n\nAmong Petzval's other works are the invention of opera glasses, lens system calculations that led to the perfection of a telescope and microscope (1843), computations for efficient binoculars, and construction of new floodlights (1847). His plan for the construction of lighting systems for ships on the [[Danube]] could not be carried out, however. His special mirror lamp (Petzval lamp), which made possible a maximum utilization of light energy, was used particularly for the bright projectors developed by Petzval. Petzval can also be regarded as the inventor of the modern unastigmatic lens system, based on records from his estate. About 1860, Petzval conducted [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]]  measurements using equipment he had designed. He also proved scientifically that glowing solid compounds emit more light than burning gases. [[Carl Auer von Welsbach|Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach]] later applied this principle to the gas lamp he designed.\n\nPetzval's achievements are used today in cinematography, [[astronomy]], and meteorology. The ''Astro-Petzval-Objektiv'' lens is used in astronomy. This objective made a distortion-free illustration of a large part of the sky, as well as permitting photographing of galaxies and star fields. German optics companies (T\u00f6pfer, Voigtl\u00e4nderkorrigie, [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]]) produced the Petzval objective lens until the 1940s. Petzval's largest contributions to optics are his theoretical bases for the construction and correction of optical lens systems. He carried out fundamental work for the theory of aberration in optical systems. A few central terms of this field were later named after Petzval:\n\n* The ''Petzval surface'' is the generally curved image plane of an unadjusted optical system.\n* In the case of adherence to the Petzval condition the Petzval surface is even.\n\nTo the regret of physicists, Petzval never released a prepared multi-volume optical work.\n\n===Mathematics===\nIn mathematics, Petzval stressed practical applicability. He said, \"Mankind does not exist for science's sake, but science should be used to improve the conditions of mankind.\" He worked on applications of the [[Laplace]] transformation. Arguably it could be called the \"Petzval transformation\", since he was the first to study it and its applications in usual linear differential equations systematically. His work was very thorough, but not completely satisfying, since he could not use an edge integration in order to invert the transformation. Petzval wrote a paper in two volumes as well as a long work on this subject. A controversy with the student Simon Spritzer, who accused Petzval of plagiarism of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], led the Spritzer-influenced mathematicians [[George Boole]] and [[Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9]] to later name the transformation after Laplace. Petzval tried to represent practically everything in his environment mathematically. Thus he tried to mathematically model fencing or the course of the horse. His obsession with mathematics finally led to the discovery of the portrait objective.\n\n===Acoustics===\nIn the study of [[acoustics]], Petzval was particularly concerned with [[String instrument|string]] [[oscillation]]s, differential equations of the string oscillations, and the mathematical theory of musical instruments. He designed a piano with three key sequences. Petzval developed a theory of the oscillations of strained strings as well as his own theory of tone systems.\n\n==Memorials==\n\nThe Jozef Maximili\u00e1n Petzval Museum of the History of Photography and Cinematography, part of the [[Slovak Technical Museum]] of Ko\u0161ice, is located in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Bel\u00e1, in the house where Petzval was born. The crater [[Petzval (crater)|Petzval]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] is named after him, as are roads and statues in modern Slovakia, [[Austria]], and Hungary.\n\nIn 1980 a [[planetoid]] (3716 Petzval, 1980 TG) was named after Petzval upon the request of the astronomical institute in [[Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica]] and Czech scientists; Petzval's portrait objective lens made possible the discovery of many planetoids at the end of the 19th century. The Austrian Board of Education has bestowed the \"Petzval Medal\" for special achievements in the area of scientific photography since 1928.\n\n==Ethnicity and name==\nThe Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia ''Acta technica, Volume 25, 1959'' notes a dispute over the ethnicity of Petzval. According to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: \n{{Quote|''\"The [[Austria]]ns declared Petzval to having been an Austrian, the [[Czech people|Czechs]] tried to prove his [[Bohemian]] origin, the [[Slovaks]] claiming to the fact that the [[Szepes county|County of Szepes]], where Petzval was born, is now in [[Slovakia]], so he must have been a Slovak.\"''|[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]],<ref name=\"Akad\u00e9mia1959\">{{cite book|author=Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia|title=Acta technica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6UIAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=1 January 1959|publisher=[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Magyar Tudomo\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia]]}}</ref>}}\n\nThe same publication also cites Petzval's expressed claim to being Hungarian and a ''\"...loyal son of the fatherland\"''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6UIAQAAIAAJ&q=Petzval#search_anchor Acta technica, page 215]</ref>\nAs mentioned earlier, he struggled with Hungarian language while at school, since it was not his mother tongue. \nPetzvals contemporaries widely accepted that he was Hungarian, as Petzval always proclaimed. \"He lived 54 years of his life in Vienna, but could not become, and did not become a Viennese - devotedly to his native country, he remained a Hungarian.\" - told Lueger, mayor of Vienna, at Petzval's burial.<ref>[http://maimanohaz.blog.hu/2012/08/17/petzval_jozsef_1807#  Petzval J\u00f3zsef, Mai Man\u00f3 H\u00e1z Photography Museum, Budapest]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* ''Bericht \u00fcber die Ergebnisse einiger dioptrischen Untersuchungen'' ([[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], 1843)\n* ''Eigenschaften einer guten Camera-Obscura'' ([[Wien]], 1847)\n* ''Integration der linearen Differenzialgleichungen mit Constanten und ver\u00e4nderlichen Coefficienten, I\u2013II.''

He headed the Institute of Practical Geometry and Hydrology/Architecture between 1841 and 1848. Later in life, he accepted an appointment to a chair of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Petzval became a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1873.\n\nPetzval is considered to be one of the main founders of [[geometrical optics]], modern [[photography]] and [[cinematography]]. Among his inventions are the [[Petzval lens|Petzval portrait lens]] and [[opera glasses]], both still in common use today. He is also credited with the discovery of the [[Laplace transform]] and is also known for his extensive work on [[aberration in optical systems]].\n\n== Early life ==\nIn 1801, Joseph Petzval's father married the [[Zipser-German]] Susanne Kreutzmann, who was born in Szepesb\u00e9la, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a daughter of the previous teacher at the same school in Szepesb\u00e9la. The couple brought up six children: Gust\u00e1v Adolf (1800&ndash;1803), who died prematurely; Nestor Aemilianus (1804&ndash;1806); Joseph Maximili\u00e1n (1807 - 1891); Petrol Baltaz\u00e1r (1809&ndash;1889); and three daughters. In 1810, the family moved to [[Ke\u017emarok|K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk]] (in German: K\u00e4smark, today Ke\u017emarok, Slovakia) and in 1819 to [[Levo\u010da|L\u0151cse]] (in German: Leutschau, today Levo\u010da, Slovakia).\n\nThe entire family shared an aptitude for technology. Joseph's father worked as a teacher at the evangelical school in Szepesb\u00e9la, as well as an [[organist]] in Szepesb\u00e9la and later in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk. He was also a conductor and a [[geodesy|geodesist]] in L\u0151cse. He had a reputation as an outstanding musician and composer, who was also gifted mechanically. In 1824, he was awarded two patents: one for improvements to the [[pendulum clock]] and the other for a \"polygraph\" ([[typewriter]]). Petzval's brother, Petrol Baltaz\u00e1r Petzval, was a well-respected mathematician, engineer and [[astronomer]].\n\n=== Education ===\n\nJoseph Petzval attended elementary school in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk, and began his secondary school studies in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk and [[Podol\u00ednec|Podolin]] (in German: Pudlein, now Podol\u00ednec, Slovakia). On 1 October 1819 he returned to his family in L\u0151cse, and entered high school. Both in elementary school and high school he ranked among the best in his class in the subjects of [[Latin]] (the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary) and religion; however, he struggled with his [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Before arriving at L\u0151cse, he was also very weak in mathematics. In L\u0151cse, however, he clearly improved in this discipline.\n\nOne anecdote told about Petzval is as follows: When his family had already decided to make a shoemaker out of Petzval, he read the book ''Analytic Paper on the Elements of Mathematics'' by the German mathematician Hauser over the summer holidays, just after completing his fourth class in elementary school. He was preparing to undergo a repeat class in mathematics. After Petzval finished the book, the child who had been a weak math pupil swiftly became a math genius.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Petzval decided to move to the Institutum Geometricum, the engineering faculty of the Pester University. Before that, he had to complete a two-year [[lyceum]], which he attended from 1823 to 1825 in [[Ko\u0161ice|Kassa]] (in German: Kaschau, today Ko\u0161ice, [[Slovakia]]). When he arrived there in 1823, Petzval was already well-versed in the subjects of Latin, mathematical analysis, classical literature and stylistics. In addition to his [[Slovak language|Slovak]] he was able to speak perfectly in Czech, German and Hungarian. With his father's assistance, he also learned French and English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neue-zeitung.hu/dokumentumok/nzg_032008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112204/http://www.neue-zeitung.hu/dokumentumok/nzg_032008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Further studies and career ==\n\nAfter completing the Lyceum, Petzval worked for a year as an educator for Count Alm\u00e1ssy in the [[Heves (former county)|Heves county]]. In addition to bringing in some urgently needed money, this experience also provided him with important social contacts.\n\nFrom 1826 to 1828, Petzval studied at the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Institutum Geometricum]] in [[Buda]], and earned an engineering diploma in 1828. In the same year, he joined the graduate degree program of the university, and became the self-appointed adjunct chair for the Physics Department (in 1831). From 1828 to 1835, Petzval simultaneously worked as an [[Urban engineering|urban engineer]] for the city of Buda\u2014particularly as a specialist in flood abatement and sewers\u2014and studied mathematics, mechanics and practical geometry. He authored an unrealized plan to build a navigation channel around Buda. In 1830, his dam computations saved the city from an inundation caused by the flooding of the [[Danube]]. After he received his Ph.D. in 1832, he taught as an associate professor at the university. During this period, he also received a degree in mathematics. In 1835, he was appointed a university professor in higher mathematics.\n\nAfter being invited to the University of Vienna in 1836, Petzval accepted a position of the chair of mathematics there in 1837, and worked until 1877 as a professor of mathematics. Apart from mathematics, he was also concerned with mechanics, ballistics, optics, and acoustics. His lectures on the theory of algebraic equations, which integrated linear and differential equations with constant and variable coefficients, ballistics, acoustic theory, and other areas were high quality and became well attended.\n\nPetzval moved into a rented abandoned monastery at [[Kahlenberg]] mountain. He founded his own glass-sharpening workshop there. His lenses became world-famous because Petzval was also a skillful lens sharpener and precision mechanic.\n\nIn 1840, he designed his famous portrait lens. 1845 brought disputes with the entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtl\u00e4nder (1812&ndash;1878) over who had the right to produce Petzval's lenses. In 1859, Petzval's home was broken into, and his manuscripts &mdash; a result of many years of research &mdash; were destroyed. Petzval never managed to reconstruct the lost documents. His most refined technical book on optics, lost with his manuscripts, would never appear in print. From then on, he primarily concerned himself with acoustics and began to withdraw from society. His enterprise with Carl Dietzler failed in 1862 (see further below); Dietzler died in 1872.\n\nIn 1869, at the age of 62, Petzval married his housekeeper, but she died four years later. In 1877, he stopped lecturing, withdrew to a monastery on Kahlenberg, and became a [[hermit]].\n\n[[File:Grave Josef Petzval.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Petzval's grave]]\nPetzval died in Vienna in 1891, nearly forgotten, embittered, and destitute. His grave is in the Viennese central cemetery. His bitterness at the end of his life can probably be traced, on the one hand, to his continuing controversy with Voigtl\u00e4nder, the loss of his manuscripts, and his business failure; and on the other hand, to the fact that he was never really acknowledged for his lifelong work in the field of optics. Just before his death, Petzval was reported to have said:\n\n:\"''I defeated the light, I have it firmly in hand, because there is much darkness in the world too.''\"\n\n===Private life and hobbies===\nPetzval was a good sportsman and rider. As a young child, he often traveled with his family to the [[High Tatras]], and was also a dedicated athlete. In Vienna, he was for a long time the best fencer and ring fighter in the city. He also inherited an excellent talent for music from his father. Allegedly, while he was a lecturer in Vienna, he always rode to his lectures on a black Arabian horse.\n\nPetzval never wanted to communicate anything about his private life, and was therefore relatively inscrutable to others during his lifetime. As Dr. Ermenyi described in his book, ''Dr. Josef Petzval's Life''\n\n:\"''. . . he went so far as to always insert a bare point, for example, use the appearing annual yearbook of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, in whatever apart from the names of the members the date and the place appear aforementioned to the birth for itself into this column.''\"\n\n<!--In addition, it had a slope to the zurueckgezogenheit. -->At the end of his life he lived in increasingly greater isolation in his \"castle\" on Kahlenberg, with only his horse for company, although several academies and scholarly societies appointed him a member (member of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1846/1849), external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1873), honorary member of the Union of the Czech mathematicians and physicists (1881), carriers of the French Charles Chevalier Platinmedaille, and others).\n\n===Disputes===\nPetzval placed very high requirements on himself and others. That was probably connected with his critical, contentious and sarcastic nature, which brought him many conflicts, particularly in the field of mathematics.\n\nPetzval had a controversy with [[Christian Doppler]] over problems of acoustics, and Doppler responded in 1852 with a book entitled \"Remarks Over the Objections Stated by Professor Petzval Against the Correctness of My Theory\".\n\nIn particular he was involved in lengthy disputes with the entrepreneur Voigtl\u00e4nder. These began in 1845, when Petzval raised the issue of fraud for the first time. Because Petzval only held a patent in Austria, Voigtl\u00e4nder shifted his production to [[Braunschweig]] in [[German Confederation|Germany]], where he produced about 60,000 Petzval lenses in the following 20 years. Petzval for his part co-operated since 1854 with the Austrian optics producer Dietzler. The latter's lenses were marketed in Austria as the \"photographic [[Dialyte lens|Dialyt]]\", while Voigtl\u00e4nder marketed the lenses in Germany and Austria as the \"Voightl\u00e4nder Orthoskop\". After further interference by Voigtl\u00e4nder, Dietzler went bankrupt in 1862. When Petzval threatened legal action, Voigtl\u00e4nder closed his Austrian plant in 1866. Petzval could have then transferred the marketing, but he had renounced working with optics after his home was robbed in 1859 and worked instead on acoustics. In 1862, he also stopped lecturing on optics.\n\n==Discoveries and inventions==\n\n===Optics===\n[[Image:Lens Petval 1841.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of Petzval's 1841 portrait lens - crown glass shaded pink, flint glass shaded blue]]\n[[Image:Petzval.png|thumb|right|200px|Petzval lenses]]\n[[Image:Petzval1.png|thumb|right|200px|Modern Petzval objective lenses from a projector]]\nPetzval's greatest achievements lie in his work with [[geometric optics]]. In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] presented the [[Daguerreotype]], the first commercially successful photographic process. [[Fox Talbot]]'s [[calotype]] was discovered earlier but did not enjoy commercial success. Petzval learned of the invention from his friend, Viennese professor [[Andreas von Ettingshausen]]. The daguerreotype was problematic in that it required exposure times as long as 30 minutes to create a portrait. With Ettingshausen's urging, Petzval set up a workshop and laboratory at [[Kahlenberg]] in [[Vienna]] and, after six months of complex computations, produced designs for improved objective lenses for both portraiture and [[landscape photography]]. Because the [[artillery]] was one of the few occupations that used advanced mathematical computations at the time, [[Archduke Louis of Austria|Archduke Ludwig]] lent eight artillery cannoners and three corporals to the computational efforts. The calculations these men carried out in tandem with each other have been regarded as an early (albeit human) example of a [[parallel computer]].\n\nPetzval's portrait objective lens (''[[Petzval lens|Petzval Portr\u00e4tobjektiv]]'') was an almost distortionless ''Anachromatischer vierlinser'' (double achromatic objective lens, with four lenses in three groups). The luminous intensity of this flat \"portrait lens\" was substantially higher than the daguerre standard of 1839, the Wollaston Chevalier lens ({{f/|16|link=yes}}). The screen {{f/|3.6}} with a focal length of 160&nbsp;mm made crucially shorter exposure times possible \u2014 using exposures of only about 15 to 30 seconds compared to the 10 minutes previously. Thus, snapshots became possible for the first time.\n\nThe portrait objective lens consisted of a cemented double lens in front ({{f/|5}}) and a double lens with a gap in the back. The rear double lens was necessary for the correction of spherical and coma errors. The Chevalier lens used two cemented double lenses, but was immediately replaced by the Petzval lens, so that the Petzval ''Portr\u00e4tlinse'' was the first cemented lens in widespread use. The first portrait objective lenses were rather small and had a diameter of 2.6&nbsp;cm. The 1856 Petzval lenses produced by Dietzler had a diameter of 15&nbsp;cm and a weight of 15&nbsp;kg, with which one could make portraits measuring 33 by 42&nbsp;cm. [http://www.telescope-optics.net/curvature.htm]\n\nIn 1840, Petzval allowed the Viennese entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] to produce the lens for a one-time payment of 2,000 guldens, without a patent or a contract, which led later to a lasting controversy between Petzval and Voigtl\u00e4nder. Voigtl\u00e4nder, who had confirmed the process through his own calculations, produced a prototype in May 1840 and began production of the lens for the daguerrotype cameras in 1841, making a fortune in the process. The [[thermionic camera]]s were made from brass, using round daguerreotype plates which exposed a diameter of 8&nbsp;cm. In 1841, 600 of these cameras were manufactured and sold at a price of 120 guldens. Voigtl\u00e4nder received a medal at the world exhibition in Paris for this achievement. These first metal-body cameras were prototypes of today's modern cameras. It took another 50 years until an improved camera became available. Petzval's portrait objective lens was used into the 1920s (often under other names) in cameras and is used today in projectors. The lens played an important role in the development of photography and cinematography.\n\nEven with all its apparent improvements, Petzval was dissatisfied with the lens and, after some improvements, left it for others to produce and patent. The camera with the new landscape objective, produced by Dietzler, possessed a light foldable chamber with double bellows. Petzval never made a commercial profit from the lens.\n\nAmong Petzval's other works are the invention of opera glasses, lens system calculations that led to the perfection of a telescope and microscope (1843), computations for efficient binoculars, and construction of new floodlights (1847). His plan for the construction of lighting systems for ships on the [[Danube]] could not be carried out, however. His special mirror lamp (Petzval lamp), which made possible a maximum utilization of light energy, was used particularly for the bright projectors developed by Petzval. Petzval can also be regarded as the inventor of the modern unastigmatic lens system, based on records from his estate. About 1860, Petzval conducted [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]]  measurements using equipment he had designed. He also proved scientifically that glowing solid compounds emit more light than burning gases. [[Carl Auer von Welsbach|Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach]] later applied this principle to the gas lamp he designed.\n\nPetzval's achievements are used today in cinematography, [[astronomy]], and meteorology. The ''Astro-Petzval-Objektiv'' lens is used in astronomy. This objective made a distortion-free illustration of a large part of the sky, as well as permitting photographing of galaxies and star fields. German optics companies (T\u00f6pfer, Voigtl\u00e4nderkorrigie, [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]]) produced the Petzval objective lens until the 1940s. Petzval's largest contributions to optics are his theoretical bases for the construction and correction of optical lens systems. He carried out fundamental work for the theory of aberration in optical systems. A few central terms of this field were later named after Petzval:\n\n* The ''Petzval surface'' is the generally curved image plane of an unadjusted optical system.\n* In the case of adherence to the Petzval condition the Petzval surface is even.\n\nTo the regret of physicists, Petzval never released a prepared multi-volume optical work.\n\n===Mathematics===\nIn mathematics, Petzval stressed practical applicability. He said, \"Mankind does not exist for science's sake, but science should be used to improve the conditions of mankind.\" He worked on applications of the [[Laplace]] transformation. Arguably it could be called the \"Petzval transformation\", since he was the first to study it and its applications in usual linear differential equations systematically. His work was very thorough, but not completely satisfying, since he could not use an edge integration in order to invert the transformation. Petzval wrote a paper in two volumes as well as a long work on this subject. A controversy with the student Simon Spritzer, who accused Petzval of plagiarism of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], led the Spritzer-influenced mathematicians [[George Boole]] and [[Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9]] to later name the transformation after Laplace. Petzval tried to represent practically everything in his environment mathematically. Thus he tried to mathematically model fencing or the course of the horse. His obsession with mathematics finally led to the discovery of the portrait objective.\n\n===Acoustics===\nIn the study of [[acoustics]], Petzval was particularly concerned with [[String instrument|string]] [[oscillation]]s, differential equations of the string oscillations, and the mathematical theory of musical instruments. He designed a piano with three key sequences. Petzval developed a theory of the oscillations of strained strings as well as his own theory of tone systems.\n\n==Memorials==\n\nThe Jozef Maximili\u00e1n Petzval Museum of the History of Photography and Cinematography, part of the [[Slovak Technical Museum]] of Ko\u0161ice, is located in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Bel\u00e1, in the house where Petzval was born. The crater [[Petzval (crater)|Petzval]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] is named after him, as are roads and statues in modern Slovakia, [[Austria]], and Hungary.\n\nIn 1980 a [[planetoid]] (3716 Petzval, 1980 TG) was named after Petzval upon the request of the astronomical institute in [[Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica]] and Czech scientists; Petzval's portrait objective lens made possible the discovery of many planetoids at the end of the 19th century. The Austrian Board of Education has bestowed the \"Petzval Medal\" for special achievements in the area of scientific photography since 1928.\n\n==Ethnicity and name==\nThe Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia ''Acta technica, Volume 25, 1959'' notes a dispute over the ethnicity of Petzval. According to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: \n{{Quote|''\"The [[Austria]]ns declared Petzval to having been an Austrian, the [[Czech people|Czechs]] tried to prove his [[Bohemian]] origin, the [[Slovaks]] claiming to the fact that the [[Szepes county|County of Szepes]], where Petzval was born, is now in [[Slovakia]], so he must have been a Slovak.\"''|[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]],<ref name=\"Akad\u00e9mia1959\">{{cite book|author=Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia|title=Acta technica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6UIAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=1 January 1959|publisher=[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Magyar Tudomo\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia]]}}</ref>}}\n\nThe same publication also cites Petzval's expressed claim to being Hungarian and a ''\"...loyal son of the fatherland\"''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6UIAQAAIAAJ&q=Petzval#search_anchor Acta technica, page 215]</ref>\nAs mentioned earlier, he struggled with Hungarian language while at school, since it was not his mother tongue. \nPetzvals contemporaries widely accepted that he was Hungarian, as Petzval always proclaimed. \"He lived 54 years of his life in Vienna, but could not become, and did not become a Viennese - devotedly to his native country, he remained a Hungarian.\" - told Lueger, mayor of Vienna, at Petzval's burial.<ref>[http://maimanohaz.blog.hu/2012/08/17/petzval_jozsef_1807#  Petzval J\u00f3zsef, Mai Man\u00f3 H\u00e1z Photography Museum, Budapest]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* ''Bericht \u00fcber die Ergebnisse einiger dioptrischen Untersuchungen'' ([[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], 1843)\n* ''Eigenschaften einer guten Camera-Obscura'' ([[Wien]], 1847)\n* ''Integration der linearen Differenzialgleichungen mit Constanten und ver\u00e4nderlichen Coefficienten, I\u2013II.''

Maraba's coffee plants are the [[Bourbon coffee|Bourbon variety]] of the ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' species and are grown on fertile [[Volcano#Effects of volcanoes|volcanic soils]] on high-altitude hills. The [[Coffea|fruit]] is handpicked, mostly during the [[rainy season]] between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the [[coffee bean]]s are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.\n\nThe beans are sold to various roasting companies, with the best beans going to [[Union Hand - Roasted Coffee|Union Coffee Roasters]] of the United Kingdom, who produce a [[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade-certified]] brand and [[Community Coffee]] of the United States. Rwanda Specialty Coffee Roasters buys from Maraba and sells to the domestic market. Maraba coffee is also brewed into a [[beer]].\n\nAbout 2,000 [[smallholding|smallholder]] farmers grow the [[Coffea|coffee plants]] under the ''Abahuzamugambi'' [[cooperative]], founded in 1999.

This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.<ref name=\"VSO p8\"/>\n\nThe technicians start the [[Coffee processing#Wet process|washing process]] immediately, since delay can cause [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination of the coffee flavour.<ref name=\"VSO p9\">{{cite web |author=Voluntary Service Overseas |year=2004 |title=Coffee, Fairtrade & Rwanda |authorlink=Voluntary Service Overseas |url=http://www.vso.org.uk/thecoffeeproject/pdfs/coffee_english.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326051322/http://www.vso.org.uk/thecoffeeproject/pdfs/coffee_english.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2015-03-25 |p=9}}</ref> The beans are first thrown into a deep tank.

The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them in the same way as the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than speciality-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating [[colander]]. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient.<ref name=\"VSO p9\"/> This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types.

This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.<ref name=\"VSO p8\"/>\n\nThe technicians start the [[Coffee processing#Wet process|washing process]] immediately, since delay can cause [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination of the coffee flavour.<ref name=\"VSO p9\">{{cite web |author=Voluntary Service Overseas |year=2004 |title=Coffee, Fairtrade & Rwanda |authorlink=Voluntary Service Overseas |url=http://www.vso.org.uk/thecoffeeproject/pdfs/coffee_english.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326051322/http://www.vso.org.uk/thecoffeeproject/pdfs/coffee_english.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2015-03-25 |p=9}}</ref> The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink to the bottom and pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them in the same way as the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating [[colander]]. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient.<ref name=\"VSO p9\"/> This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15\u201320 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.<ref name=\"VSO p9\"/>\n\n[[Image:MarabaCoffeeDryingRacks.jpg|thumb|right|Washed beans drying on racks]]\n\nThe technicians wash the beans several times to remove the remains of the skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry.<ref name=\"VSO p9\"/> Cooperative employees turn the beans regularly as technicians spot and remove bad beans.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ. We are exalted by joy, we are hovering between shining spheres, which have become the center of a world.\"<ref name=\"pet3\">{{cite web\n |title        = Stairs that continue to reveal themselves: the church of the Petraio and the villa where Paul Klee lived\n |publisher    = Vomero Magazine\n |author       = Identitainsorgenti.com\n |date         = October 4, 2017\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.identitainsorgenti.com%2Fnapoli-a-piedi-scale-che-continuano-a-svelarsi-la-chiesa-del-petraio-e-la-villa-dove-dimoro-paul-klee%2F}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the film [[The Four Days of Naples]], in the early stages of the Neapolitan uprising, a young man can be heard shouting: \"Pe 'e criatur' ro Petraio!\".\n*Popularly, the expression salir\u00e8 'ncoppo' is used in Santar\u00e8lla , which indicates the need to go from the Petraio to Villa La Santarella and Piazza Vanvitelli .\n*Author [[Nicola Pugliese]] in his book ''Malacqua'', cites Petraio, describing the origin of his name.\n\n==See Also==\n[[Stairways in Naples]]<br>\n[[Matera]]\n\n{{coord|40|50|35.8728|N|14|14|10.7016|E|display=title|region:IT_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petraio}}\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Naples]]\n[[Category:Zones of Naples]]\n\n==External References==\n* [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=it&rurl=translate.google.it&sl=it&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.scaledinapoli.com/&usg=ALkJrhjlxbq3eRVLr6oflxJlrzYoms77hA Stairways of Naples]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraio"}

The car is the successor to the [[SSC Aero]] and is the result of a design collaboration between [[Jason Castriota]] and SSC. Initially it was to be powered by a 6.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine but eventually the capacity of the engine was reduced to 5.9-liters in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/tuatara|date=July 6, 2019|title=Tuatara,SSC NorthAmerica|publisher=SSC NorthAmerica|access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> SSC has stated that the power output would be at {{convert|1350|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}}  or {{convert|1750|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} on E85 fuel, along with the top speed goal of {{convert|300|mph|kph|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/pebble-beach-2018/new-ssc-tuatara-aiming-300mph-top-speed|date=September 4, 2018|title=New SSC Tuatara is aiming for a 311mph top speed | publisher=Top Gear|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:SSC Tuatara by J.Smith831 - 003.jpg|thumb|SSC Tuatara concept]]\nSSC began working on the development of the successor of the [[SSC Aero|SSC Ultimate Aero]] in 2011. The new car, named the Tuatara was previewed in concept form at the 2011 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] but due to certain reasons never came to the production stage. In August 2018, 7 years after the debut of the concept, the production version of the Tuatara was shown to the general public. Designed by ex-[[Pininfarina]] designer [[Jason Castriota]], the car takes inspiration from the aerospace industry.\n\nThe Tuatara is named after the [[Tuatara|reptile]], found only in [[New Zealand]], known for having the fastest molecular evolution of any living animal.\n\nBoasting the lowest [[drag coefficient]] in its class at 0.279 and having a [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon-fiber]] body construction with aluminum crumple zones, SSC aims to set new benchmarks in the production car speed records by beating its competitors outright.\n\nThe interior contains leather and [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] upholstery and the functions of the car are controlled through a touch screen located on the center console.

The car is the successor to the [[SSC Aero]] and is the result of a design collaboration between [[Jason Castriota]] and SSC. Initially it was to be powered by a 6.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine but eventually the capacity of the engine was reduced to 5.9-liters in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/tuatara|date=July 6, 2019|title=Tuatara,SSC NorthAmerica|publisher=SSC NorthAmerica|access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> SSC has stated that the power output would be at {{convert|1350|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}}  or {{convert|1750|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} on E85 fuel, along with the top speed goal of {{convert|300|mph|kph|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/pebble-beach-2018/new-ssc-tuatara-aiming-300mph-top-speed|date=September 4, 2018|title=New SSC Tuatara is aiming for a 311mph top speed | publisher=Top Gear|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:SSC Tuatara by J.Smith831 - 003.jpg|thumb|SSC Tuatara concept]]\nSSC began working on the development of the successor of the [[SSC Aero|SSC Ultimate Aero]] in 2011. The new car, named the Tuatara was previewed in concept form at the 2011 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] but due to certain reasons never came to the production stage. In August 2018, 7 years after the debut of the concept, the production version of the Tuatara was shown to the general public. Designed by ex-[[Pininfarina]] designer [[Jason Castriota]], the car takes inspiration from the aero space industry.\n\nThe Tuatara is named after the [[Tuatara|reptile]], found only in [[New Zealand]], known for having the fastest molecular evolution of any living animal.\n\nBoasting the lowest [[Drag coefficient|coefficient of drag]] in its class at 0.279 and having a [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon-fiber]] body construction with aluminum crumple zones, SSC aims to set new benchmarks in the production car speed records by beating its competitors outright.\n\nThe interior contains leather and [[Alcantara_(material)|Alcantara]] upholstery and the functions of the car are controlled through a touch screen located on the center console. There is a configurable instrument panel behind the steering wheel displaying important information  about the car's status along with a 300 mph speedometer. The car uses a camera system instead of traditional side view mirrors.\n\nThe Tuatara will be produced at a purpose-built facility in West Richland, Washington and production will be limited to 100 cars.\n\nSSC has partnered with Nelson Racing Engines to build the engine, Linder Power Systems for engine sub-assembly fabrication and Automac for the production of the 7-speed semi-automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/news/tuatara-released|title=Press Release - The Tuatara Released|date=August 25, 2018|work=SSC North America|accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications and general data==\n===Engine===\n* '''Type''':  SSC-designed billet aluminium flat-plane crank V8 \n* '''Displacement''':  {{cvt|5.9|L|cuin cc|abbr=on}}\n* '''Compression Ratio''': 8.80:1\n* '''Horsepower''': {{convert|1350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,800 rpm (Engine is able to produce up to {{convert|1750|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 8,800 rpm on E85 flex fuel)\n* '''Torque''': {{convert|1280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 6,800 rpm<ref name=\"gizmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/ssc-teases-1700-hp/27276/|title=SSC completes engine testing on Tuatara supercar, teases 1,700 hp|publisher=}}</ref>\n* '''Redline''': 8,800 rpm\n* '''Fuel Injection''': Electronic sequential port with dual injection per cylinder\n* '''Oil''': SAE 5W/30 Fully Synthetic (Racing)\n* '''Induction System''': Sequential, multi-port fuel injection, twin-turbochargers, dual-water to air intercoolers\n* '''Fuel''': Premium Unleaded - 91RON pump octane, E85 flex fuel\n* '''Weight''': {{cvt|428|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''Transmission''':  7-Speed semi-automatic with robotised shifting mechanism\n* '''Clutch''': Triple-disc carbon ceramic, zicro'titanium clutch\n\n===General data===\n* '''Wheelbase''': {{convert|105.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''Length''': {{convert|182.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''Width''': {{convert|81.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''Height''': {{convert|42.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''Ground Clearance''': {{convert|4.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''Layout''': Mid-engined (Aero Direct-Straightline position of engine)\n* '''Drivetrain''': Longitudinal adjustable optional electrological rear-wheel drive (RWD)\n* '''Body/Frame''': Carbon-fiber/Carbon-fiber/Aluminium crash structures\n* '''Coefficient of Drag (Cd)''': 0.279\n* '''Frontal Area''': 18.0 sq. ft.\n* '''Brakes (Front)''': 16.0 inch Vented and slotted carbon ceramic discs with 6-piston calipers\n* '''Brakes (Rear)''': 15.0 inch Vented and slotted carbon ceramic discs with 4-piston calipers\n* '''Wheels''': Single-piece carbon fiber (19x9-1/2\" Front, 20x13\" Rear)\n* '''Tires''': [[Michelin]] Pilot Ultra Sport PS2-F1 (245/35 (YR)20 Front, 345/35 (YR)20 Rear)\n* '''Steering''': Rack & Pinion, Variable electric assist tilt column\n* '''Turns - Lock to Lock''': 2.5\n* '''Turning Circle''': {{convert|41.6|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n* '''Suspension''' (F/R): Adjustable hydraulic system with unequal length upper and lower A-arms, coil-over springs, remote reservoir-adjustable [[Penske]] coil-over shocks, cab controlled air lift, anti-roll bars\n* '''Total Dry Weight''': {{convert|2750|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/tuatara|publisher=SSC North America |date= August 24, 2018|accessdate=August 26, 2018|title=The future of HyperCars is here}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|SSC Tuatara}}\n\n* {{Official website|http://www.sscnorthamerica.com/tuatara.php}}\n* [https://www.foxnews.com/auto/say-hello-to-the-275-mph-tuatara Say Hello to the 275 MPH Tuatara]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722051214/http://www.thirdage.com/news/tuatara-supercar-will-hit-275-mph_07-20-2011 Tuatara will hit 275 MPH]\n* [http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/article45873270.html West Richland car plant ready to get rolling]\n\n* [https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1118285_ssc-reveals-tuatara-hypercars-twin-turbo-v-8 SSC reveals Tuatara hypercar's twin-turbo V-8]\n\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Da\u00df W\u00f6lf", "label": "safe", "comment": "reinstated correct parts of IP edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSC_Tuatara"}

It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.\n\nIn 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017.

He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nThe franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018.

Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.\n\nJohn and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something\u2014what he called the \"survival instinct\".\n\nFew of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.\n\nIn ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.\n\nThe first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.\n\nIn ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".\n\n[[File:Saw-cast.jpg|thumb|left|Central actors of the series. From top-left to bottom-right: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Cary Elwes, Costas Mandylor, Danny Glover, and Betsy Russell.|250px]]\n''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".\n\n''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.\n\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.\n\n''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.\n\n===Recurring elements===\n'''Billy'''\n{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}\nBilly is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.\n\nAge and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.\n\n'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''\n{{Main|Hello Zepp}}\n\n\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.\n\n'''Traps'''<br />\nAn important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.\n\nAccording to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair\u2014there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n[[File:Saw Guinness award cropped.jpg|thumb|The ''Saw'' series was placed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"Most Successful Horror Franchise\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/23/film-saw-idUSN2215375420100723|title=\"Saw\" movie franchise to get Guinness world record|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61rOhewtb|archive-date=September 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Pictured here is director [[Kevin Greutert]] receiving the award at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2010 Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/61775/|title=Splattered: An Interview with James Wan Talking torture, politics and not-so-sweet revenge|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 30, 2011|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/614BzHXY1|archive-date=August 19, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\n''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' grossed $18.2 million its opening weekend and had become [[Lionsgate]]'s second-best opening, after ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''{{'s}} {{nowrap|$23.9 million}} (2004).<ref name=\"BOMOpening\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1540&p=.htm|title='Ray,' 'Saw' See Robust Bows|last=Gray|first=Brandon|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Amazon.com|date=November 1, 2004|access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> ''Saw'' went on to gross {{nowrap|$103 million}} worldwide,<ref name=\"SawBOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw (2004)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> and is the second-lowest-grossing film in the series after ''[[Saw VI]]''.<ref name=\"Saw.vs\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=sawvs.htm|title='Saw' Vs.

It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.\n\nIn 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=\u2018SAW\u2019 Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nThe franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018. The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest-grossing horror film franchises of all time.

Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.\n\nJohn and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something\u2014what he called the \"survival instinct\".\n\nFew of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.\n\nIn ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.\n\nThe first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.\n\nIn ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".\n\n[[File:Saw-cast.jpg|thumb|left|Central actors of the series. From top-left to bottom-right: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Cary Elwes, Costas Mandylor, Danny Glover, and Betsy Russell.|250px]]\n''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".\n\n''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.\n\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.\n\n''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.\n\n===Recurring elements===\n'''Billy'''\n{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}\nBilly is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.\n\nAge and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.\n\n'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''\n{{Main|Hello Zepp}}\n\n\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.\n\n'''Traps'''<br />\nAn important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.\n\nAccording to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair\u2014there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n[[File:Saw Guinness award cropped.jpg|thumb|The ''Saw'' series was placed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"Most Successful Horror Franchise\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/23/film-saw-idUSN2215375420100723|title=\"Saw\" movie franchise to get Guinness world record|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61rOhewtb|archive-date=September 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Pictured here is director [[Kevin Greutert]] receiving the award at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2010 Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/61775/|title=Splattered: An Interview with James Wan Talking torture, politics and not-so-sweet revenge|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 30, 2011|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/614BzHXY1|archive-date=August 19, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\n''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' grossed $18.2 million its opening weekend and had become [[Lionsgate]]'s second-best opening, after ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''{{'s}} {{nowrap|$23.9 million}} (2004).<ref name=\"BOMOpening\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1540&p=.htm|title='Ray,' 'Saw' See Robust Bows|last=Gray|first=Brandon|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Amazon.com|date=November 1, 2004|access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> ''Saw'' went on to gross {{nowrap|$103 million}} worldwide,<ref name=\"SawBOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw (2004)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> and is the second-lowest-grossing film in the series after ''[[Saw VI]]''.<ref name=\"Saw.vs\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=sawvs.htm|title='Saw' Vs.
