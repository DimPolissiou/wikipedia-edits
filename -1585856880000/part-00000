In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

He and his friend Paarthasarathy aka Paartha leave for [[Pondicherry]] to attend the wedding via car. ''En route'', Saravanan recollects his past: He was a ruthless youth working in a film theatre with Paartha. He lives with his parents; his father, Varadharajan, who is educated and works as a college professor and his mother, Shenbagam, who is uneducated and is trying to pass an exam, just to get her college degree. One day in traffic, he sees Meera, a girl training to be an air hostess and [[Love at first sight|falls for her on site]]. He follows her to a cloth shop and also to her Air Hostess class. He saw her house and he and Partha go to her house, as Meera calls them. There, Meera threatens Saravanan by showing her father's photo, who is a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mahendra Kumar. But still, Saravanan follows her and asks her to love him. Meera takes him to Mahendra Kumar's office and he asks Saravanan to stop following Meera. Meera tells Saravanan that she has some qualifications required by her lover like shaving regularly, dressing well, breaking his friendship with Paartha, coming on time, etc.  Saravanan tells this to Partha and Partha asks him if he or Meera is best for him. Saravanan tells him Meera is more important to him than Paartha, causing a break between Saravanan's and Paartha's friendship.\n\nLater, Saravanan joins Paartha's broken love and asks him to rejoin his love. Partha agrees and then they go to [[Mumbai]], following Meera in a flight. There, Meera alas tells him that she loves Saravanan. After some months, Meera calls Saravanan once, but he does not pick up the phone and tells Paartha that Meera is not his real love and it is all nothing, but a drama. But, he really said that for fun. But, Paartha had accidentally switched on the phone while Saravanan told him all this. Meera, mistaking him for intentionally misusing her, comes there and breaks their love. Now, at Pondicherry, during Meera's marriage, both Saravanan and Partha end up drunk and tell a small story, in a comical way describing the broken love of Saravanan and Meera. Just as the marriage is going to happen, Rajini Murugan, a local don, comes there with a pregnant girl and his girlfriend and reveals that Meera's groom has a girlfriend, who is pregnant by him and that the girl Rajini Murugan is with, is that girl. The groom admits to his mistake and reunites with his old girlfriend. Saravanan and Paartha walk off the marriage hall, just then Meera comes and hugs Saravanan, hence reuniting with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]] as Saravanan\n* [[Hansika Motwani]] as Meera\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Paartha\n* [[Narayan Lucky]] as Sanjay, Meera's Fianc\u00e9\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Shenbagam\n* [[Azhagam Perumal]] as Varadharajan\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as DC Mahendrakumar\n* [[Uma Padmanabhan]] as Gayathri\n* [[Jangiri Madhumitha]] as Jangiri\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Ulundurpettai Ulaganantha\n* [[Mahanadi Shankar]] as Traffic Police\n* [[A.

''En route'', Saravanan recollects his past: He was a ruthless youth working in a film theatre with Paartha. He lives with his parents; his father, Varadharajan, who is educated and works as a college professor and his mother, Shenbagam, who is uneducated and is trying to pass an exam, just to get her college degree. One day in traffic, he sees Meera, a girl training to be an air hostess and [[Love at first sight|falls for her on site]]. He follows her to a cloth shop and also to her Air Hostess class. He saw her house and he and Partha go to her house, as Meera calls them. There, Meera threatens Saravanan by showing her father's photo, who is a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mahendra Kumar. But still, Saravanan follows her and asks her to love him. Meera takes him to Mahendra Kumar's office and he asks Saravanan to stop following Meera. Meera tells Saravanan that she has some qualifications required by her lover like shaving regularly, dressing well, breaking his friendship with Paartha, coming on time, etc.  Saravanan tells this to Partha and Partha asks him if he or Meera is best for him. Saravanan tells him Meera is more important to him than Paartha, causing a break between Saravanan's and Paartha's friendship.\n\nLater, Saravanan joins Paartha's broken love and asks him to rejoin his love. Partha agrees and then they go to [[Mumbai]], following Meera in a flight. There, Meera alas tells him that she loves Saravanan. After some months, Meera calls Saravanan once, but he does not pick up the phone and tells Paartha that Meera is not his real love and it is all nothing, but a drama. But, he really said that for fun. But, Paartha had accidentally switched on the phone while Saravanan told him all this. Meera, mistaking him for intentionally misusing her, comes there and breaks their love. Now, at Pondicherry, during Meera's marriage, both Saravanan and Partha end up drunk and tell a small story, in a comical way describing the broken love of Saravanan and Meera.

His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/admin/library/archives/06-002.htm|title=Young, Scott fonds|work=trentu.ca}}</ref> After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to [[Winnipeg]], but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]], for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nYoung began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the [[Winnipeg Free Press]] and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow \"Rassy\" Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/ragland/featured/3|title=Featured Articles about Ragland - Page 3 - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|work=orlandosentinel.com}}</ref>\n\n==Moves to Toronto==\nUnable to get a raise at the ''Free Press'', Young moved to [[Toronto]] in 1941, covering news and sports for the [[Canadian Press]] news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover [[World War II]] for CP. He came back a year later and joined the [[Royal Canadian Navy|Royal Canadian Naval Reserves]], where he served as a [[Communications Officer]] until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, [[Neil Young]], was born in Toronto in November 1945.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nYoung began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Collier's]]''. He quit his job at ''Maclean's'' in 1948 to write short stories full-time.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1949, Young bought a house in [[Omemee, Ontario]], near [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from ''[[Sports Illustrated]].'' His first novel ''The Flood'' was published in 1956. Young moved to [[Pickering, Ontario]] and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, [[Astrid Young]], in 1962.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nHe was also a host on [[Hockey Night in Canada]] until getting on the wrong side of [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] co-owner [[John Bassett]]. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Life on the farm==\nIn 1967, Young bought a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[farm]] near Omemee in [[Cavan-Monaghan, Ontario|Cavan Township]] and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the ''Globe'''s news bureau in [[Ottawa]]. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with [[Punch Imlach]]. The rights had been acquired by the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'', but the ''Globe'' wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the ''Globe'' and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the ''Telegram'', moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the ''Telegram'' until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the ''Globe and Mail''.

His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/admin/library/archives/06-002.htm|title=Young, Scott fonds|work=trentu.ca}}</ref> After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to [[Winnipeg]], but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]], for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nYoung began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the [[Winnipeg Free Press]] and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow \"Rassy\" Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/ragland/featured/3|title=Featured Articles about Ragland - Page 3 - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|work=orlandosentinel.com}}</ref>\n\n==Moves to Toronto==\nUnable to get a raise at the ''Free Press'', Young moved to [[Toronto]] in 1941, covering news and sports for the [[Canadian Press]] news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover [[World War II]] for CP. He came back a year later and joined the [[Royal Canadian Navy|Royal Canadian Naval Reserves]], where he served as a [[Communications Officer]] until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, [[Neil Young]], was born in Toronto in November 1945.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nYoung began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Collier's]]''. He quit his job at ''Maclean's'' in 1948 to write short stories full-time.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1949, Young bought a house in [[Omemee, Ontario]], near [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from ''[[Sports Illustrated]].'' His first novel ''The Flood'' was published in 1956. Young moved to [[Pickering, Ontario]] and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, [[Astrid Young]], in 1962.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nHe was also a host on [[Hockey Night in Canada]] until getting on the wrong side of [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] co-owner [[John Bassett]]. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Life on the farm==\nIn 1967, Young bought a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[farm]] near Omemee in [[Cavan-Monaghan, Ontario|Cavan Township]] and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the ''Globe'''s news bureau in [[Ottawa]]. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with [[Punch Imlach]]. The rights had been acquired by the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'', but the ''Globe'' wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the ''Globe'' and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the ''Telegram'', moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the ''Telegram'' until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the ''Globe and Mail''. Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow ''Globe'' writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the ''Globe'' over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit.

Chapter [[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 58]]</ref>\n}}\n'''Fitzwilliam Darcy''', generally referred to as '''Mr. Darcy''', is one of the two central [[Character (arts)|characters]] in [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. He is an archetype of the aloof [[romantic hero]], and a romantic interest of [[Elizabeth Bennet]], the novel's protagonist. The story's narration is almost exclusively from Elizabeth's perspective; the reader is given a one-sided view of Darcy for much of the novel, but hints are given throughout that there is much more to his character than meets the eye.  The reader gets a healthy dose of dramatic irony as Elizabeth continually censures (with some prejudice) Mr. Darcy's character despite the aforementioned hints (via the narrative voice and other characters' observations) that Mr. Darcy is really a noble character at heart, albeit somewhat prideful.  Usually referred to only as \"Mr. Darcy\" or \"Darcy\" by characters and the narrator, his first name is mentioned twice in the novel.<ref name=Fitzwilliam>''Pride and Prejudice''. Chapters \n[[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 25|25]] and [[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 35|35]].</ref>\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Darcy \u00e0 Netherfield.jpg|thumb|Mr. Darcy by [[C. E. Brock]], 1895]]\n\nMr. Darcy is a wealthy gentleman with an income exceeding \u00a310,000 a year<ref name=chapter59>''Pride and Prejudice''. Chapter [[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 59|59]].</ref> (equivalent to over \u00a313,000,000 a year in relative income<ref>https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/relativevalue.php</ref>) and the proprietor of [[Pemberley]], a large estate in [[Derbyshire]], England. Darcy first meets [[Elizabeth Bennet]] at a ball, where he makes rather demeaning remarks about her while she is within earshot. Gradually he becomes attracted to her and later attempts to court her while simultaneously struggling against his continued feelings of superiority. Darcy disapproves when his friend Bingley develops a serious attachment to Elizabeth's elder sister Jane, and subtly persuades Bingley that Jane does not return his feelings (which Darcy honestly believes). He later explains this seeming hypocrisy by asserting \"I was kinder to [Bingley] than to myself\". Although he doesn't realise it, Elizabeth's discovery of Darcy's interference in Bingley and Jane's budding relationship, and [[Mr. Wickham]]'s tale of how Darcy mistreated him, has caused her to dislike him intensely.\n\nEventually, Mr. Darcy declares his love for Elizabeth and asks for her hand. He reminds her of the large gap in their [[social status]]. Elizabeth is offended and vehemently refuses him, expressing her reasons for disliking him, including her knowledge of his interference with Jane and Bingley and the account she received from Mr. Wickham of Darcy's alleged unfair treatment toward him. Insulted by Darcy's arrogant retorts, Elizabeth says that his proposal prevented her from feeling concerns for him she \"might have felt had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner\". Darcy departs in anger and mortification and that night writes a letter to Elizabeth in which he defends his wounded honour, reveals the motives for his interference in Jane and Bingley's relationship, and gives a full account of his dealings with Wickham, who had attempted to seduce and elope with Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana, the previous summer.\n\nAlthough initially angered by Elizabeth's vehement refusal and harsh criticism, Darcy is shocked to discover the reality of how his behaviour is perceived by others, particularly Elizabeth, and commits himself to re-evaluate his actions. A few months later, Darcy unexpectedly encounters Elizabeth when she is visiting his estate in Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle. Elizabeth is first embarrassed to be discovered at Pemberley, having only visited on the belief that Darcy was absent; however, she is surprised to discover a marked change in Darcy's manner. Having responded to Elizabeth's criticism, Darcy is now determined to display the \"gentlemanlike manner\" she accused him of lacking and astonishes her with his kindness towards both her and her relations.\n\nOn discovering that Elizabeth's youngest sister [[Pride and Prejudice#Characters in Pride and Prejudice|Lydia]], has fallen prey to and run off with Mr. Wickham, Darcy tracks them down and induces Wickham to marry Lydia, thus saving both Lydia and her family from social disgrace. Darcy's intervention was done not to win Elizabeth\u2014he attempted to keep her from knowing of his involvement\u2014but rather to ease her distress (the narrator hints through Mr. Bennet that Darcy's intervention to help Elizabeth may have cost him as much as a year's income: ''\"Wickham's a fool if he takes [Lydia] with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds\"''). Darcy also felt partially responsible for failing to warn Elizabeth's family and the public of Wickham's true character.\n\nDarcy then releases Bingley to return to Longbourn and woo Jane, accepting his misjudgement of her character. Accompanying his friend to Longbourn, Darcy proposes to Elizabeth again, who accepts his proposal.\n\n==Depictions in film and television==\n{{further|Jane Austen in popular culture#Pride and Prejudice}}\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[1940 in film|1940]]\n|[[Laurence Olivier]]\n|Fitzwilliam Darcy\n|''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]''\n|align=\"left\"|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[2001 in film|2001]]\n|[[Colin Firth]]\n|Mark Darcy\n|''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''\n|align=\"left\"|An adaptation of the novel ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' by [[Helen Fielding]].

He thinks he is better than the lower classes in both rank and connections and so he does not wish to interact with them; we see evidence of this in Meryton\u2014at all of the parties, he seems to distance himself from the rest of the crowd because he does not think them as worthy acquaintances. Another unspoken fact is that he is also meant to be a member of the old [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] aristocracy, as indicated by his own name as well as that of his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. At the dance, he does not wish to dance with any girl because they were all beneath him in class and beauty. He does, however, mention later on to Elizabeth that he does not find it easy to make new acquaintances and finds it hard to converse with people he does not know. This shows a sort of shy, perhaps even reclusive nature in Darcy that is not illustrated before this point in the book. For his friends though, he is honourable, friendly, and caring. For example, his behaviour with Bingley is more than brotherly as he rescues him from a bad marriage and is a constant companion at his side. Through Elizabeth, he learns to be less boastful and arrogant because he realises that his actions have deeply affected others. This arrogance is seen in his first proposal to Elizabeth whereby he acts with more pride rather than in a loving manner. Despite the way in which Elizabeth often mocks him, she is surprised by his \"gallantry\" as he persists in pursuing her.<ref>Brower, Reuben Arthur \"Irony Reveals Character and Advances the Drama\" page 144-152 from ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' edited by Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999 page 149.</ref>\n\nVivien Jones notes that Darcy's handsome appearance, wealth and original arrogance signify to the reader that he is the hero of a [[romance novel]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Vivien|last2=Austen|first2=Jane|last3=Tanner|first3=Tony|title=Pride and prejudice|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-143951-8|pages=xi\u2013xii|edition=2003 Penguin|url=https://archive.org/details/prideprejudice400aust}}</ref> Wickham's irresponsible elopement with Lydia allows Darcy to demonstrate that he now feels responsible for Wickham's continued bad behaviour by his silence - if he had made Wickham's bad character known, Lydia would have been safe.

In some ways, natural human dignity had been sacrificed on the altar of a kind of rococo politeness. ... Acceptable behaviour had become toy-like and it was not long before the anti-heroic fashion for a delicate sensibility ran out of control.

Darcy is fine, tall, handsome, noble, proud, forbidding, disagreeable and subject to no control but his own...Darcy is a 19th-century man, manliness itself, uncompromising, dark and sexy. And it is Darcy, of course, whom the novel ends up loving\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" />\n\nThe character of Mr. Darcy very much reflects the changing standards of English masculinity as unlike the heroes of the 18th century with their excessive politeness and unwillingness to offend, Mr. Darcy says whatever he likes, which showed his authenticity and honesty, which were the most important attributes for a man in the new Romantic age.<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Even after Mr. Darcy apologises to Miss Bennet for his brusque rudeness, his honesty meant that change of heart was sincere, and not the polished words of a follower of the cult of sensibility. More broadly, the character of Mr. Darcy showed the emergence of a new type of rawer masculinity that could not tolerate the foppish, superficial values of the previous century.<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Nicolson called Darcy \"the template on which the severe and unbending model of Victorian manliness is founded\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Nicolson concluded that: \"The implication of the novel is that there is something better than politeness and that the merely civil is inadequate...Darcy is 'silent, grave and indifferent', words in this new moral universe which signal pure approval\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> At one point, Darcy states \"disguise of every sort is my abhorrence\" reflecting the fact he never pretends to be anything other than what he is.<ref>Paris, Bernard \"Marriage and Manners in Civilized Society\" pages 33-42 from ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' edited by Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999 page 40.</ref> When the lightweight and pretentious Miss Bingley lists all the attributes of \"an accomplished woman\", Darcy says \"To all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading\", indicating he wants more from a woman than what Miss Bingley thinks is necessary.<ref>Ross, Josephine ''Jane Austen A Companion'', London: John Murray, 2002 page 106.</ref>\n\nNicolson further argued that a character like Mr. Darcy reflects changes in British life as the Romantic age was a time when \"What mattered was authentic, self-generated worth\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> In this regard, the novel says \"Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with\".<ref>Brownstein, Rachel \"''Northanger Abbey, ''Sense and Sensibility, ''Pride and Prejudice''\" pages 32-57 from ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997 page 54.</ref> Darcy is attracted to Elizabeth early on, but he sees her as unfit socially as a wife;

For the British middle class or \"middling sort\" as Austen called them, to emulate the landed elite, however, retained its social superiority.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\">Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 61.</ref> The character of Mr. Darcy reflects this trend.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\"/> When Mr. Bingley suggests that he might like to one day build an estate like Pemberley, he is informed by Mr. Darcy that it is not the estate itself, but rather what it contains, its cultural heritage like the family library that makes Pemberley special as Mr. Bingley cannot be the heir to a family library built up over generations like the one Mr. Darcy is the heir to.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\"/> In this way, Austen suggests that there is more to Mr. Darcy than the proud and sneering man at the Meryton assembly, that there is a deepness to him as people like him are custodians of the national culture.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\"/> The scholar C. C. Barfoot described Pemberley as the \"marvelous accretion of all the choices made by his predecessors\", providing as the novel calls it \"a kind of model\" for how to live properly.<ref name=\"Barefoot,C pages 52-59\">Barfoot, C. C. \"Fate and Choice in ''Pride and Prejudice'' pages 52-59 from  ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' edited by Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999 page 54.</ref> Barfoot argued that for Austen \"civilization is not a gift, but is a possession that needs to be earned and sustained by practice\"; in this regard, the fact that Darcy takes good care of his estate shows his basically civilised nature which he hides under his veneer of snobbery and coldness.<ref name=\"Barefoot,C pages 52-59\"/>\n\nA sign of the depth of Darcy's love for Elizabeth can be seen in that he tracks down Lydia and Wickham despite all of the costs.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\">Brown, James \"Jane Austen's Mental Maps\" pages 20-41 from ''Critical Survey'', Volume 26, No. 1 page 25.</ref> The scholar James Brown observed at the time transport via the mud roads of Britain was hugely expensive, citing the remark by the novelist Sir Walter Scott that it had cost him 50 pounds to travel from Edinburgh to London in 1828; in today's money the sum was equal to 2,500 pounds.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\"/> Brown wrote the readers in Austen's time would had known it had been an expensive burden for Darcy to go off searching for Wickham and Lydia, and readers today almost missed the significance of Darcy's financial sacrifice caused by his love for Elizabeth.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\"/> However, Brown wrote that Scott himself had admitted that he insisted on travelling in style on his trip, staying at the most expensive hotels and eating at the most expensive restaurants as befitting a gentleman of means, and that not all travellers at the time would have stayed and eaten at the same sort of establishments patronised by Scott.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\"/>\n\nIrvine argued that for someone like Darcy who lives about half of the year in London, which is a glittering and far-away place for people of Meryton, this proves his social superiority as his \"London manners\" are described variously in the novel as \"fashionable\" and \"elegant\".<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 60\">Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 60.</ref> Irvine argued that the union of Elizabeth and Darcy at the end of the novel was meant by Austen as a symbol of the union of the national and regional elites in England, forging together a united nation.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 60\"/> One scholar Rachel Brownstein noted of all the Austen romances that of Darcy and Elizabeth is the only one where the couple began as complete strangers at the beginning of the book, making ''Pride and Prejudice'' the most romantic of the Austen novels.<ref>Brownstein, Rachel \"''Northanger Abbey, ''Sense and Sensibility, ''Pride and Prejudice''\" pages 32-57 from ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997 page 51.</ref>\n\nIrvine argued that Elizabeth appears to be unworthy of Darcy not because of their differences in income level, but because of the class divide as she contemplates the glories of Pemberley.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 59.</ref> Against the interpretation that ''Pride and Prejudice'' is primarily a novel about class, the American scholar Susan Morgan argued the novel is about character, stating Mr. Wickham may not be as wealthy as Darcy, but his commission in the militia would have made an eminently respectable man to marry in Regency England.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\">{{cite journal |last1=Morgan |first1=Susan |title=Intelligence in 'Pride and Prejudice' |journal=Modern Philology |volume=73|issue=1 |year=1975 |pages=54\u201368 |issn=0026-8232 |doi=10.1086/390617}}</ref> Morgan wrote though Darcy is rich, he does not represent \"society\" as some would have done, because he is reserved, vain, and quasi-isolated from society.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan argued that Austen's message in ''Pride and Prejudice'' is that one should marry for love rather than money as Wickham disqualifies himself as a potential groom owing to his bad character, not his income.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan observed that for most of the novel Darcy loves Elizabeth even when she loathes him and also when she comes to return his feelings. Austen writes it was because of \"a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude - Gratitude, not merely for having loved her once, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection\".<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan argued that the growth of Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy is a sign of her intellectual growth, as she comes to understand that freedom means the freedom to appreciate and understand the value of love.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> In this sense, Darcy by seeking to improve himself, by ignoring repeated slights and insults, and by paying off Wickham's debts to rescue Lydia from her ill-conceived marriage just to impress her, proves himself worthy of Elizabeth's love.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan wrote that the gratitude that Austen meant for Elizabeth to feel for Darcy \"...is a gratitude that, despite all the obstacles which realism can provide, despite time, conventions, and misunderstanding, despite her wrongs and his own limitations, Mr. Darcy can see Elizabeth honestly and can love her as well.\"<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> One critic, Wilbur Cross, wrote at first Darcy displays outrageous arrogance to Elizabeth, but the novel ends with an \"almost pitiable humiliation of Darcy\", which was a testament to the power of women to tame men.<ref>Bloom, Harold ''Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice'', New York: Chelsea House Publishing, 1996 page 28-29.</ref>\n\nDarcy has proven that he loves Elizabeth but she did not notice that there was a good Darcy deep down in his heart.\n\n==Cultural influence and legacy==\nThe character of Fitzwilliam Darcy has appeared in and inspired numerous works. Both Mr. Darcy and [[Elizabeth Bennet]] feature as part of [[science fiction]] [[author]] [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s fictional '[[Wold Newton family]]', which links numerous literary characters (such as [[Tarzan]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]]) via an interconnected family tree of people and events.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} According to Farmer's works, both were exposed to radiation from a meteorite that struck [[Wold Newton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Wold Newton]] in [[Yorkshire]] in the 1790s (a documented event). This allowed them to be the ancestors of many other famous literary characters, some of whom possessed unusual or even superhuman gifts and abilities. Numerous re-imaginings of the original work written from the perspective of Mr. Darcy have also been published, among them American writer [[Pamela Aidan]]'s ''[[Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman]]'' trilogy, and English author Janet Aylmer's successful novel ''[[Darcy's Story]]'' published in the UK ({{ISBN|9780952821021}}) and later in the United States ({{ISBN|9780061148705}}).\n\n[[Helen Fielding]] has admitted she \"pillaged her plot\"<ref>[http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/bridget_joness_diary.html Penguin Reading Guides - Bridget Jones's Diary] Retrieved on January 4-2008.</ref> for ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' from ''Pride and Prejudice''.

He is an archetype of the aloof [[romantic hero]], and a romantic interest of [[Elizabeth Bennet]], the novel's protagonist. The story's narration is almost exclusively from Elizabeth's perspective; the reader is given a one-sided view of Darcy for much of the novel, but hints are given throughout that there is much more to his character than meets the eye.  The reader gets a healthy dose of dramatic irony as Elizabeth continually censures (with some prejudice) Mr. Darcy's character despite the aforementioned hints (via the narrative voice and other characters' observations) that Mr. Darcy is really a noble character at heart, albeit somewhat prideful.  Usually referred to only as \"Mr. Darcy\" or \"Darcy\" by characters and the narrator, his first name is mentioned twice in the novel.<ref name=Fitzwilliam>''Pride and Prejudice''. Chapters \n[[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 25|25]] and [[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 35|35]].</ref>\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Darcy \u00e0 Netherfield.jpg|thumb|Mr. Darcy by [[C. E. Brock]], 1895]]\n\nMr. Darcy is a wealthy gentleman with an income exceeding \u00a310,000 a year<ref name=chapter59>''Pride and Prejudice''. Chapter [[wikisource:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 59|59]].</ref> (equivalent to over \u00a313,000,000 a year in relative income<ref>https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/relativevalue.php</ref>) and the proprietor of [[Pemberley]], a large estate in [[Derbyshire]], England. Darcy first meets [[Elizabeth Bennet]] at a ball, where he makes rather demeaning remarks about her while she is within earshot. Gradually he becomes attracted to her and later attempts to court her while simultaneously struggling against his continued feelings of superiority. Darcy disapproves when his friend Bingley develops a serious attachment to Elizabeth's elder sister Jane, and subtly persuades Bingley that Jane does not return his feelings (which Darcy honestly believes). He later explains this seeming hypocrisy by asserting \"I was kinder to [Bingley] than to myself\". Although he doesn't realise it, Elizabeth's discovery of Darcy's interference in Bingley and Jane's budding relationship, and [[Mr. Wickham]]'s tale of how Darcy mistreated him, has caused her to dislike him intensely.\n\nEventually, Mr. Darcy declares his love for Elizabeth and asks for her hand. He reminds her of the large gap in their [[social status]]. Elizabeth is offended and vehemently refuses him, expressing her reasons for disliking him, including her knowledge of his interference with Jane and Bingley and the account she received from Mr. Wickham of Darcy's alleged unfair treatment toward him. Insulted by Darcy's arrogant retorts, Elizabeth says that his proposal prevented her from feeling concerns for him she \"might have felt had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner\". Darcy departs in anger and mortification and that night writes a letter to Elizabeth in which he defends his wounded honour, reveals the motives for his interference in Jane and Bingley's relationship, and gives a full account of his dealings with Wickham, who had attempted to seduce and elope with Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana, the previous summer.\n\nAlthough initially angered by Elizabeth's vehement refusal and harsh criticism, Darcy is shocked to discover the reality of how his behaviour is perceived by others, particularly Elizabeth, and commits himself to re-evaluate his actions. A few months later, Darcy unexpectedly encounters Elizabeth when she is visiting his estate in Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle. Elizabeth is first embarrassed to be discovered at Pemberley, having only visited on the belief that Darcy was absent; however, she is surprised to discover a marked change in Darcy's manner. Having responded to Elizabeth's criticism, Darcy is now determined to display the \"gentlemanlike manner\" she accused him of lacking and astonishes her with his kindness towards both her and her relations.\n\nOn discovering that Elizabeth's youngest sister [[Pride and Prejudice#Characters in Pride and Prejudice|Lydia]], has fallen prey to and run off with Mr. Wickham, Darcy tracks them down and induces Wickham to marry Lydia, thus saving both Lydia and her family from social disgrace. Darcy's intervention was done not to win Elizabeth\u2014he attempted to keep her from knowing of his involvement\u2014but rather to ease her distress (the narrator hints through Mr. Bennet that Darcy's intervention to help Elizabeth may have cost him as much as a year's income: ''\"Wickham's a fool if he takes [Lydia] with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds\"''). Darcy also felt partially responsible for failing to warn Elizabeth's family and the public of Wickham's true character.\n\nDarcy then releases Bingley to return to Longbourn and woo Jane, accepting his misjudgement of her character. Accompanying his friend to Longbourn, Darcy proposes to Elizabeth again, who accepts his proposal.\n\n==Depictions in film and television==\n{{further|Jane Austen in popular culture#Pride and Prejudice}}\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[1940 in film|1940]]\n|[[Laurence Olivier]]\n|Fitzwilliam Darcy\n|''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]''\n|align=\"left\"|\n|-align=\"center\"\n|[[2001 in film|2001]]\n|[[Colin Firth]]\n|Mark Darcy\n|''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''\n|align=\"left\"|An adaptation of the novel ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' by [[Helen Fielding]].

He  thinks he is better than the lower classes in both rank and connections and so he does not wish to interact with them; we see evidence of this in Meryton  - at all of the parties, he seems to distance himself from the rest of the crowd because he does not think them as worthy acquaintances. Another unspoken fact is that he is also meant to be a member of the old [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] aristocracy, as indicated by his own name as well as that of his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. At the dance, he does not wish to dance with any girl because they were all beneath him in class and beauty. He does, however, mention later on to Elizabeth that he does not find it easy to make new acquaintances and finds it hard to converse with people he does not know. This shows a sort of shy, perhaps even reclusive nature in Darcy that is not illustrated before this point in the book. For his friends though, he is honourable, friendly, and caring. For example, his behaviour with Bingley is more than brotherly as he rescues him from a bad marriage and is a constant companion at his side. Through Elizabeth, he learns to be less boastful and arrogant because he realises that his actions have deeply affected others. This arrogance is seen in his first proposal to Elizabeth whereby he acts with more pride rather than in a loving manner. Despite the way in which Elizabeth often mocks him, she is surprised by his \"gallantry\" as he persists in pursuing her.<ref>Brower, Reuben Arthur \"Irony Reveals Character and Advances the Drama\" page 144-152 from ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' edited by Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999 page 149.</ref>\n\nVivien Jones notes that Darcy's handsome appearance, wealth and original arrogance signify to the reader that he is the hero of a [[romance novel]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Vivien|last2=Austen|first2=Jane|last3=Tanner|first3=Tony|title=Pride and prejudice|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-143951-8|pages=xi\u2013xii|edition=2003 Penguin|url=https://archive.org/details/prideprejudice400aust}}</ref>\nWickham's irresponsible elopement with Lydia allows Darcy to demonstrate that he now feels responsible for Wickham's continued bad behaviour by his silence - if he had made Wickham's bad character known, Lydia would have been safe.

Acceptable behaviour had become toy-like and it was not long before the anti-heroic fashion for a delicate sensibility ran out of control.

Boldness |url=https://archive.org/details/seizefire00adam/page/157 }}</ref> In the 18th-century idea, a man was expected above all to be pleasant and pleasing, and so it was better for a man to lie rather say anything which might offend.<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> By the early 19th century, a tougher, more brooding version of masculinity was starting to come into the vogue and the character of Mr. Darcy exemplifies the trend.<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Nicolson described the differences between Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy as follows: \"Mr. Bingley is a[n] 18th century man: handsome, young, agreeable, delightful, fond of dancing, gentlemanlike, pleasant, easy, unaffected and not entirely in control of his own destiny. Darcy is fine, tall, handsome, noble, proud, forbidding, disagreeable and subject to no control but his own...Darcy is a 19th-century man, manliness itself, uncompromising, dark and sexy. And it is Darcy, of course, whom the novel ends up loving\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" />\n\nThe character of Mr. Darcy very much reflects the changing standards of English masculinity as unlike the heroes of the 18th century with their excessive politeness and unwillingness to offend, Mr. Darcy says whatever he likes, which showed his authenticity and honesty, which were the most important attributes for a man in the new Romantic age.<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Even after Mr. Darcy apologises to Miss Bennet for his brusque rudeness, his honesty meant that change of heart was sincere, and not the polished words of a follower of the cult of sensibility. More broadly, the character of Mr. Darcy showed the emergence of a new type of rawer masculinity that could not tolerate the foppish, superficial values of the previous century.<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Nicolson called Darcy \"the template on which the severe and unbending model of Victorian manliness is founded\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> Nicolson concluded that: \"The implication of the novel is that there is something better than politeness and that the merely civil is inadequate...Darcy is 'silent, grave and indifferent', words in this new moral universe which signal pure approval\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> At one point, Darcy states \"disguise of every sort is my abhorrence\" reflecting the fact he never pretends to be anything other than what he is.<ref>Paris, Bernard \"Marriage and Manners in Civilized Society\" pages 33-42 from ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' edited by Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999 page 40.</ref> When the lightweight and pretentious Miss Bingley lists all the attributes of \"an accomplished woman\", Darcy says \"To all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading\", indicating he wants more from a woman than what Miss Bingley thinks is necessary.<ref>Ross, Josephine ''Jane Austen A Companion'', London: John Murray, 2002 page 106.</ref>\n\nNicolson further argued that a character like Mr. Darcy reflects changes in British life as the Romantic age was a time when \"What mattered was authentic, self-generated worth\".<ref name=\"Nicolson2005\" /> In this regard, the novel says \"Of this she was perfectly unaware;

For the British middle class or \"middling sort\" as Austen called them, to emulate the landed elite, however, retained its social superiority.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\">Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 61.</ref> The character of Mr. Darcy reflects this trend.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\"/> When Mr. Bingley suggests that he might like to one day build an estate like Pemberley, he is informed by Mr. Darcy that it is not the estate itself, but rather what it contains, its cultural heritage like the family library that makes Pemberley special as Mr. Bingley cannot be the heir to a family library built up over generations like the one Mr. Darcy is the heir to.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\"/> In this way, Austen suggests that there is more to Mr. Darcy than the proud and sneering man at the Meryton assembly, that there is a deepness to him as people like him are custodians of the national culture.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 61\"/> The scholar C. C. Barfoot described Pemberley as the \"marvelous accretion of all the choices made by his predecessors\", providing as the novel calls it \"a kind of model\" for how to live properly.<ref name=\"Barefoot,C pages 52-59\">Barfoot, C. C. \"Fate and Choice in ''Pride and Prejudice'' pages 52-59 from  ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' edited by Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999 page 54.</ref> Barfoot argued that for Austen \"civilization is not a gift, but is a possession that needs to be earned and sustained by practice\"; in this regard, the fact that Darcy takes good care of his estate shows his basically civilised nature which he hides under his veneer of snobbery and coldness.<ref name=\"Barefoot,C pages 52-59\"/>\n\nA sign of the depth of Darcy's love for Elizabeth can be seen in that he tracks down Lydia and Wickham despite all of the costs.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\">Brown, James \"Jane Austen's Mental Maps\" pages 20-41 from ''Critical Survey'', Volume 26, No. 1 page 25.</ref> The scholar James Brown observed at the time transport via the mud roads of Britain was hugely expensive, citing the remark by the novelist Sir Walter Scott that it had cost him 50 pounds to travel from Edinburgh to London in 1828; in today's money the sum was equal to 2,500 pounds.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\"/> Brown wrote the readers in Austen's time would had known it had been an expensive burden for Darcy to go off searching for Wickham and Lydia, and readers today almost missed the significance of Darcy's financial sacrifice caused by his love for Elizabeth.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\"/> However, Brown wrote that Scott himself had admitted that he insisted on travelling in style on his trip, staying at the most expensive hotels and eating at the most expensive restaurants as befitting a gentleman of means, and that not all travellers at the time would have stayed and eaten at the same sort of establishments patronised by Scott.<ref name=\"Brown pages 20-41\"/>\n\nIrvine argued that for someone like Darcy who lives about half of the year in London, which is a glittering and far-away place for people of Meryton, this proves his social superiority as his \"London manners\" are described variously in the novel as \"fashionable\" and \"elegant\".<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 60\">Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 60.</ref> Irvine argued that the union of Elizabeth and Darcy at the end of the novel was meant by Austen as a symbol of the union of the national and regional elites in England, forging together a united nation.<ref name=\"Irvine, Robert page 60\"/> One scholar Rachel Brownstein noted of all the Austen romances that of Darcy and Elizabeth is the only one where the couple began as complete strangers at the beginning of the book, making ''Pride and Prejudice'' the most romantic of the Austen novels.<ref>Brownstein, Rachel \"''Northanger Abbey, ''Sense and Sensibility, ''Pride and Prejudice''\" pages 32-57 from ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997 page 51.</ref>\n\nIrvine argued that Elizabeth appears to be unworthy of Darcy not because of their differences in income level, but because of the class divide as she contemplates the glories of Pemberley.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 59.</ref> Against the interpretation that ''Pride and Prejudice'' is primarily a novel about class, the American scholar Susan Morgan argued the novel is about character, stating Mr. Wickham may not be as wealthy as Darcy, but his commission in the militia would have made an eminently respectable man to marry in Regency England.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\">{{cite journal |last1=Morgan |first1=Susan |title=Intelligence in 'Pride and Prejudice' |journal=Modern Philology |volume=73|issue=1 |year=1975 |pages=54\u201368 |issn=0026-8232 |doi=10.1086/390617}}</ref> Morgan wrote though Darcy is rich, he does not represent \"society\" as some would have done, because he is reserved, vain, and quasi-isolated from society.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan argued that Austen's message in ''Pride and Prejudice'' is that one should marry for love rather than money as Wickham disqualifies himself as a potential groom owing to his bad character, not his income.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan observed that for most of the novel Darcy loves Elizabeth even when she loathes him and also when she comes to return his feelings. Austen writes it was because of \"a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude - Gratitude, not merely for having loved her once, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection\".<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan argued that the growth of Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy is a sign of her intellectual growth, as she comes to understand that freedom means the freedom to appreciate and understand the value of love.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> In this sense, Darcy by seeking to improve himself, by ignoring repeated slights and insults, and by paying off Wickham's debts to rescue Lydia from her ill-conceived marriage just to impress her, proves himself worthy of Elizabeth's love.<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> Morgan wrote that the gratitude that Austen meant for Elizabeth to feel for Darcy \"...is a gratitude that, despite all the obstacles which realism can provide, despite time, conventions, and misunderstanding, despite her wrongs and his own limitations, Mr. Darcy can see Elizabeth honestly and can love her as well.\"<ref name=\"Morgan1975\" /> One critic, Wilbur Cross, wrote at first Darcy displays outrageous arrogance to Elizabeth, but the novel ends with an \"almost pitiable humiliation of Darcy\", which was a testament to the power of women to tame men.<ref>Bloom, Harold ''Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice'', New York: Chelsea House Publishing, 1996 page 28-29.</ref>\n\nDarcy has proven that he loves Elizabeth but she did not notice that there was a good Darcy deep down in his heart.\n\n==Cultural influence and legacy==\nThe character of Fitzwilliam Darcy has appeared in and inspired numerous works. Both Mr. Darcy and [[Elizabeth Bennet]] feature as part of [[science fiction]] [[author]] [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s fictional '[[Wold Newton family]]', which links numerous literary characters (such as [[Tarzan]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]]) via an interconnected family tree of people and events.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} According to Farmer's works, both were exposed to radiation from a meteorite that struck [[Wold Newton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Wold Newton]] in [[Yorkshire]] in the 1790s (a documented event). This allowed them to be the ancestors of many other famous literary characters, some of whom possessed unusual or even superhuman gifts and abilities. Numerous re-imaginings of the original work written from the perspective of Mr. Darcy have also been published, among them American writer [[Pamela Aidan]]'s ''[[Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman]]'' trilogy, and English author Janet Aylmer's successful novel ''[[Darcy's Story]]'' published in the UK ({{ISBN|9780952821021}}) and later in the United States ({{ISBN|9780061148705}}).\n\n[[Helen Fielding]] has admitted she \"pillaged her plot\"<ref>[http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/bridget_joness_diary.html Penguin Reading Guides - Bridget Jones's Diary] Retrieved on January 4-2008.</ref> for ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' from ''Pride and Prejudice''.

She was the youngest of five daughters of Dr. Lorenzo Mullican, DDS, and his wife, Cora Bell Hicks. Dr. Mullican had a dental practice in Indianola. The family owned a large house with 22 rooms, some of which they rented out to students attending nearby [[Simpson College]].\n\nPriscilla and one of her sisters, Rosemary, traveled to Des Moines every weekend to study dancing with Rose Lorenz, renown dance teacher<ref name=\"Betty Hill Dance\">{{ cite web|access-date=April 1, 2020 |url=https://www.bettyhilldance.com/erabetty.htm |title=The Era of Miss Betty: 1955 to 1975}}</ref> at the time.  The girls made their first professional appearance September 30, 1930, at Des Moines' Paramount Theater. Priscilla, then 15, performed on stage as part of the entertainment accompanying the release of her sister Lola's Hollywood movie ''[[Good News (1930 film)|Good News]]'' (1930).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Priscilla was permitted to travel to New York to visit a third sister, Leota, who was then appearing in a musical revue in Manhattan. Priscilla enrolled at the nearby Fagen School of Dramatics, and Leota paid the fee. At this time, talent agent Al Altman saw Priscilla performing in one of Fagen's school plays and invited her to [[screentest]] for [[MGM]]. She was 16 years old. Priscilla wrote to a friend in Indianola, \"Leota accompanied me to a sort of theater in a New York skyscraper. Others were there being made up. One was a strange looking girl with her hair slicked back in a sort of a bun. Her name is said to be [[Katharine Hepburn|Catherine Hepburn]] [sic]. Not very pretty, I thought, but Mr. Altman said she has something. [[Margaret Sullavan]], the Broadway actress, was there too!\" A follow-up letter said that her test had proven unsuitable. Neither Hepburn nor Sullavan were approved, and neither received a contract from MGM at the time.\n\nIn 1932, Cora and Rosemary arrived in New York. Cora immediately went to work pushing her two young daughters into attending auditions for various prospective Broadway productions, without success. During a tryout at a music publishing office, orchestra leader and radio personality [[Fred Waring]] heard them harmonizing. He found them attractive and talented and soon signed them to a radio contract. Priscilla, who at this time adopted the surname Lane, quickly became known as the comedienne of the group. Rosemary sang the ballads, while Priscilla performed the swing numbers and wisecracked with Waring and various guests.  Back in Iowa, Dr. Mullican instituted divorce proceedings against his wife on the grounds of desertion, and the divorce was granted in 1933.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Priscilla Lane Cowboy from Brooklyn trailer.jpg|thumb|Priscilla Lane in ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', 1938]]\nRosemary and Priscilla remained with Fred Waring for almost five years. In 1937, Waring was engaged by [[Warner Bros.]] in Hollywood to appear with his entire band in ''[[Varsity Show (film)|Varsity Show]]'', a musical starring [[Dick Powell]]. Both Rosemary and Priscilla were tested and awarded feature roles in the film. Rosemary shared the romantic passages with Powell, while Priscilla played a high-spirited college girl.\n\nWarner Bros. purchased Priscilla and Rosemary's contract from Fred Waring and signed them to seven-year pacts.<ref name=\"independent\"/> Priscilla's first film after ''Varsity Show'' was ''[[Men Are Such Fools]]'' (1938), in which she starred with [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]]. This was followed by ''Love Honor and Behave'' (also 1938), another light romantic comedy with Morris, who, playing her husband, [[spanked]] her 47 times in a scene for which she declined a double, and ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', again teaming with Dick Powell. The publicity department at the studio suggested that Priscilla and Morris be seen together around town. They liked each other and did date for a period; however, Priscilla later said it was never serious on either side.\n\nPriscilla was next assigned the lead in ''[[Brother Rat]]'', which had been a very successful Broadway play. Again she played opposite Wayne Morris, and among the cast were newcomers [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Jane Bryan]], and [[Eddie Albert]]. The film, when released in October 1938, was a big success for all the young players. At this time of professional success, the sisters were informed that Dr. Mullican had died in Iowa.\n\nAfter winning her raise, Priscilla returned to work, but the films assigned to her were no better than those she had turned down. ''[[Brother Rat and a Baby]]'' (aka, ''Baby Be Good'', 1940) was an inferior sequel and ''[[Three Cheers for the Irish]]'' (also 1940) gave her little to do.\n\nThe British ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, always a supporter of the Lane Sisters, stated that all was not right with Priscilla Lane. In its June 15, 1940 issue, they wondered why \"Priscilla was still knocking at the door of major stardom\". They felt Warner Bros. was casting her as stooge to such actors as [[John Garfield]] and [[James Cagney]]. They went on to say Priscilla had great charm and while not a really great dramatic actress, deserved much larger and more important roles than she was getting. The same magazine, two years later on August 22, 1942, referred to their 1940 article and once again expressed disappointment at Warners' treatment of the star. They were unaware that she had already left the studio.\n\nOn April 28, 1941, she was heard on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' with [[George Brent]] and [[Gail Patrick]] in ''Wife, Husband and Friend''. At Warner Bros. she appeared opposite [[Ronald Reagan]] in a lighthearted comedy, ''[[Million Dollar Baby (1941 film)|Million Dollar Baby]]'' (1941) and as a night club singer in ''[[Blues in the Night]]'' (also 1941).\n\n[[Frank Capra]] requested her for the lead opposite [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. The comedy film was completed in early 1942, but was not released until 1944; it was held up by contractual agreement not to distribute the film until the play's long Broadway run was over. It was Priscilla's last Warner film. Her contract was terminated by mutual agreement after five years with the studio.\n\nShe freelanced next, signing a one-picture deal with [[Universal Studios]] where she starred with [[Robert Cummings]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). The director did not want either Cummings or Lane for their roles. Hitchcock felt Lane was too much the girl next door. Universal insisted that they play the leads, and when the film was released, her acting was praised while some criticism was focused on Hitchcock for reworking so much from his earlier films into this wartime spy drama.\n\nShe had commitments for two more films. The first was ''Silver Queen'' (1942) for producer [[Harry Sherman]] in which she co-starred with [[George Brent]]. She played the owner of a gambling house in 1870s San Francisco. The other film was a [[Jack Benny]] comedy, ''The Meanest Man in the World'', released in January 1943. Lane then retired from films. For the duration of the war, she followed her husband across America as he moved from one military base to another. She was generous with her talents and often performed at camp shows.\n\nWhile living in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], she was offered and accepted the leading role in ''Fun on a Weekend'' (1947) for producer\u2013director [[Andrew L. Stone|Andrew Stone]], co-starring [[Eddie Bracken]]. When the film was released, ''Variety'' opined, \"Miss Lane, who's been absent from films for some time, gives a good enough performance which should ensure her work in more pictures.\" However, Lane returned to domestic life. Once again she and her husband moved, this time to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]].\n\nLane accepted the offer of the lead role opposite [[Lawrence Tierney]] in a [[film noir]], ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'' (1948), starring as Doris Brewster. During an interview with a Hollywood correspondent, she stated, \"I didn't realize how much I miss filming until I came back. I love this work, and I hope to make many, many more pictures.\" ''Bodyguard'' would be her last picture. An expected contract with [[RKO Studios]] did not come to pass.\n\nIn January 1951, Cora Mullican died at the [[San Fernando Valley]] home her daughters had bought for her years earlier. Priscilla returned to show business briefly in 1958 with her own show on a local television station broadcasting from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Titled ''The Priscilla Lane Show'', she chatted and interviewed celebrities visiting the area. She enjoyed the television experience, but family demands proved too much, and she gave up after a year.<ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{onesource|section|date=January 2019}}\nLane dated assistant director and screenwriter [[Oren W.

Impulsively she eloped with Haglund to [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], [[Arizona]], on January 14, 1939, but left him the following day. The marriage was soon annulled. In November 1941, Lane became engaged to publisher John Barry, whom she had first met in 1939. She wrote in the November issue of ''[[Photoplay]]'' about how she looked forward to their marriage and would continue her career.\n\nIn early 1942, the engagement to Barry ended after she met Joseph Howard, a young  Army Air Corps lieutenant, at a [[dude ranch]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. A native of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Massachusetts]], he had joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] straight from college in 1939. He was scouting the area for likely sites for air bases and had taken a short vacation. The couple were married on May 22, 1942, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], at the home of the executive officer of an Army Air Force gunnery school.\n\nAt the war's end in 1945, Lane and Howard were living in [[New Mexico]] and she was pregnant with their first child. Their son, Joseph Lawrence, was born on December 31, 1945. In 1946, after Howard's discharge from the service, the couple moved back to California, where they resided in [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]. Howard, who had a degree in engineering, became a building contractor. The family moved to [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]] in December 1945. Afterwards Howard and Lane moved to [[Studio City]]. Priscilla became pregnant again in 1949. On April 17, 1950, her daughter Hannah was born. By June 1951, the boom in the construction industry in [[New England]] had Lane and her family moving back to Howard's native Massachusetts. Howard left the final decision to end her career to Lane, who later declared she never regretted her choice. She fell in love with New England, and the couple settled with their children in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], Massachusetts. Lane was busy with her family. She gave birth to a second daughter, Judith, on August 22, 1953. The Howards' fourth and youngest child James was born December 4, 1955.

She was the youngest of five daughters of Dr. Lorenzo Mullican, DDS, and his wife, Cora Bell Hicks. Dr. Mullican had a dental practice in Indianola. The family owned a large house with 22 rooms, some of which they rented out to students attending nearby [[Simpson College]].\n\nPriscilla and one of her sisters, Rosemary, traveled to Des Moines every weekend to study dancing with Rose Lorenz, renown dance teacher<ref name=\"Betty Hill Dance\">{{ cite web|access-date=1 April 2020 |url=https://www.bettyhilldance.com/erabetty.htm |title=The Era of Miss Betty: 1955 to 1975}}</ref> at the time.  The girls made their first professional appearance September 30, 1930, at Des Moines' Paramount Theater. Priscilla, then 15, performed on stage as part of the entertainment accompanying the release of her sister Lola's Hollywood movie ''[[Good News (1930 film)|Good News]]'' (1930).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Priscilla was permitted to travel to New York to visit a third sister, Leota, who was then appearing in a musical revue in Manhattan. Priscilla enrolled at the nearby Fagen School of Dramatics, and Leota paid the fee. At this time, talent agent Al Altman saw Priscilla performing in one of Fagen's school plays and invited her to [[screentest]] for [[MGM]]. She was 16 years old. Priscilla wrote to a friend in Indianola, \"Leota accompanied me to a sort of theater in a New York skyscraper. Others were there being made up. One was a strange looking girl with her hair slicked back in a sort of a bun. Her name is said to be [[Katharine Hepburn|Catherine Hepburn]] [sic]. Not very pretty, I thought, but Mr. Altman said she has something. [[Margaret Sullavan]], the Broadway actress, was there too!\" A follow-up letter said that her test had proven unsuitable. Neither Hepburn nor Sullavan were approved, and neither received a contract from MGM at the time.\n\nIn 1932, Cora and Rosemary arrived in New York. Cora immediately went to work pushing her two young daughters into attending auditions for various prospective Broadway productions, without success. During a tryout at a music publishing office, orchestra leader and radio personality [[Fred Waring]] heard them harmonizing. He found them attractive and talented and soon signed them to a radio contract. Priscilla, who at this time adopted the surname Lane, quickly became known as the comedienne of the group. Rosemary sang the ballads, while Priscilla performed the swing numbers and wisecracked with Waring and various guests.  Back in Iowa, Dr. Mullican instituted divorce proceedings against his wife on the grounds of desertion, and the divorce was granted in 1933.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Priscilla Lane Cowboy from Brooklyn trailer.jpg|thumb|Priscilla Lane in ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', 1938]]\nRosemary and Priscilla remained with Fred Waring for almost five years. In 1937, Waring was engaged by [[Warner Bros.]] in Hollywood to appear with his entire band in ''[[Varsity Show (film)|Varsity Show]]'', a musical starring [[Dick Powell]]. Both Rosemary and Priscilla were tested and awarded feature roles in the film. Rosemary shared the romantic passages with Powell, while Priscilla played a high-spirited college girl.\n\nWarner Bros. purchased Priscilla and Rosemary's contract from Fred Waring and signed them to seven-year pacts.<ref name=\"independent\"/> Priscilla's first film after ''Varsity Show'' was ''[[Men Are Such Fools]]'' (1938), in which she starred with [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]]. This was followed by ''Love Honor and Behave'' (also 1938), another light romantic comedy with Morris, who, playing her husband, [[spanked]] her 47 times in a scene for which she declined a double, and ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', again teaming with Dick Powell. The publicity department at the studio suggested that Priscilla and Morris be seen together around town. They liked each other and did date for a period; however, Priscilla later said it was never serious on either side.\n\nPriscilla was next assigned the lead in ''[[Brother Rat]]'', which had been a very successful Broadway play. Again she played opposite Wayne Morris, and among the cast were newcomers [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Jane Bryan]], and [[Eddie Albert]]. The film, when released in October 1938, was a big success for all the young players. At this time of professional success, the sisters were informed that Dr. Mullican had died in Iowa.\n\nAfter winning her raise, Priscilla returned to work, but the films assigned to her were no better than those she had turned down. ''[[Brother Rat and a Baby]]'' (aka, ''Baby Be Good'', 1940) was an inferior sequel and ''[[Three Cheers for the Irish]]'' (also 1940) gave her little to do.\n\nThe British ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, always a supporter of the Lane Sisters, stated that all was not right with Priscilla Lane. In its June 15, 1940 issue, they wondered why \"Priscilla was still knocking at the door of major stardom\". They felt Warner Bros. was casting her as stooge to such actors as [[John Garfield]] and [[James Cagney]]. They went on to say Priscilla had great charm and while not a really great dramatic actress, deserved much larger and more important roles than she was getting. The same magazine, two years later on August 22, 1942, referred to their 1940 article and once again expressed disappointment at Warners' treatment of the star. They were unaware that she had already left the studio.\n\nOn April 28, 1941, she was heard on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' with [[George Brent]] and [[Gail Patrick]] in ''Wife, Husband and Friend''. At Warner Bros. she appeared opposite [[Ronald Reagan]] in a lighthearted comedy, ''[[Million Dollar Baby (1941 film)|Million Dollar Baby]]'' (1941) and as a night club singer in ''[[Blues in the Night]]'' (also 1941).\n\n[[Frank Capra]] requested her for the lead opposite [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. The comedy film was completed in early 1942, but was not released until 1944; it was held up by contractual agreement not to distribute the film until the play's long Broadway run was over. It was Priscilla's last Warner film. Her contract was terminated by mutual agreement after five years with the studio.\n\nShe freelanced next, signing a one-picture deal with [[Universal Studios]] where she starred with [[Robert Cummings]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). The director did not want either Cummings or Lane for their roles. Hitchcock felt Lane was too much the girl next door. Universal insisted that they play the leads, and when the film was released, her acting was praised while some criticism was focused on Hitchcock for reworking so much from his earlier films into this wartime spy drama.\n\nShe had commitments for two more films. The first was ''Silver Queen'' (1942) for producer [[Harry Sherman]] in which she co-starred with [[George Brent]]. She played the owner of a gambling house in 1870s San Francisco. The other film was a [[Jack Benny]] comedy, ''The Meanest Man in the World'', released in January 1943. Lane then retired from films. For the duration of the war, she followed her husband across America as he moved from one military base to another. She was generous with her talents and often performed at camp shows.\n\nWhile living in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], she was offered and accepted the leading role in ''Fun on a Weekend'' (1947) for producer\u2013director [[Andrew L. Stone|Andrew Stone]], co-starring [[Eddie Bracken]]. When the film was released, ''Variety'' opined, \"Miss Lane, who's been absent from films for some time, gives a good enough performance which should ensure her work in more pictures.\" However, Lane returned to domestic life. Once again she and her husband moved, this time to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]].\n\nLane accepted the offer of the lead role opposite [[Lawrence Tierney]] in a [[film noir]], ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'' (1948), starring as Doris Brewster. During an interview with a Hollywood correspondent, she stated, \"I didn't realize how much I miss filming until I came back. I love this work, and I hope to make many, many more pictures.\" ''Bodyguard'' would be her last picture. An expected contract with [[RKO Studios]] did not come to pass.\n\nIn January 1951, Cora Mullican died at the [[San Fernando Valley]] home her daughters had bought for her years earlier. Priscilla returned to show business briefly in 1958 with her own show on a local television station broadcasting from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Titled ''The Priscilla Lane Show'', she chatted and interviewed celebrities visiting the area. She enjoyed the television experience, but family demands proved too much, and she gave up after a year.<ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{onesource|section|date=January 2019}}\nLane dated assistant director and screenwriter [[Oren W. Haglund]], later the production manager of eleven [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[television series]] of the 1950s and 1960s.
