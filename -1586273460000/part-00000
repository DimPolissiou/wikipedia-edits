Eminescu was an active member of the [[Junimea]] literary society and worked as an editor for the newspaper ''[[Timpul]]'' (\"The Time\"), the official newspaper of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative Party]] (1880\u20131918).<ref>Mircea M\u00e2ciu dr., Nicolae C.

In his poems he frequently used metaphysical, mythological and historical subjects.\n\nHis father was Gheorghe Eminovici from C\u0103line\u0219ti, a [[Moldovans|Moldavian]] village in [[Suceava]] county, [[Bukovina|Bucovina]], which was then part of the [[Austrian Empire]] (while his father came from [[Banat]]). He crossed the border into [[Moldavia]], settling in [[Mihai Eminescu, Boto\u0219ani|Ipote\u0219ti]], near the town of [[Boto\u0219ani]]. He married Raluca Iura\u0219cu, an heiress of an old aristocratic Moldavian family. In a Junimea register, Eminescu wrote down his birthday date as 22 December 1849, while in the documents of [[Cern\u0103u\u0163i|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]] Gymnasium, where Eminescu studied, his birth date is 14 December 1849. Nevertheless, [[Titu Maiorescu]], in his work ''Eminescu and His Poems'' (1889) quoted N. D. Giurescu's research and adopted his conclusion regarding the date and place of Mihai Eminescu's birth, as being 15 January 1850, in Boto\u0219ani. This date resulted from several sources, among which there was a file of notes on christenings from the archives of the Uspenia (Domneasc\u0103) Church of Boto\u0219ani; inside this file, the date of birth was \"15 January 1850\" and the date of christening was the 21st of the same month. The date of his birth was confirmed by the poet's elder sister, Aglae Drogli, who affirmed that the place of birth was the village of Ipote\u0219ti.<ref>Titu Maiorescu, [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Eminescu_%C5%9Fi_poeziile_lui#Not.C4.83_asupra_zilei_.C5.9Fi_locului_na.C5.9Fterii_lui_Eminescu ''Eminescu \u015fi poeziile lui'' (1889)] (sec\u0163iunea \"Not\u0103 asupra zilei \u015fi locului na\u015fterii lui Eminescu\")</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Lui Mihai Eminescu, 1932, Oscar Han, Constan\u021ba, Romania.jpg|thumb|Lui Mihai Eminescu, 1932 [[Oscar Han]] sculpture, [[Constan\u021ba]]]]\nMihail (as he appears in baptismal records) or Mihai (the more common form of the name that he used) was born in {{ill|Botosani, Boto\u0219ani|ro||WD=|lt=Boto\u0219ani}}, [[Moldavia]]. He spent his early childhood in Boto\u0219ani and [[Mihai Eminescu, Boto\u0219ani|Ipote\u0219ti]], in his parents family home. From 1858 to 1866 he attended school in [[Cern\u0103u\u0163i|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]]. He finished 4th grade as the 5th of 82 students, after which he attended two years of ''[[Secondary education|gymnasium]]''. \nThe first evidence of Eminescu as a writer is in 1866. In January of that year [[Romanian language|Romanian]] teacher [[Aron Pumnul]] died and his students in [[Cernauti|Cern\u0103u\u0163i]] published a pamphlet, ''L\u0103cr\u0103mioarele \u00eenv\u0103\u021b\u0103ceilor gimnazia\u0219ti'' (''The Tears of the Gymnasium Students'') in which a poem entitled ''La morm\u00e2ntul lui Aron Pumnul'' (''At the Grave of Aron Pumnul'') appears, signed \"M. Eminovici\". On 25 February his poem ''De-a\u0219 avea'' (''If I Had'') was published in [[Iosif Vulcan]]'s literary magazine ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'' in [[Pest (city)|Pest]]. This began a steady series of published poems (and the occasional translation from German). Also, it was Iosif Vulcan, who disliked the Slavic source suffix \"''-ici''\" of the young poet's last name, that chose for him the more apparent Romanian \"[[nom de plume]]\" ''Mihai Eminescu''.\n\nIn 1867, he joined [[Iorgu Caragiale]]'s troupe as a clerk and prompter; the next year he transferred to [[Mihai Pascaly]]'s troupe. Both of these were among the leading Romanian theatrical troupes of their day, the latter including [[Matei Millo]] and {{ill|Fanny Tardini-Vl\u0103dicescu|ro|Compania Fanny Tardini - Vladicescu}}. He soon settled in [[Bucharest]], where at the end of November he became a clerk and copyist for the [[Romanian National Theater|National Theater]]. Throughout this period, he continued to write and publish poems. He also paid his rent by translating hundreds of pages of a book by [[Heinrich Theodor Rotscher]], although this never resulted in a completed work. Also at this time he began his novel ''Geniu pustiu'' (''Wasted Genius''), published posthumously in 1904 in an unfinished form.\n\nOn April 1, 1869, he was one of the co-founders of the \"Orient\" literary circle, whose interests included the gathering of Romanian folklore and documents relating to Romanian literary history. On 29 June, various members of the \"Orient\" group were commissioned to go to different provinces. Eminescu was assigned [[Moldavia]]. That summer, he quite by chance ran into his brother Iorgu, a military officer, in [[Ci\u015fmigiu Gardens|Ci\u0219migiu Gardens]], but firmly rebuffed Iorgu's attempt to get him to renew his ties to his family.\n\nStill in the summer of 1869, he left Pascaly's troupe and traveled to Cern\u0103u\u0163i and [[Ia\u015fi]]. He renewed ties to his family; his father promised him a regular allowance to pursue studies in [[Vienna]] in the fall. As always, he continued to write and publish poetry; notably, on the occasion of the death of the former ruler of [[Wallachia]], [[Barbu Dimitrie Stirbei|Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei]], he published a leaflet, ''La moartea principelui \u0218tirbei'' (\"On the Death of Prince \u0218tirbei\").\n\n\n===1870s===\n[[File:Copou Iasi 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Central University Library of Ia\u0219i|University's Central Library]] \"Mihai Eminescu\", [[Ia\u0219i]]]]\n\nFrom October 1869 to 1872 Eminescu studied in [[Vienna]]. Not fulfilling the requirements to become a university student (as he did not have a baccalaureate degree), he attended lectures as a so-called \"extraordinary auditor\" at the Faculty of Philosophy and Law. He was active in student life, befriended [[Ioan Slavici]], and came to know Vienna through [[Veronica Micle]]; he became a contributor to ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' (''Literary Conversations''), edited by ''[[Junimea]]'' (''The Youth''). The leaders of this cultural organisation, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Vasile Pogor]], [[Theodor Rosetti]], [[Iacob Negruzzi]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]], exercised their political and cultural influence over Eminescu for the rest of his life. Impressed by one of Eminescu's poems, ''Venere \u015fi Madon\u0103'' (''Venus and Madonna''), [[Iacob Negruzzi]], the editor of ''Convorbiri Literare'', traveled to Vienna to meet him. Negruzzi would later write how he could pick Eminescu out of a crowd of young people in a Viennese caf\u00e9 by his \"romantic\" appearance: long hair and gaze lost in thoughts.\n\nIn 1870 Eminescu wrote three articles under the pseudonym \"Varro\" in ''Federa\u0163iunea'' in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], on the situation of Romanians and other minorities in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He then became a journalist for the newspaper ''[[Albina (newspaper)|Albina]]'' (''The Bee'') in Pest. From 1872 to 1874 he continued as a student in [[Berlin]], thanks to a stipend offered by ''Junimea''.\n\nFrom 1874 to 1877, he worked as director of the [[Central University Library of Ia\u0219i|Central Library]] in [[Ia\u0219i]], substitute teacher, school inspector for the counties of Ia\u0219i and [[Vaslui]], and editor of the newspaper ''Curierul de Ia\u0219i'' (''The Courier of Ia\u015fi''), all thanks to his friendship with [[Titu Maiorescu]], the leader of [[Junimea]] and rector of the [[University of Ia\u0219i]]. He continued to publish in ''Convorbiri Literare''. He also was a good friend of [[Ion Creang\u0103]], a writer, whom he convinced to become a writer and introduced to the ''Junimea'' literary club.\n\nIn 1877 he moved to [[Bucharest]], where until 1883 he was first journalist, then (1880) editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''[[Timpul]]'' (''The Time''). During this time he wrote ''Scrisorile'', ''Luceaf\u0103rul'',  ''Od\u0103 \u00een metru antic'' etc. Most of his notable editorial pieces belong to this period, when Romania was fighting the Ottoman Empire in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] and throughout the diplomatic race that eventually brought about the international recognition of Romanian independence, but under the condition of bestowing Romanian citizenship to all subjects of Jewish faith. Eminescu opposed this and another clause of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]]: Romania's having to give southern [[Bessarabia]] to Russia in exchange for Northern [[Dobrudja]], a former Ottoman province on the [[Black Sea]].\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Jean Bielig - Mihai Eminescu - copy.jpg|thumb|left|Last photo of Eminescu taken by Jean Bieling in 1887\u20131888]]\n\nThe 1880s were a time of crisis and deterioration in the poet's life, culminating with his death in 1889. The details of this are still debated.\n\nFrom 1883 - when Eminescu's personal crisis and his more problematic health issues became evident - until 1886, the poet was treated in Austria and Italy, by specialists that managed to get him on his feet, as testified by his good friend, writer [[Ioan Slavici]].<ref name=\"bolile\" /> In 1886, Eminescu suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was treated by Romanian doctors, in particular Julian Bogdan and Panait Zosin. Immediately diagnosed with syphilis, after being hospitalized in a nervous diseases hospice within the [[Neam\u021b Monastery]],<ref name=\"rtv\" /> the poet was treated with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. Firstly, massages in [[Boto\u0219ani]], applied by Dr. Itszak, and then in Bucharest at Dr. [[Alexandru A.

He also says that the poet was \"treated\" by a group of incompetent doctors and held in misery, which also shortened his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evz.ro/125-de-ani-de-la-moartea-lui-mihai-eminescu-au-pus-la-cale-serviciile-secrete-eliminarea-poetului-national.html |title=125 de ani de la moartea lui MIHAI EMINESCU.

In the following decade, Eminescu's notability as a poet grew continually thanks to (1) the way he managed to enrich the literary language with words and phrases from all Romanian regions, from old texts, and with new words that he coined from his wide philosophical readings; (2) the use of bold metaphors, much too rare in earlier Romanian poetry; (3) last but not least, he was arguably the first Romanian writer who published in all Romanian provinces and was constantly interested in the problems of Romanians everywhere. He defined himself as a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], in a poem addressed ''To My Critics'' (''Criticilor mei''), and this designation, his untimely death as well as his bohemian lifestyle (he never pursued a degree, a position, a wife or fortune) had him associated with the Romantic figure of the [[genius]]. As early as the late 1880s, Eminescu had a group of faithful followers. His 1883 poem ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' was so notable that a new literary review took its name after it.\n\nThe most realistic psychological analysis of [[Eminescu]] was written by [[I.L. Caragiale|I. L. Caragiale]], who, after the poet's death published three short care articles on this subject: ''In Nirvana'', ''Irony'' and ''Two notes''. [[Caragiale]] stated that Eminescu's characteristic feature was the fact that \"he had an excessively unique nature\".<ref>I.L.

Strange medley! \u2013 happy for an artist, unhappy for a man!}}\n\nThe portrait that [[Titu Maiorescu]] made in the study ''Eminescu and poems'' emphasizes [[Eminescu]]'s [[introvert]] dominant traits. [[Titu Maiorescu]] promoted the image of a dreamer who was far away from reality, who did not suffer because of the material conditions that he lived in, regardless of all the ironies and eulogies of his neighbour, his main characteristic was \"abstract serenity\".<ref>Titu Maiorescu, ''Critice'', vol. II, Editura pentru literatur\u0103, Bucure\u015fti, 1967, pag. 333</ref>\n\nIn reality, just as one can discover from his poems and letters and just as [[Caragiale]] remembered, Eminescu was seldom influenced by boisterous [[subconscious]] motivations. Eminescu's life was but an overlap of different-sized cycles, made of sudden bursts that were nurtured by dreams and crises due to the impact with reality. The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, such as his relation with [[Veronica Micle|Veronica]], his political activity during his years as a student, or the fact that he attended the gatherings at the ''[[Junimea]]'' society or the articles he published in the newspaper ''[[Timpul (newspaper)|Timpul]]''. He used to have a unique manner of describing his own crisis of jealousy.<ref>Dulcea mea Doamn\u0103 / Eminul meu iubit.

I sometimes hate you because I know you own all these allures that you charmed me with, I hate you when I suspect you might give away my fortune, my only fortune.

A major obstacle to their fully embracing him was the fact he never identified himself as a Christian{{Citation needed|reason=Eminescu loved Orthodox Church and said: \"The one who combats Orthodox Chruch is not Romanian.\"|date=October 2017}} and his poetry rather uses pagan and folkloric themes.\n\nAfter a decade when Eminescu's works were criticized as \"mystic\" and \"bourgeois\", Romanian Communists ended by adopting Eminescu as ''the'' major Romanian poet. What opened the door for this thaw was the poem ''\u00cemp\u0103rat \u0219i proletar'' (''Emperor and [[Proletariat|proletarian]]'') that Eminescu wrote under the influence of the [[Paris Commune|1870\u20131871 events]] in France, and which ended in a [[Schopenhauerian]] critique of human life. An expurgated version only showed the stanzas that could present Eminescu as a poet interested in the fate of proletarians.\n\nIt has also been revealed that Eminescu demanded strong anti-Jewish legislation on the German model, saying, among other things, that \"the Jew does not deserve any rights anywhere in Europe because he is not working.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ioanid|first=Radu|year=1996|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|editor1-last=Wyman|editor1-first=David S.|title=The Worls Reacts to the Holocaust|location=Baltimore, Maryland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6KVOsjpP0MC&printsec=frontcover|page=228}}</ref> This was not, however, an unusual stance to take in the cultural and literary milieu of his age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dietrich | first1 = D.J. | year = 1988 | title = National renewal, anti-Semitism, and political continuity: A psychological assessment | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 385\u2013411 | doi=10.2307/3791721}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*[[George C\u0103linescu]], ''La vie d'Eminescu'', Bucarest: Univers, 1989, 439 p.\n* Marin Bucur (ed.), ''Caietele Mihai Eminescu'', Bucure\u0219ti, Editura Eminescu, 1972\n* Mur\u0103ra\u0219u, Dumitru (1983), ''Mihai Eminescu.

In his poems he frequently used metaphysical, mythological and historical subjects.\n\nHis father was Gheorghe Eminovici from C\u0103line\u0219ti, a [[Moldovans|Moldavian]] village in [[Suceava]] county, [[Bukovina|Bucovina]], which was then part of the [[Austrian Empire]] (while his father came from [[Banat]]). He crossed the border into [[Moldavia]], settling in [[Mihai Eminescu, Boto\u0219ani|Ipote\u0219ti]], near the town of [[Boto\u0219ani]]. He married Raluca Iura\u0219cu, an heiress of an old aristocratic Moldavian family. In a Junimea register, Eminescu wrote down his birthday date as 22 December 1849, while in the documents of [[Cern\u0103u\u0163i|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]] Gymnasium, where Eminescu studied, his birth date is 14 December 1849. Nevertheless, [[Titu Maiorescu]], in his work ''Eminescu and His Poems'' (1889) quoted N. D. Giurescu's research and adopted his conclusion regarding the date and place of Mihai Eminescu's birth, as being 15 January 1850, in Boto\u0219ani. This date resulted from several sources, among which there was a file of notes on christenings from the archives of the Uspenia (Domneasc\u0103) Church of Boto\u0219ani; inside this file, the date of birth was \"15 January 1850\" and the date of christening was the 21st of the same month. The date of his birth was confirmed by the poet's elder sister, Aglae Drogli, who affirmed that the place of birth was the village of Ipote\u0219ti.<ref>Titu Maiorescu, [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Eminescu_%C5%9Fi_poeziile_lui#Not.C4.83_asupra_zilei_.C5.9Fi_locului_na.C5.9Fterii_lui_Eminescu ''Eminescu \u015fi poeziile lui'' (1889)] (sec\u0163iunea \"Not\u0103 asupra zilei \u015fi locului na\u015fterii lui Eminescu\")</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Lui Mihai Eminescu, 1932, Oscar Han, Constan\u021ba, Romania.jpg|thumb|Lui Mihai Eminescu, 1932 [[Oscar Han]] sculpture, [[Constan\u021ba]]]]\nMihail (as he appears in baptismal records) or Mihai (the more common form of the name that he used) was born in {{ill|Botosani, Boto\u0219ani|ro||WD=|lt=Boto\u0219ani}}, [[Moldavia]]. He spent his early childhood in Boto\u0219ani and [[Mihai Eminescu, Boto\u0219ani|Ipote\u0219ti]], in his parents family home. From 1858 to 1866 he attended school in [[Cern\u0103u\u0163i|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]]. He finished 4th grade as the 5th of 82 students, after which he attended two years of ''[[Secondary education|gymnasium]]''. \nThe first evidence of Eminescu as a writer is in 1866. In January of that year [[Romanian language|Romanian]] teacher [[Aron Pumnul]] died and his students in [[Cernauti|Cern\u0103u\u0163i]] published a pamphlet, ''L\u0103cr\u0103mioarele \u00eenv\u0103\u021b\u0103ceilor gimnazia\u0219ti'' (''The Tears of the Gymnasium Students'') in which a poem entitled ''La morm\u00e2ntul lui Aron Pumnul'' (''At the Grave of Aron Pumnul'') appears, signed \"M. Eminovici\". On 25 February his poem ''De-a\u0219 avea'' (''If I Had'') was published in [[Iosif Vulcan]]'s literary magazine ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'' in [[Pest (city)|Pest]]. This began a steady series of published poems (and the occasional translation from German). Also, it was Iosif Vulcan, who disliked the Slavic source suffix \"''-ici''\" of the young poet's last name, that chose for him the more apparent Romanian \"[[nom de plume]]\" ''Mihai Eminescu''.\n\nIn 1867, he joined [[Iorgu Caragiale]]'s troupe as a clerk and prompter; the next year he transferred to [[Mihai Pascaly]]'s troupe. Both of these were among the leading Romanian theatrical troupes of their day, the latter including [[Matei Millo]] and {{ill|Fanny Tardini-Vl\u0103dicescu|ro|Compania Fanny Tardini - Vladicescu}}. He soon settled in [[Bucharest]], where at the end of November he became a clerk and copyist for the [[Romanian National Theater|National Theater]]. Throughout this period, he continued to write and publish poems. He also paid his rent by translating hundreds of pages of a book by [[Heinrich Theodor Rotscher]], although this never resulted in a completed work. Also at this time he began his novel ''Geniu pustiu'' (''Wasted Genius''), published posthumously in 1904 in an unfinished form.\n\nOn April 1, 1869, he was one of the co-founders of the \"Orient\" literary circle, whose interests included the gathering of Romanian folklore and documents relating to Romanian literary history. On 29 June, various members of the \"Orient\" group were commissioned to go to different provinces. Eminescu was assigned [[Moldavia]]. That summer, he quite by chance ran into his brother Iorgu, a military officer, in [[Ci\u015fmigiu Gardens|Ci\u0219migiu Gardens]], but firmly rebuffed Iorgu's attempt to get him to renew his ties to his family.\n\nStill in the summer of 1869, he left Pascaly's troupe and traveled to Cern\u0103u\u0163i and [[Ia\u015fi]]. He renewed ties to his family; his father promised him a regular allowance to pursue studies in [[Vienna]] in the fall. As always, he continued to write and publish poetry; notably, on the occasion of the death of the former ruler of [[Wallachia]], [[Barbu Dimitrie Stirbei|Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei]], he published a leaflet, ''La moartea principelui \u0218tirbei'' (\"On the Death of Prince \u0218tirbei\").\n\n\n===1870s===\n[[File:Copou Iasi 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Central University Library of Ia\u0219i|University's Central Library]] \"Mihai Eminescu\", [[Ia\u0219i]]]]\n\nFrom October 1869 to 1872 Eminescu studied in [[Vienna]]. Not fulfilling the requirements to become a university student (as he did not have a baccalaureate degree), he attended lectures as a so-called \"extraordinary auditor\" at the Faculty of Philosophy and Law. He was active in student life, befriended [[Ioan Slavici]], and came to know Vienna through [[Veronica Micle]]; he became a contributor to ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' (''Literary Conversations''), edited by ''[[Junimea]]'' (''The Youth''). The leaders of this cultural organisation, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Vasile Pogor]], [[Theodor Rosetti]], [[Iacob Negruzzi]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]], exercised their political and cultural influence over Eminescu for the rest of his life. Impressed by one of Eminescu's poems, ''Venere \u015fi Madon\u0103'' (''Venus and Madonna''), [[Iacob Negruzzi]], the editor of ''Convorbiri Literare'', traveled to Vienna to meet him. Negruzzi would later write how he could pick Eminescu out of a crowd of young people in a Viennese caf\u00e9 by his \"romantic\" appearance: long hair and gaze lost in thoughts.\n\nIn 1870 Eminescu wrote three articles under the pseudonym \"Varro\" in ''Federa\u0163iunea'' in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], on the situation of Romanians and other minorities in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He then became a journalist for the newspaper ''[[Albina (newspaper)|Albina]]'' (''The Bee'') in Pest. From 1872 to 1874 he continued as a student in [[Berlin]], thanks to a stipend offered by ''Junimea''.\n\nFrom 1874 to 1877, he worked as director of the [[Central University Library of Ia\u0219i|Central Library]] in [[Ia\u0219i]], substitute teacher, school inspector for the counties of Ia\u0219i and [[Vaslui]], and editor of the newspaper ''Curierul de Ia\u0219i'' (''The Courier of Ia\u015fi''), all thanks to his friendship with [[Titu Maiorescu]], the leader of [[Junimea]] and rector of the [[University of Ia\u0219i]]. He continued to publish in ''Convorbiri Literare''. He also was a good friend of [[Ion Creang\u0103]], a writer, whom he convinced to become a writer and introduced to the ''Junimea'' literary club.\n\nIn 1877 he moved to [[Bucharest]], where until 1883 he was first journalist, then (1880) editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''[[Timpul]]'' (''The Time''). During this time he wrote ''Scrisorile'', ''Luceaf\u0103rul'',  ''Od\u0103 \u00een metru antic'' etc. Most of his notable editorial pieces belong to this period, when Romania was fighting the Ottoman Empire in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] and throughout the diplomatic race that eventually brought about the international recognition of Romanian independence, but under the condition of bestowing Romanian citizenship to all subjects of Jewish faith. Eminescu opposed this and another clause of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]]: Romania's having to give southern [[Bessarabia]] to Russia in exchange for Northern [[Dobrudja]], a former Ottoman province on the [[Black Sea]].\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Jean Bielig - Mihai Eminescu - copy.jpg|thumb|left|Last photo of Eminescu taken by Jean Bieling in 1887\u20131888]]\n\nThe 1880s were a time of crisis and deterioration in the poet's life, culminating with his death in 1889. The details of this are still debated.\n\nFrom 1883 - when Eminescu's personal crisis and his more problematic health issues became evident - until 1886, the poet was treated in Austria and Italy, by specialists that managed to get him on his feet, as testified by his good friend, writer [[Ioan Slavici]].<ref name=\"bolile\" /> In 1886, Eminescu suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was treated by Romanian doctors, in particular Julian Bogdan and Panait Zosin.

Firstly, massages in [[Boto\u0219ani]], applied by Dr. Itszak, and then in Bucharest at Dr. [[Alexandru A.

In the following decade, Eminescu's notability as a poet grew continually thanks to (1) the way he managed to enrich the literary language with words and phrases from all Romanian regions, from old texts, and with new words that he coined from his wide philosophical readings; (2) the use of bold metaphors, much too rare in earlier Romanian poetry; (3) last but not least, he was arguably the first Romanian writer who published in all Romanian provinces and was constantly interested in the problems of Romanians everywhere. He defined himself as a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], in a poem addressed ''To My Critics'' (''Criticilor mei''), and this designation, his untimely death as well as his bohemian lifestyle (he never pursued a degree, a position, a wife or fortune) had him associated with the Romantic figure of the [[genius]]. As early as the late 1880s, Eminescu had a group of faithful followers. His 1883 poem ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' was so notable that a new literary review took its name after it.\n\nThe most realistic psychological analysis of [[Eminescu]] was written by [[I.L. Caragiale|I. L. Caragiale]], who, after the poet's death published three short care articles on this subject: ''In Nirvana'', ''Irony'' and ''Two notes''. [[Caragiale]] stated that Eminescu's characteristic feature was the fact that \"he had an excessively unique nature\".<ref>I.L. Caragiale, ''\u00cen Nirvana'', \u00een ''Ei l-au v\u0103zut pe Eminescu'', Antologie de texte de Cristina Cr\u0103ciun \u015fi Victor Cr\u0103ciun, Editura Dacia, Cluj-Napoca, 1989, pag. 148</ref> Eminescu's life was a continuous oscillation between [[introvert]] and [[extrovert]] attitudes.<ref>I.L.

Strange medley! \u2013 happy for an artist, unhappy for a man!}}\n\nThe portrait that [[Titu Maiorescu]] made in the study ''Eminescu and poems'' emphasizes [[Eminescu]]'s [[introvert]] dominant traits. [[Titu Maiorescu]] promoted the image of a dreamer who was far away from reality, who did not suffer because of the material conditions that he lived in, regardless of all the ironies and eulogies of his neighbour, his main characteristic was \"abstract serenity\".<ref>Titu Maiorescu, ''Critice'', vol. II, Editura pentru literatur\u0103, Bucure\u015fti, 1967, pag. 333</ref>\n\nIn reality, just as one can discover from his poems and letters and just as [[Caragiale]] remembered, Eminescu was seldom influenced by boisterous [[subconscious]] motivations. Eminescu's life was but an overlap of different-sized cycles, made of sudden bursts that were nurtured by dreams and crises due to the impact with reality. The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, such as his relation with [[Veronica Micle|Veronica]], his political activity during his years as a student, or the fact that he attended the gatherings at the ''[[Junimea]]'' society or the articles he published in the newspaper ''[[Timpul (newspaper)|Timpul]]''. He used to have a unique manner of describing his own crisis of jealousy.<ref>Dulcea mea Doamn\u0103 / Eminul meu iubit.

I sometimes hate you because I know you own all these allures that you charmed me with, I hate you when I suspect you might give away my fortune, my only fortune. I could only be happy beside you if we were far away from all the other people, somewhere, so that I didn't have to show you to anybody and I could be relaxed only if I could keep you locked up in a bird house in which only I could enter.}}\n\n===National poet===\n\nHe was soon proclaimed Romania's [[national poet]], not because he wrote in an age of national revival, but rather because he was received as an author of paramount significance by Romanians in all provinces.

A major obstacle to their fully embracing him was the fact he never identified himself as a Christian{{Citation needed|reason=Eminescu loved Orthodox Church and said: \"The one who combats Orthodox Chruch is not Romanian.\"|date=October 2017}} and his poetry rather uses pagan and folkloric themes.\n\nAfter a decade when Eminescu's works were criticized as \"mystic\" and \"bourgeois\", Romanian Communists ended by adopting Eminescu as ''the'' major Romanian poet. What opened the door for this thaw was the poem ''\u00cemp\u0103rat \u0219i proletar'' (''Emperor and [[Proletariat|proletarian]]'') that Eminescu wrote under the influence of the [[Paris Commune|1870\u20131871 events]] in France, and which ended in a [[Schopenhauerian]] critique of human life.

He founded a [[Meat packing industry|meat-packing]] empire in the [[Midwest]] during the late 19th century, over which he presided until his death. He is credited with the development of the first practical ice-cooled [[railroad car]], which allowed his company to ship dressed meats to all parts of the country and abroad, ushering in the \"era of cheap beef.\" Swift pioneered the use of [[animal]] by-products for the manufacture of soap, glue, [[fertilizer]], various types of sundries, and even medical products.<ref name=obit/>\n\nSwift donated large sums of money to such institutions as the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], and [[YMCA]]. He established [[Northwestern University]]'s \"School of Oratory\" in memory of his daughter, Annie May Swift, who died while a student there. When he died in 1903, his company was valued at between [[US$]]125 million and $135 million, and had a workforce of more than 21,000. \"The House of Swift\" slaughtered as many as two million cattle, four million hogs, and two million sheep a year. Three years after his death, the value of the company's capital stock topped $250 million. He and his family are interred in a [[mausoleum]] in [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Chicago)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Biography==\n\nSwift was born on June 24, 1839 in [[Sagamore, Massachusetts]], the 9th of 12 offspring of William Swift and Sally Crowell. His parents were descendants of [[United Kingdom|British]] settlers who went to [[New England]] in the 17th century. The family (which included Gustavus\u2019 brothers Noble and Edwin) lived and worked on a farm in the [[Cape Cod]] town of West [[Sandwich, Massachusetts]]  where they raised and slaughtered [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[Hog (swine)|hogs]]. This is where he got the idea of packing meat.\n\nAs a young boy, Swift took little interest in his studies and left the nearby country school after eight years. During that period he was employed in several jobs, finally finding full-time work in his elder brother Noble's [[butcher]] shop at the age of fourteen. Two years later, in 1855, he opened his own cattle and [[pork]] butchering business with the help of one of his uncles who gave him $400. Swift purchased [[livestock]] at the market in [[Brighton]] and drove them to [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]], a ten-day journey. A shrewd businessman, he purportedly followed the somewhat common practice of denying his herds water during the last miles of the trip so that they would drink large quantities of liquid once they reached their final destination, effectively boosting their weights. Swift married Annie Maria Higgins of [[North Eastham]] in 1861. Annie gave birth to eleven children, nine of whom reached adulthood. In 1862, Swift and his new bride opened a small butcher shop and [[slaughterhouse]]. Seven years later Gustavus and Annie moved the family to Brighton (near [[Boston]]), where in 1872 Swift became partner in a new venture, ''Hathaway and Swift''. Swift and partner James A. Hathaway (a renowned Boston meat dealer) initially relocated the company to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], then almost immediately thereafter to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].\n\nAn astute cattle-buyer, Swift followed the market steadily westward. On his recommendation, Hathaway and Swift moved once more in 1875, this time to join the influx of meat packers setting up shop in [[Chicago]]'s sprawling [[Union Stock Yards]]. Swift established himself as one of the dominant figures of \"The Yards\", and his distinctive delivery wagons became familiar fixtures on Chicago's streets. In 1878 his partnership with Hathaway  and ''Swift Bros and Company'' was formed in partnership with younger brother Edwin. The company became a driving force in the Chicago [[meat packing industry]], and was incorporated in 1885 as ''[[Swift & Company|Swift & Co.]]'' with $300,000 in capital stock and Gustavus Swift as president. It is from this position that Swift led the way in revolutionizing how meat was processed, delivered, and sold.\n\nHe died on March 29, 1903 at his home 4848 Ellis Avenue in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |title=Gustavus F.

Driving cattle across the plains led to tremendous weight loss, and a number of animals died in transit. Upon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were either [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt.\n\nCertain inefficiencies were inherent in the process of transporting live animals by rail, particularly due to the fact that approximately 60% of the animal's mass is inedible. Many animals weakened by the long drive died in transit, further increasing the per-unit shipping cost. Swift's solution to these problems was to devise a method to ship dressed meats from his packing plant in Chicago to the East.\n\n==Advent of the refrigerator car==\n{{main|Refrigerator car}}\n[[Image:Early refrigerator car design circa 1870.jpg|thumb|left|An early refrigerator car design, ''circa'' 1870. Hatches in the roof provided access to the ice tanks at each end of the car.]]\n\nA number of attempts were made during the mid-19th century to ship [[agriculture|agricultural]] products via rail car. As early as 1842 the [[Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] was reported in the June 15 edition of the ''Boston Traveler'' to be experimenting with innovative [[freight car]] designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage.<ref>White, p. 31</ref> The first known [[refrigerator car|refrigerated boxcar]] or \"reefer\" entered service on the [[Northern Railroad (New York)]] (or NRNY, which became part of the [[Rutland Railroad]]) in June 1851. This \"icebox on wheels\" was a limited success in that it was only able to function in cold weather. That same year, the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad]] (O&LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, utilizing ice to cool the contents.\n\nThe first consignment of dressed beef to leave the Chicago stockyards was in 1857, and was carried in ordinary [[boxcar]]s retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing the meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, hence proved impractical. During the same period Swift experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars which ran with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to [[New York City]] during the winter months over the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical. [[Detroit]]'s William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. He sold the design in 1868 to [[George Hammond (industrialist)|George H. Hammond]], a Detroit meat-packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the [[Great Lakes]] for cooling.<ref>White, p. 33</ref> The loads had the unfortunate tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and the use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well-insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward.<ref>White, p. 45</ref>\n\nThe meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the [[center of gravity]] low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a practical solution to providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, and allowed Swift & Company to ship their products all over the [[United States]], and internationally. This radically altered the meat business. Swift's attempts to sell this design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in [[Stock car (rail)|stock cars]] and animal pens if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then &mdash; when the [[United States|American]] railroads refused his business &mdash; he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul them into [[Michigan]] and then eastward through [[Canada]]. In 1880, the [[Peninsular Car Company]] (subsequently purchased by [[American Car & Foundry]]) delivered to Swift the first of these units, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year the Line's roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to Boston. Competing firms such as [[Armour and Company]] quickly followed. By 1920 the SRL owned and operated 7,000 ice-cooled rail cars. The [[General American Transportation Corporation]] assumed ownership of the line in 1930.\n\n<br />\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:One of the first cars out of the Detroit plant of American Car & Foundry - Built 1899 for Swift Refrigerator Line - Chicago Historical Society.jpg|thumb|A builder's photo of one of the first refrigerator cars to come out of the [[Detroit]] plant of the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] (ACF), built in 1899 for the [[Swift Refrigerator Line]].]] -->\n\n'''Live cattle and dressed beef deliveries to New York ([[ton]]s):'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n|\n|align=center | ''(Stock Cars)''\n|align=center | ''(Refrigerator Cars)''\n|-\n|align=center | &nbsp; '''Year &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Live Cattle &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Dressed Beef'''\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1882\n|align=center | 366,487\n|align=center | 2,633\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1883\n|align=center | 392,095\n|align=center | 16,365\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1884\n|align=center | 328,220\n|align=center | 34,956\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1885\n|align=center | 337,820\n|align=center | 53,344\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1886\n|align=center | 280,184\n|align=center | 69,769\n|}\n\n<small>The subject cars travelled on the [[Erie Railroad|Erie]], [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna]], [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]], and [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] railroads.</small>\n\n<small>Source: ''Railway Review'', January 29, 1887, p.&nbsp;62.</small>\n\n==\"Everything but the squeal\"==\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:X-24337.jpg|thumb|This interior view of a [[slaughterhouse]] shows men working with [[pork]] [[carcass]]es and [[viscera]] sometime between 1910 and 1930.]] -->\nIn response to public outcries to reduce the amount of pollutants generated by his packing plants, Swift sought innovative ways to use previously discarded portions of the animals his company butchered. This practice led to the wide scale commercial production of such diverse products as [[oleomargarine]], [[soap]], [[glue]], [[fertilizer]], hairbrushes, buttons, knife handles, and [[pharmaceutical]] preparations such as [[pepsin]] and [[insulin]]. Low-grade meats were canned in products like [[pork and beans]].\n\nThe absence of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] inspection led to abuses. Sausages might incorporate rat droppings, dead rodents, and sawdust, and meat that had spoiled or meat mixed with waste materials was sometimes packed and sold. (Swift once bragged that his slaughterhouses had become so sophisticated that they used \"everything but the squeal.\") Transgressions such as these were first documented in [[Upton Sinclair|Upton Sinclair's]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', the publication of which shocked the nation and led to the passing of the [[Meat Inspection Act|Federal Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906.<ref name=Kutner>Kutner</ref>\n\n==Vertical integration==\n[[Image:Swift Brands South Chicago IL meat packing plant circa 1917.jpg|thumb|A view of the '''Swift Brands''' [[Sioux City, Iowa]] meat packing plant, ''circa'' 1917.

These practices symbolize the concept of \"rationalized organization of work\" to this day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSwift adapted the methods of the industrial revolution to meat packing operations, which resulted in huge efficiency by allowing his plants to produce on a massive scale. The work was divided into myriad specific sub-tasks, which were carried out under the direction of supervisory personnel. Swift & Co. was broken down organizationally into various divisions, each one responsible for conducting a different aspect of the business of \"bringing meat from the ranch to the consumer\". By developing a [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] company, Swift was able to control the sale of his meats from the slaughterhouse to the local butcher shop.<ref>Chandler, p. 70</ref>\n\nSwift devoted a great deal of time to indoctrinating employees and teaching them the company's methods and policies. He also motivated his employees to focus on the company's profit goals by adhering to a strict policy of promotion from within. The innovations that Swift championed not only revolutionized the meat packing industry, but also played a vital role in establishing the modern American business system, with an emphasis on [[mass production]], functional specialization, managerial expertise, national distribution networks, and adaptation to technological innovation.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n*Boyle, Elizabeth and Rodolfo Estrada.

He founded a [[Meat packing industry|meat-packing]] empire in the [[Midwest]] during the late 19th century, over which he presided until his death. He is credited with the development of the first practical ice-cooled [[railroad car]], which allowed his company to ship dressed meats to all parts of the country and abroad, ushering in the \"era of cheap beef.\" Swift pioneered the use of [[animal]] by-products for the manufacture of soap, glue, [[fertilizer]], various types of sundries, and even medical products.<ref name=obit/>\n\nSwift donated large sums of money to such institutions as the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], and [[YMCA]]. He established [[Northwestern University]]'s \"School of Oratory\" in memory of his daughter, Annie May Swift, who died while a student there. When he died in 1903, his company was valued at between [[US$]]125 million and $135 million, and had a workforce of more than 21,000. \"The House of Swift\" slaughtered as many as two million cattle, four million hogs, and two million sheep a year. Three years after his death, the value of the company's capital stock topped $250 million. He and his family are interred in a [[mausoleum]] in [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Chicago)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Biography==\n\nSwift was born on June 24, 1839 in [[Sagamore, Massachusetts]], the 9th of 12 offspring of William Swift and Sally Crowell. His parents were descendants of [[United Kingdom|British]] settlers who went to [[New England]] in the 17th century. The family (which included Gustavus\u2019 brothers Noble and Edwin) lived and worked on a farm in the [[Cape Cod]] town of West [[Sandwich, Massachusetts]]  where they raised and slaughtered [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[Hog (swine)|hogs]]. This is where he got the idea of packing meat.\n\nAs a young boy, Swift took little interest in his studies and left the nearby country school after eight years. During that period he was employed in several jobs, finally finding full-time work in his elder brother Noble's [[butcher]] shop at the age of fourteen. Two years later, in 1855, he opened his own cattle and [[pork]] butchering business with the help of one of his uncles who gave him $400. Swift purchased [[livestock]] at the market in [[Brighton]] and drove them to [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]], a ten-day journey. A shrewd businessman, he purportedly followed the somewhat common practice of denying his herds water during the last miles of the trip so that they would drink large quantities of liquid once they reached their final destination, effectively boosting their weights. Swift married Annie Maria Higgins of [[North Eastham]] in 1861. Annie gave birth to eleven children, nine of whom reached adulthood. In 1862, Swift and his new bride opened a small butcher shop and [[slaughterhouse]]. Seven years later Gustavus and Annie moved the family to Brighton (near [[Boston]]), where in 1872 Swift became partner in a new venture, ''Hathaway and Swift''. Swift and partner James A. Hathaway (a renowned Boston meat dealer) initially relocated the company to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], then almost immediately thereafter to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].\n\nAn astute cattle-buyer, Swift followed the market steadily westward. On his recommendation, Hathaway and Swift moved once more in 1875, this time to join the influx of meat packers setting up shop in [[Chicago]]'s sprawling [[Union Stock Yards]]. Swift established himself as one of the dominant figures of \"The Yards\", and his distinctive delivery wagons became familiar fixtures on Chicago's streets. In 1878 his partnership with Hathaway  and ''Swift Bros and Company'' was formed in partnership with younger brother Edwin. The company became a driving force in the Chicago [[meat packing industry]], and was incorporated in 1885 as ''[[Swift & Company|Swift & Co.]]'' with $300,000 in capital stock and Gustavus Swift as president. It is from this position that Swift led the way in revolutionizing how meat was processed, delivered, and sold.\n\nHe died on March 29, 1903 at his home 4848 Ellis Avenue in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |title=Gustavus F.

Driving cattle across the plains led to tremendous weight loss, and a number of animals died in transit. Upon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were either [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt.\n\nCertain inefficiencies were inherent in the process of transporting live animals by rail, particularly due to the fact that approximately 60% of the animal's mass is inedible. Many animals weakened by the long drive died in transit, further increasing the per-unit shipping cost. Swift's solution to these problems was to devise a method to ship dressed meats from his packing plant in Chicago to the East.\n\n==Advent of the refrigerator car==\n{{main|Refrigerator car}}\n[[Image:Early refrigerator car design circa 1870.jpg|thumb|left|An early refrigerator car design, ''circa'' 1870. Hatches in the roof provided access to the ice tanks at each end of the car.]]\n\nA number of attempts were made during the mid-19th century to ship [[agriculture|agricultural]] products via rail car. As early as 1842 the [[Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] was reported in the June 15 edition of the ''Boston Traveler'' to be experimenting with innovative [[freight car]] designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage.<ref>White, p. 31</ref> The first known [[refrigerator car|refrigerated boxcar]] or \"reefer\" entered service on the [[Northern Railroad (New York)]] (or NRNY, which became part of the [[Rutland Railroad]]) in June 1851. This \"icebox on wheels\" was a limited success in that it was only able to function in cold weather. That same year, the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad]] (O&LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, utilizing ice to cool the contents.\n\nThe first consignment of dressed beef to leave the Chicago stockyards was in 1857, and was carried in ordinary [[boxcar]]s retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing the meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, hence proved impractical. During the same period Swift experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars which ran with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to [[New York City]] during the winter months over the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical. [[Detroit]]'s William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. He sold the design in 1868 to [[George Hammond (industrialist)|George H. Hammond]], a Detroit meat-packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the [[Great Lakes]] for cooling.<ref>White, p. 33</ref> The loads had the unfortunate tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and the use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well-insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward.<ref>White, p. 45</ref>\n\nThe meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the [[center of gravity]] low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a practical solution to providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, and allowed Swift & Company to ship their products all over the [[United States]], and internationally. This radically altered the meat business. Swift's attempts to sell this design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in [[Stock car (rail)|stock cars]] and animal pens if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then &mdash; when the [[United States|American]] railroads refused his business &mdash; he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul them into [[Michigan]] and then eastward through [[Canada]]. In 1880, the [[Peninsular Car Company]] (subsequently purchased by [[American Car & Foundry]]) delivered to Swift the first of these units, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year the Line\u2019s roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to Boston. Competing firms such as [[Armour and Company]] quickly followed. By 1920 the SRL owned and operated 7,000 ice-cooled rail cars. The [[General American Transportation Corporation]] assumed ownership of the line in 1930.\n\n<br />\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:One of the first cars out of the Detroit plant of American Car & Foundry - Built 1899 for Swift Refrigerator Line - Chicago Historical Society.jpg|thumb|A builder's photo of one of the first refrigerator cars to come out of the [[Detroit]] plant of the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] (ACF), built in 1899 for the [[Swift Refrigerator Line]].]] -->\n\n'''Live cattle and dressed beef deliveries to New York ([[ton]]s):'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n|\n|align=center | ''(Stock Cars)''\n|align=center | ''(Refrigerator Cars)''\n|-\n|align=center | &nbsp; '''Year &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Live Cattle &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Dressed Beef'''\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1882\n|align=center | 366,487\n|align=center | 2,633\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1883\n|align=center | 392,095\n|align=center | 16,365\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1884\n|align=center | 328,220\n|align=center | 34,956\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1885\n|align=center | 337,820\n|align=center | 53,344\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1886\n|align=center | 280,184\n|align=center | 69,769\n|}\n\n<small>The subject cars travelled on the [[Erie Railroad|Erie]], [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna]], [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]], and [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] railroads.</small>\n\n<small>Source: ''Railway Review'', January 29, 1887, p.&nbsp;62.</small>\n\n==\"Everything but the squeal\"==\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:X-24337.jpg|thumb|This interior view of a [[slaughterhouse]] shows men working with [[pork]] [[carcass]]es and [[viscera]] sometime between 1910 and 1930.]] -->\nIn response to public outcries to reduce the amount of pollutants generated by his packing plants, Swift sought innovative ways to use previously discarded portions of the animals his company butchered. This practice led to the wide scale commercial production of such diverse products as [[oleomargarine]], [[soap]], [[glue]], [[fertilizer]], hairbrushes, buttons, knife handles, and [[pharmaceutical]] preparations such as [[pepsin]] and [[insulin]]. Low-grade meats were canned in products like [[pork and beans]].\n\nThe absence of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] inspection led to abuses. Sausages might incorporate rat droppings, dead rodents, and sawdust, and meat that had spoiled or meat mixed with waste materials was sometimes packed and sold. (Swift once bragged that his slaughterhouses had become so sophisticated that they used \"everything but the squeal.\") Transgressions such as these were first documented in [[Upton Sinclair|Upton Sinclair's]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', the publication of which shocked the nation and led to the passing of the [[Meat Inspection Act|Federal Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906.<ref name=Kutner>Kutner</ref>\n\n==Vertical integration==\n[[Image:Swift Brands South Chicago IL meat packing plant circa 1917.jpg|thumb|A view of the '''Swift Brands''' [[Sioux City, Iowa]] meat packing plant, ''circa'' 1917.

These practices symbolize the concept of \"rationalized organization of work\" to this day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSwift adapted the methods of the industrial revolution to meat packing operations, which resulted in huge efficiency by allowing his plants to produce on a massive scale. The work was divided into myriad specific sub-tasks, which were carried out under the direction of supervisory personnel. Swift & Co. was broken down organizationally into various divisions, each one responsible for conducting a different aspect of the business of \"bringing meat from the ranch to the consumer\". By developing a [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] company, Swift was able to control the sale of his meats from the slaughterhouse to the local butcher shop.<ref>Chandler, p. 70</ref>\n\nSwift devoted a great deal of time to indoctrinating employees and teaching them the company\u2019s methods and policies. He also motivated his employees to focus on the company's profit goals by adhering to a strict policy of promotion from within. The innovations that Swift championed not only revolutionized the meat packing industry, but also played a vital role in establishing the modern American business system, with an emphasis on [[mass production]], functional specialization, managerial expertise, national distribution networks, and adaptation to technological innovation.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n*Boyle, Elizabeth and Rodolfo Estrada.

He was also the power behind the rule of his sons [[John Komnenos Doukas|John]] and [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas|Demetrios]] over Thessalonica in 1237\u20131246.\n\nTheodore was the [[Lineal descendant|scion]] of a distinguished [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]], [[Doukas]], and [[Angelos]] dynasties. Nevertheless, nothing is known about Theodore's life before the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|conquest]] of [[Constantinople]] and dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Following the fall of Constantinople, he served [[Theodore I Laskaris]], founder of the [[Empire of Nicaea]], for a few years before being called to Epirus, where his bastard half-brother [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] had founded an independent principality. When Michael died in 1215, Theodore sidelined his brother's underage and illegitimate son [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]] and assumed the governance of the Epirote state. Theodore continued his brother's policy of territorial expansion. Allied with [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], he expanded into Macedonia, threatening the Latin [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. The capture of the [[Latin Emperor]] [[Peter II of Courtenay]] in 1217 opened the way to the gradual envelopment of Thessalonica, culminating in the city's fall in 1224.\n\nAs ruler of Thessalonica, Theodore quickly declared himself emperor, challenging the Nicaean emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]]'s claims to the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine imperial throne]]. In 1225, he advanced to the outskirts of Constantinople, but his final attack against the seat of the much-reduced Latin Empire was delayed until 1230. In that year, Theodore amassed an army to besiege Constantinople, but then diverted it against [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank. Theodore was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]], and spent the next seven years in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas|Manuel]]. Manuel quickly lost [[Thrace#Medieval history|Thrace]], most of Macedonia, and [[Medieval Albania|Albania]] to the Bulgarian Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|John Asen II]]. Thessalonica itself became a Bulgarian [[vassal state|vassal]], while in Epirus proper power was seized by Michael II, returning from exile.\n\nTheodore was released in 1237 when his daughter [[Irene Komnene Doukaina|Irene]] married John Asen II, and quickly managed to regain control of Thessalonica, ousting Manuel. Having been [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] during his captivity and thus disqualified from occupying the throne again, he installed his eldest son John as emperor, but remained the ''de facto'' regent of the state. Manuel tried to regain Thessalonica with Nicaean support, but a negotiated settlement was reached which gave him Thessaly and left Thessalonica and its environs to Theodore and John. In 1241, John III Vatatzes invited Theodore to visit Nicaea. He was welcomed and treated with great honour, but was effectively detained there until the spring of next year, when Vatatzes marched on Thessalonica with Theodore in tow. Theodore was sent in to negotiate with his son and convince him to accept demotion to the rank of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] and to recognize the [[suzerainty]] of Nicaea. John died in 1244 and was succeeded by Theodore's younger son Demetrios. In 1246, Vatatzes overthrew the unpopular Demetrios and annexed Thessalonica. Theodore influenced his nephew Michael II to launch an attack on Thessalonica in 1251, but in 1252, Vatatzes campaigned against them and forced Michael to come to terms. Theodore was taken prisoner and sent into exile in Nicaea, where he died around 1253.\n\n==Early life and career==\nBorn between 1180 and 1185, Theodore was a son of the ''[[sebastokrator]]'' [[John Doukas (sebastokrator)|John Doukas]] and of Zoe Doukaina.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=548}} His paternal grandparents were [[Constantine Angelos]] and Theodora, a daughter of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081|1118}}). Theodore's uncle, Andronikos, was the father of the emperors [[Isaac II Angelos]] ({{reign|1185|1195|1203|1204}}) and [[Alexios III Angelos]] ({{reign|1195|1203}}), who were Theodore's first cousins.{{sfn|Loenertz|1973|p=362}} As with most members of his family, he preferred to use the surname of \"Doukas\" or \"Komnenos Doukas\" (\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0394\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2); contemporaries variously called him \"Doukas\", \"Komnenos\", or even \"Grand Komnenos\" (\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), an appellation more usually found among the ruling family of the [[Empire of Trebizond]].{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=89 (note 2)}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=548\u2013551 (notes 2, 3)}} Theodore evidently preferred to be associated with the more successful dynasties of the [[Doukai]] and the [[Komnenoi]], rather than the [[Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty|disastrous reign]] of the [[Angeloi]]; indeed the only medieval writers to call him \"Angelos\" were the later, hostile pro-[[Palaiologos]] historians [[Nikephoros Gregoras]] and [[Theodore Skoutariotes]], while [[George Akropolites]] refers to him as \"Komnenos\" until his defeat at Klokotnitsa in 1230 and as \"Angelos\" after.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=89 (note 2)}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|p=3}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=549\u2013551 (notes 3, 4)}}\n\nTheodore's early life is obscure.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=89}} After the [[Fourth Crusade]] [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|captured]] [[Constantinople]] in 1204, he followed [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]] to [[Asia Minor]], where Laskaris founded the [[Empire of Nicaea]]. Theodore's service under Laskaris is relatively unknown except for a brief reference in a letter written by the [[Metropolitan of Corfu]], [[George Bardanes]], one of Theodore's [[apologist]]s. Bardanes writes that Theodore \"took many dangers for his sake and wrested many fortresses from the enemies and subdued them to Laskaris' rule\", distinguishing himself through his valour and receiving many rewards from the Nicaean ruler.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=553\u2013554}} Some modern scholars, such as [[Karl Hopf]] and [[Antoine Bon]], have identified a certain Theodore, who appears as \"lord of [[Argos]]\" and was the successor of [[Leo Sgouros]] in leading the resistance against the Crusaders in the northwestern [[Peloponnese]] after Sgouros' death in 1208, with Theodore Komnenos Doukas. This view has been questioned by [[Raymond-Joseph Loenertz]], who argues that there is no evidence for such an assumption, and that conversely it is well established that Theodore was in Nicaean service at the time.{{sfn|Loenertz|1973|pp=374, 390\u2013391}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=67}}\n\nAround 1210, Theodore was invited by his half-brother [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] to Epirus, where Michael had founded an [[Despotate of Epirus|independent Greek principality]].{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Theodore Komnenos Doukas\" (M. J. Angold), p. 2042}}{{cref|a}} Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers were considered to lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath of allegiance to himself and his heirs.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=553}} Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married [[Maria Petraliphaina]], with whom he had four children.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=90}}\n\n==Ruler of Epirus==\n[[File:Epirus 1205-1230-en.svg|thumb|300px|alt=Map of the Balkans, with the original core of Epirus and its conquered territories shown in various shades of orange|Expansion of the Epirote state during the reigns of Michael I and Theodore Komnenos Doukas]]\nFrom 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas was engaged in territorial expansion, chiefly at the expense of the Latin [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] to his east; after initial reverses, much of [[Thessaly]] was conquered. By 1214, [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]] had been recovered from the Latins as well.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=68}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=682\u2013686}} The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the [[Latin Empire]], but historian [[Filip Van Tricht]] argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire [[#Expansion against the Latin states of Greece|until 1217]].{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=242}} Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=68, 112}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=686}} As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. [[Theodora of Arta]], the boy and his mother spent the duration of Theodore's reign exiled in the Peloponnese.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=552, 553}}\n\n===Relations with Serbia and Nicaea===\nTheodore was capable and extremely ambitious. Notwithstanding his oath to Laskaris, he aspired not only to expand his state at the expense of Thessalonica, but to eventually recover Constantinople and revive the [[Byzantine Empire]] with himself as its ruler.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=553\u2013555}} To secure his northern flank, Theodore allied himself with [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]] and the [[Medieval Albania|Albanian clans]]. The [[Principality of Arbanon]] had already come in the Epirote political orbit under Michael I, and closer ties developed when its ruler, [[Dimitri Progoni|Demetrios]], died in 1215, leaving his principality to his widow, who promptly remarried the next year to a Greek [[magnate]], [[Gregory Kamonas]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=555\u2013556}} Against the Serbs, Theodore abandoned Michael I's attempt to pursue a northward expansion into [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]],{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=112}} and instead pursued an alliance with the Serbian prince [[Stefan II Nemanji\u0107 of Serbia|Stefan II Nemanji\u0107]] ({{reign|1196|1228}}) that was directed towards keeping the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] in check. The ties between Epirus and Serbia were solidified by the marriage of Theodore's brother [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas]] to one of Stefan II's sisters {{circa|1216}}.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=556}} Stefan II then sought to wed one of his sons\u2014in all likelihood his eldest son and heir, [[Stefan Radoslav of Serbia|Stefan Radoslav]]\u2014to Michael I's second daughter Theodora. The [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], [[Demetrios Chomatianos]], refused to sanction the marriage due to [[Prohibited degree of kinship|consanguinity]]\u2014Theodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav's mother, [[Eudokia Angelina]], a daughter of Alexios III Angelos. In 1217, Stefan II tried to circumvent this by suggesting himself as the groom to Theodora's half-sister Maria, but Chomatianos vetoed this proposal as well on similar grounds.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=556}} Finally, Stefan Radoslav married Theodore's firstborn daughter [[Anna Angelina Komnene Doukaina|Anna]] in winter 1219/20.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=569\u2013570}}\n\nWith his position thus strengthened, Theodore expanded his territory into northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], although it is possible that at least part of this region had already been captured by Michael I after the death of the local Bulgarian ruler [[Strez]] in 1214. It is unclear to what extent Theodore's expansion involved direct conflict with the Bulgarian Tsar [[Boril of Bulgaria|Boril]] ({{reign|1207|1218}}), but by 1217 he held [[Ohrid]], [[Prilep]], and most of the plain of [[Pelagonia]], at least up to Strez's old capital at [[Prosek]], and likely beyond, approaching the [[Strymon River]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=113}} As the Greek historian Konstantinos Varzos has noted, the capture of Ohrid, seat of the eponymous archbishopric, was particularly important for the standing of the Epirote state and Theodore's aspirations. Theodore sponsored the election of the distinguished [[canonist]] Chomatianos to the archiepiscopal throne in 1217, and Chomatianos would repay that support with his steadfast championing of Epirote claims to the Byzantine imperial inheritance vis-\u00e0-vis the rival claims of Nicaea.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=557}}\n\n[[File:Stefan the First-Crowned, fresco from Mile\u0161eva.jpg|thumb|left|180px|alt=Slightly damaged painting of a bearded middle-aged man, wearing a golden diadem|13th-century fresco portrait of Stefan II Nemanji\u0107, from the [[Mile\u0161eva monastery]]]]\nFollowing the Fourth Crusade, the Orthodox clergy in the two main Greek states, Epirus and Nicaea, had effectively become separated. In 1208, the Nicaeans had convened a synod and elected [[Michael IV of Constantinople|Michael Autoreianos]] as successor to the vacant see of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The election was uncanonical and therefore of questionable legitimacy. This in turn meant that Laskaris' imperial title was also open to challenge, as he had been crowned by the same Michael Autoreianos.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=114\u2013115}} Already under Michael I, two local synods of bishops had emerged in the Epirote domains to carry on administration of the Church, largely independent of the Patriarch, one at [[Naupaktos]] under [[John Apokaukos]], and one at Ohrid under Chomatianos. The more ambitious Chomatianos soon became the pre-eminent \"western\" bishop, and sought to strengthen the ''de facto'' Epirote autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs, including the appointment of bishops for the local sees without the Patriarch's interference. This policy, which dovetailed with Theodore's own ambitions of independence from and rivalry towards Nicaea, brought the two branches of the Greek Church to an open quarrel, as the Nicaea-based patriarch [[Manuel I Sarantenos]] began appointing bishops of his own to Epirote sees, whom the Epirotes refused to accept.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=115\u2013116}} Despite his close ties to Epirus, Stefan II Nemanji\u0107 exploited the Epirote\u2013Nicaean rivalry to his advantage to secure [[autocephaly]] for the [[Serbian Church]], which traditionally had been under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ohrid. Brushing aside Chomatianos' vehement objections, Stefan managed to have his brother [[Saint Sava|Rastko, renamed Sava]], consecrated by Manuel Sarantenos as autocephalous archbishop of Serbia in 1219.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=569 (esp. note 61)}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=116\u2013119}} Theodore took care not to let the quarrels of the churchmen affect his cordial relations with the Serbian ruler.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=570}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=114}}\n\nTheodore's drive into Macedonia disquieted another local strongman, [[Alexius Slav]], ruler of [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]]. A sworn enemy of Boril, Alexius had been abandoned by his erstwhile ally, the [[Latin Emperor]], [[Henry of Flanders]] ({{reign|1205|1216}}), who in 1213 allied himself with Bulgaria. Facing a possible attack by Theodore as well, Alexius now preferred to make common cause with him, and married a niece of Theodore's wife.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=113\u2013114}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=568\u2013569}}\n\n===Capture of Peter of Courtenay===\nThe Epirote successes in Macedonia worried the Latins, as they opened the way to another attack on Thessalonica. The Kingdom of Thessalonica had been much weakened after the death of its founder, [[Boniface of Montferrat]], in 1207, since which it had been ruled by a regency for his underage son [[Demetrius of Montferrat|Demetrius]] ({{reign|1207|1224}}). Interrupting a campaign against the Nicaeans in Asia Minor, Henry of Flanders hastened to Thessalonica. He took up contact with Boril and was preparing to march against Theodore when he suddenly died on 11 June 1216, probably of [[malaria]], although poisoning by his second wife [[Maria of Bulgaria]] has also been suggested. The death of the warlike Henry, followed by that of [[Pope Innocent III]], the instigator of the Fourth Crusade, a month later, was a major stroke of good fortune for Theodore as it removed two of his most eminent and capable opponents.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=555, 557\u2013558}}\n\n[[File:Peter 2 of Courtenay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Sketch of a medieval seal showing a mounted knight, sword unsheathed, charging towards the right|Seal of Peter of Courtenay]]\nThe barons of the Latin Empire then elected [[Peter II of Courtenay]], a cousin of King [[Philip II Augustus]] of France, as the new Latin Emperor. Receiving news of his election, Peter assembled a small army of 160 knights and 5,500 foot and horse, and set out from France. After being crowned by [[Pope Honorius III]] in [[Rome]], he set sail from [[Brindisi]] in April 1217.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=112}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=558\u2013559}} Peter landed at Dyrrhachium, which he had promised to conquer and return to Venice, while his wife [[Yolanda of Flanders]] sailed on to Constantinople. As in the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion of [[William II of Sicily]] ({{reign|1166|1189}}) in 1185, Peter intended (after capturing Dyrrhachium) to follow the ancient [[Via Egnatia]] to Thessalonica, wresting Albania and Macedonia from Epirote control in the process.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=559\u2013560}}\n\nThe commonly accepted version of events is that Dyrrhachium resisted with success, and as his casualties mounted Peter was forced to raise the siege and start his march towards Thessalonica. The march proved difficult, due to both the harsh terrain and the open hostility of the local population\u2014the Western sources (the ''[[Annales Ceccanenses]]'', [[Richard of San Germano]], [[Philippe Mouskes]], and the continuator of [[Robert of Auxerre]]) also stress the loyalty of the local Albanian population to Theodore.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=560)}} After a few days, Theodore with his army confronted Peter. Theodore requested talks with the papal legate, [[Giovanni Colonna (died 1245)|Giovanni Colonna]], whom he assured of his goodwill and support. Western sources claim that Theodore offered to recognize the primacy of the [[Catholic Church]] and the suzerainty of the Latin Empire\u2014as well as to support Peter in his planned participation in the [[Fifth Crusade]]{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|pp=187, 243}}\u2014and offered the Latins food and guides through the mountains. Peter was glad to receive this unexpected help, and an agreement between the two was concluded. As soon as the Latins let their guard down, Theodore fell upon them. Peter of Courtenay, Colonna, the [[Latin Bishopric of Salona|Latin Bishop of Salona]], Count [[William I of Sancerre]], and many Latin nobles were taken captive, while Peter's army scattered into small roving bands trying to survive.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=560\u2013561}} Akropolites, the chronicler [[Ephraim the Chronicler|Ephraim]], and some Western sources on the other hand claim that Dyrrhachium was captured, and are followed by some modern scholars, including the Greek [[I. D. Romanos]] and the French [[Alain Ducellier]]. According to this view, Theodore offered to acknowledge Peter's suzerainty after the city's fall, only to treacherously ambush and defeat him. As the historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine]] remarks, \"it is not important which version is correct\"; the outcome was the same, and if lost, Dyrrhachium was quickly retaken after Peter's capture.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=560 (note 40)}}\n\nAccording to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's actions were motivated by several factors, which led him to regard Peter as a threat to himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, even if it had failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother [[William VI of Montferrat]] over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica\u2014whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus\u2014strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin [[Principality of Achaea]]. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially in the aftermath of the mission of [[Pelagio Galvani|Cardinal Pelagius]], the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|pp=242\u2013244}}\n\n===Wars with the Latins and the capture of Thessalonica===\nWhatever the true course of events, Theodore's unexpected victory echoed throughout the Greek world, and greatly enhanced his standing; even the usually hostile Akropolites was forced to admit in his history that this feat was \"of great help to the [[Rhomaioi|Romans]]\".{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=561\u2013562}} Conversely it dismayed Pope Honorius, who sent letters to the Latin princes of Greece as well as the [[Doge of Venice]] and Peter of Courtenay's son-in-law King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] ({{reign|1205|1235}}), urging them to engage themselves to secure the release of Peter and Colonna. He even wrote to Andrew and the French bishops to call for a crusade against Theodore, with which he also threatened Theodore in a letter. With the first contingents for the crusade assembling at [[Ancona]] in late 1217, and the Venetians eager to profit from the crusade to recover Dyrrhachium, the pressure bore fruit: in March 1218, Colonna was released, with Theodore offering his apologies and assurances of loyalty to the Pope. Honorius then changed his policy to the point of forbidding the Doge of Venice to harm Theodore in the slightest, hoping thereby to secure the release of more prisoners. Although some of the lesser barons were freed, Peter and many of the most senior lords remained in captivity until their death. It is unknown when Peter of Courtenay died, but this was probably before September 1219.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=562\u2013563}}{{sfn|Nicol|1988|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nThe capture of Peter of Courtenay left both major Latin states in northern Greece, Thessalonica and Constantinople, in the hands of female regents. Before arriving in Constantinople, where she gave birth to Peter's posthumous son, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]] ({{reign|1228|1261}}), Yolanda had stopped at the Peloponnese. There she quickly came to appreciate the wealth and strength of the Principality of Achaea, and arranged the marriage of her daughter Agnes to the principality's heir, [[Geoffrey II of Villehardouin]] ({{reign|{{circa|1229}}|1246}}). A politically astute ruler, Yolanda also secured her eastern border by offering her daughter [[Maria of Courtenay]] in marriage to Theodore Laskaris, who had just been widowed for the second time.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=563\u2013564}}\n\nBefore launching his final stroke against Thessalonica, Theodore also took care to secure his southern flank, by appointing his brother [[Constantine Komnenos Doukas]] as governor in [[Aetolia]] and [[Acarnania]]. An energetic governor, Constantine not only effectively shielded the Epirote domains from the threat of the [[Duchy of Athens]], but soon recovered [[Neopatras]] and [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]] as well.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=565\u2013566}} Theodore himself turned his attention to clearing Thessaly of any remaining Latin presence, culminating in the surrender of the great [[Platamon Castle]] in 1218. Over the next few years, one by one, Theodore captured the fortresses around Thessalonica itself. Platamon controlled the entrance to the [[Thermaic Gulf]], and with the surrender of [[Serres]] in late 1221, Theodore cut the land connection between Constantinople and Thessalonica as well. Thessalonica was left thereby, in the words of John Fine, \"more or less an island in the midst of Theodore's possessions\".{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=114}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=566\u2013568}}\n\nAs the fall of Thessalonica appeared imminent, Pope Honorius [[excommunicate]]d Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the [[Adriatic]] ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] ({{reign|1220|1250}}) soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=571}} In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under [[Robert of Courtenay]] ({{reign|1221|1228}}), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] ({{reign|1222|1254}}).{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=570}} The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count [[Oberto II of Biandrate]], arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the ''de facto'' regent, [[Guy Pallavicini]]. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=571\u2013572}} Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which had come to a standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore coming to terms with the Crusaders.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=572\u2013573}} True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the [[Battle of Poimanenon]]. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=573}}\n\nThis double disaster destroyed the Pope's plans for the crusade, as he had envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army. At the same time, the prospective leader of the crusade, William VI of Montferrat, fell ill. In November, the Pope was forced to postpone the crusade's departure for the next spring.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=573}} With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of the crusade, the exhausted defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=573\u2013574}}{{sfn|Lognon|1950|pp=141\u2013146}} The crusade to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at [[Halmyros]]. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the local water supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and the remnants of the army left Greece. Demetrius of Montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with the help of Frederick II, but died in 1227.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=574\u2013575}}{{sfn|Nicol|1988|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\n==Emperor of Thessalonica==\n{{further|Empire of Thessalonica}}\n[[File:Trachy of Theodore Komnenos Doukas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Obverse and reverse of a silver coin; the former with a standing image of the Virgin Mary, the latter with two standing figures, the left one dressed in regalia and the right one as a warrior saint, handing a castle to the former|[[Billon (alloy)|Billon]] ''[[trachy (currency)|trachy]]'' coin of Theodore as Emperor of Thessalonica]]\nThe capture of Thessalonica, traditionally the second city of the Byzantine Empire after Constantinople, was a major stroke against the Latins and greatly boosted Theodore's standing, so much that he now regarded himself as superior to Vatatzes, and openly claimed the Byzantine imperial title by putting on the purple boots reserved to the emperor.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=573\u2013576}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}} Indeed, one of his major supporters, the eminent [[Metropolitan of Naupaktos]], John Apokaukos, in a letter to the Patriarch in 1222 declared that the Epirotes already regarded Theodore as their \"God-sent regent and emperor\", and later wrote to Theodore's wife expressing the hope that he might be able to assist at their imperial coronation at Thessalonica.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=582}}\n\n===Coronation controversy with Nicaea===\nAccording to Byzantine custom, the coronation of an emperor could only take place in Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and the Patriarch (now [[Germanus II of Constantinople|Germanus II]], 1223\u20131240) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the [[Metropolitan of Thessalonica]], [[Constantine Mesopotamites]], whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=576\u2013578}} In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform the coronation instead.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=578\u2013581}}\n\nAlthough Theodore appears to have assumed, and was addressed by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=581\u2013582}} The French scholar [[Lucien Stiernon]] places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228,{{sfn|Stiernon|1964|pp=197\u2013202}} but the Greek [[Apostolos D. Karpozilos]] rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta.{{sfn|Karpozilos|1973|pp=74\u201375}} [[Eleni Bees-Seferli]] on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227,{{sfn|Bees-Seferli|1971\u201374|pp=272\u2013279}} while [[Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka]] has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.{{sfn|Stavridou-Zafraka|1988|p=44}}\n\nAs befitted a Byzantine emperor, Theodore began setting up a court at his new capital, and dispensed the usual court titles to his relatives and followers. Not much is known about the men that staffed Theodore's regime; most of the available information comes from the writings of Chomatianos. Theodore's brothers Manuel and Constantine were raised to the rank of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]], the long-serving [[John Plytos]] became ''[[panhypersebastos]]'' and ''[[mesazon]]'' (chief minister), and a number of scions of old Byzantine aristocratic families, who had sought refuge in Epirus, were appointed as provincial governors alongside members of the local aristocracy. The title of ''[[dux|doux]]'' was used, but unlike earlier times these were mostly civilian governors with little military authority. Theodore awarded titles with such largesse that formerly exclusive titles such as ''[[sebastos]]'' or ''[[megalodoxotatos]]'' were devalued and came to be held by city notables. His Nicaean rivals, notably Akropolites, mocked him for the haphazard way in which the titles were used and awarded, ignoring the old customs of Constantinople, as if he were \"a Bulgarian or rather a barbarian\".{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=584\u2013589}} To secure his new capital, Theodore instituted a guard of \"[[Tzakones]]\" under a ''[[kastrophylax]]''.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=589}}\n\n[[File:John III Doukas Vatatzes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Head portrait of a middle-aged man with a dark, forked beard, wearing a golden, jewel-encrusted domed crown|John III Doukas Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, from a 15th-century manuscript of the ''Extracts of History'' of [[John Zonaras]]]]\nJohn Vatatzes initially reacted to Theodore's proclamation as emperor by offering to recognize him as a sort of viceroy in his lands, but Theodore rejected this and publicly assumed the full titulature of the Byzantine emperors, as \"''[[basileus]]'' and ''[[autokrator]]'' of the Romans\".{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=583\u2013584}} Theodore's coronation deepened the rift between the western Greeks and Nicaea, which once again was expressed in the ecclesiastic sphere. At first, the Nicaeans tried to limit the blame to Chomatianos: though writing respectfully of Theodore himself, Patriarch Germanus II expressed his indignation at the presumption of Chomatianos in usurping the patriarchal privilege of crowning an emperor, while Chomatianos claimed that, as the successor of the [[Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima|ancient see]] of [[Justiniana Prima]], he was an independent prelate and had the authority to do so.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=579\u2013580, 590\u2013595}}\n\nIn 1227, a synod of Epirote bishops in Arta tried to find a compromise, acknowledging the overall authority of the Patriarch at Nicaea but requesting administrative autonomy, i.e. the right for Theodore to appoint bishops in his domains.  They gave the Patriarch three months to reply, and suggested that if he did not heed their proposals, they might be forced to recognize the supremacy of the Pope instead. Germanus replied by having the patriarchal synod condemn Theodore's assumption of the imperial title. The conflict escalated when Germanus appointed his own candidate to the vacant see of Dyrrhachium. Theodore expelled the bishop, and the Epirote synod instead elected a friend of Chomatianos, [[Constantine Kabasilas]], as the bishop. Germanus now attacked Theodore directly. In response, George Bardanes composed a letter to Germanus, which insisted on Epirote ecclesiastical autonomy and challenged the very legality of Germanus' claims to the patriarchate. The result was a full schism between the Nicaean and Epirote churches that lasted until 1232/33.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=120\u2013121}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=592\u2013600}}\n\n===Expansion into Thrace===\nFollowing Theodore's coronation, there were four rulers who claimed the imperial title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|John Asen II]] ({{reign|1218|1241}}) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=601\u2013603}} Already in 1224, or at least in 1225, Theodore captured [[Chalcidice]] with [[Mount Athos]],{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=122}} and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western [[Thrace]], seizing [[Kavala|Christopolis]], [[Xanthi]], [[Gratini|Gratianopolis]], [[Mosynopolis]] and [[Didymoteicho]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=603}} In an attempt to pre-empt him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had answered the summons of the inhabitants of [[Adrianople]] and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the [[Evros River]] and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the ''[[protostrator]]'' [[John Ises]] and [[John Kammytzes]], was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=603\u2013604}}\n\nThe capture of Adrianople opened the path to Constantinople for Theodore. In order to secure his northern flank, he concluded an alliance with John Asen, sealed by the (second) marriage of his brother Manuel to Maria, an illegitimate daughter of Asen.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=122\u2013123}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=604}} At the same time, the Latins turned to Nicaea and concluded a peace treaty in exchange for further territorial concessions. This pact too was sealed by a marriage, of Theodore Laskaris' daughter Eudokia to the Latin baron [[Anseau de Cayeux]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=604}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=123}} In the same summer of 1225, Theodore led his army to the environs of Constantinople, reaching the towns of [[Bizye]] and [[Vrysis]]. Anseau de Cayeux, leading the Latin army, was heavily wounded in the clashes, but Constantinople itself was not attacked. Not only was Theodore unprepared for a siege against the mighty [[Theodosian Walls]], but news of William of Montferrat's landing at Thessaly forced him to break off operations and return west.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=604\u2013605}}\n\nFor reasons that are unknown, Theodore did not renew his attack on Constantinople in 1226 or the years thereafter.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=123}} Instead, he seems to have occupied himself with domestic affairs, as well as taking care to improve relations with Frederick II during the latter's stop-over at Corfu and [[Cephallonia]] to lead the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228. In 1229, he even sent a company of Greek troops to serve under Frederick in Italy. At the same time, Theodore presided over a rupture in relations with Venice, after his governor in Corfu sequestered the cargo of a shipwrecked Venetian ship. Theodore issued an edict on 19 August 1228 prohibiting Venetian merchants from practising commerce in his realm.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=605\u2013608}} In January of the same year, Robert of Courtenay died, leaving the throne of the Latin Empire to his eleven-year-old brother, Baldwin II. With a regency taking over the governance of the state, the Latin Empire stood further enfeebled. At this moment, John Asen offered an alliance. Baldwin II would marry his daughter Helena, while John Asen would take over the regency and lend his assistance at repelling Theodore's attacks. The Latin barons viewed the offer with mistrust, as it would offer John Asen every opportunity to take over Constantinople himself; instead, they strung out negotiations, and eventually chose the 80-year-old but energetic [[John of Brienne]] ({{reign|1229|1237}}) as regent.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=608\u2013610}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=123\u2013124}} Although the Bulgarian offer failed, it served to open a rift between Theodore and his nominal ally. In a move clearly directed against John Asen, in September 1228, Theodore agreed to a one-year truce with the Latin Empire's regent, [[Narjot de Toucy (died 1241)|Narjot of Toucy]], with the border between the two empires running along a line from [[Aenus (Thrace)|Ainos]] to Vrysis.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=610\u2013611}}{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=385}}\n\n==Klokotnitsa and Bulgarian captivity==\n[[File:Tsar Ivan Asen II cropped.png|thumb|right|200px|alt=Modern painting of a standing man dressed in a green tunic, red cape, holding a sceptre and globus cruciger and wearing a gold-and-red crown|Modern representation of Bulgarian Emperor John Asen II]]\nFinally, in late 1229, Theodore began assembling his forces at Thessalonica\u2014including a contingent of troops sent by Frederick II\u2014for the projected final attack on Constantinople. As his troops marched east in spring 1230, he unexpectedly turned his army north and followed the Evros valley into Bulgaria. Theodore's motives for this sudden change are debated. Contemporary and later historians like Akropolites denounced this as a sign of Theodore's duplicity and treachery. A more likely suggestion is that Theodore, hitherto undefeated in battle, desired to check Bulgarian power and avoid the possibility of the Bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging Constantinople.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=611\u2013612}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=124}} Although caught by surprise, John Asen II reacted rapidly. Allegedly affixing the text of the broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag, he rallied his troops and met Theodore in battle in April 1230. The ensuing [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]] was a crushing victory for the Bulgarian ruler, who took Theodore and many of his officers captive.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=124}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=612\u2013613}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Klokotnitsa, Bulgaria emerged as the mightiest power in the Balkans. Deprived of its energetic ruler, Theodore's empire collapsed: within a few months Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania, fell under Bulgarian rule. As John Asen II boasted in an inscription in the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|Holy Forty Martyrs Church]] at his capital of [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], he \"occupied all the land from Adrianople to Dyrrhachium, Greek, Serbian, and Albanian alike\", although Dyrrhachium itself apparently remained in Greek hands. The Latin [[Duchy of Philippopolis]] was also annexed, and Alexius Slav's principality in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] was extinguished in the process, with Alexius spending the rest of his life at Asen's court.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=124}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=614, 616}}\n\nTheodore's brother Manuel, who managed to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs of the city and his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania recognized his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen II, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to all intents and purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=126}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=616\u2013617, 639\u2013642}} At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently with the support of the local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the ''[[fait accompli]]'' under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=128}} In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=126\u2013128}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=642\u2013652}}\n\nTheodore himself remained in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=617}} Initially he was treated with honour, but at some point during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen II and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] as a result.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=613}} This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Blinding\" (A. Kazhdan), pp. 297\u2013298}} According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=124\u2013125}} Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, [[Irene Komnene Doukaina|Irene]]. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=617}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}\n\n==Return to Thessalonica and final years==\n===Recovery of Thessalonica===\n[[File:Trachy of John Komnenos Doukas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Obverse and reverse of a dark-coloured coin; the former with an image of a four-winged angel, the latter with two standing figures, the left one dressed in regalia and the right one as a warrior saint, holding a sword between them|Billon ''trachy'' of John Komnenos Doukas as Emperor of Thessalonica]]\nAs soon as he was set free, Theodore returned to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son [[John Komnenos Doukas]] ({{reign|1237|1244}}) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=618}} John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=622}}\n\nThe deposed Manuel was sent to exile at [[Attaleia]] in Asia Minor, while his wife Maria was allowed to return to her father. Despite Theodore's actions and the overthrow of his daughter and son-in-law, Akropolites reports that John Asen II remained favourably disposed towards Theodore due to his passionate love for Irene.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=618}} Manuel did not remain quiescent in exile; determined to avenge himself, from Attaleia he secured passage through Turkish lands to Nicaea. There John Vatatzes welcomed him and agreed to support him, but not before he secured from Manuel oaths of loyalty to himself. Thus in early 1239 Manuel with six Nicaean ships set sail for Greece, landing near [[Demetrias]] in Thessaly.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=618\u2013619}} He received widespread support in the province, perhaps even from the local governor, Michael I's son-in-law [[Constantine Maliasenos]], allowing him to raise an army and in a short time occupy [[Farsala]], [[Larissa]], and Platamon. Faced with the option of open civil war, Manuel and Theodore eventually came to terms by dividing the territories of Thessalonica among themselves. Manuel renounced his allegiance to Vatatzes and received Thessaly, John and Theodore kept Thessalonica and the remaining parts of Macedonia as far west as [[Vodena]] and [[Arnissa|Ostrovo]], and Constantine was confirmed in his [[appanage]] of Aetolia and Acarnania.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=619}} To further secure their position, both Theodore and Michael concluded treaties with the powerful Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey II of Villehardouin.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=619}}\n\n===Submission of Thessalonica to Nicaea===\nMichael II in Epirus was not part of the brothers' agreement, and continued to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles. In 1241, when Manuel died, Michael moved quickly to occupy Thessaly.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=620\u2013621}} In June of the same year, John Asen II died, leaving the throne to his seven-year-old son [[Kaliman I of Bulgaria|Kaliman]] ({{reign|1241|1246}}). Coupled with the increasingly deteriorating situation of the Latin Empire, this development left John Vatatzes of Nicaea as the pre-eminent ruler of the region, and the obvious candidate for the capture of Constantinople.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=620\u2013621}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=135}}\n\nBefore undertaking any moves against Constantinople, Vatatzes realized the need to settle affairs with Thessalonica, and in particular with Theodore, whose ambition, capability, and machinations he feared. In 1240 or 1241 he therefore issued an invitation, with assurances of safe-conduct, to Theodore to visit Nicaea. Theodore accepted, and was treated with great honours by Vatatzes, who deferred to him as his \"uncle\" and dined with him at the same table. In reality, Theodore was a prisoner in Nicaea; he was not allowed to leave, and throughout his sojourn in the Nicaean court, preparations were in full swing for a campaign against Thessalonica.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=622}} In spring 1242, Vatatzes crossed over into Europe at the head of his army, with Theodore accompanying him as an honorary prisoner. Facing no resistance, the Nicaean army and fleet arrived before Thessalonica. The city's garrison and inhabitants resisted with success and the Nicaean army, lacking heavy siege equipment, had to settle for a drawn-out blockade. Soon, however, news arrived of a [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f|invasion of Asia Minor]], which forced Vatatzes to break off the campaign and return to Nicaea. Nevertheless, the Nicaean emperor kept this news a secret, and sent Theodore to his son to negotiate. John himself reportedly was willing to surrender the city outright, but his father convinced him to hold out for better terms. In the end, after 40 days of negotiations, John was allowed to keep control of Thessalonica, but renounced his imperial title and accepted Nicaean suzerainty and the title of Despot. Theodore was also allowed to remain at Thessalonica at his son's side.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=622\u2013625}}\n\nJohn ruled as Despot in Thessalonica for two years, until his death in 1244. Theodore himself retired to Vodena, from where he supervised the affairs of state. On John's death he raised his younger son [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas]] ({{reign|1244|1246}}) in his place, and sent an embassy to Nicaea to announce the succession, as befitted the terms of vassalage agreed in 1242.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=625\u2013626}} If John was a religious ascetic, Demetrios was a dissolute youngster who enjoyed partying with his favourites and seducing married women. Although Theodore remained in charge of governance, Demetrios quickly became so unpopular that many leading citizens began viewing direct Nicaean rule with favour.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=626}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=157}}\n\nThings came to a head in autumn 1246, when Kaliman of Bulgaria died, leaving the country in the hands of a regency for his younger brother [[Michael Asen I of Bulgaria|Michael Asen]] ({{reign|1246|1257}}). Vatatzes quickly attacked Bulgaria, and within three months captured most of Thrace and all of eastern and northern Macedonia, while Michael II of Epirus also took advantage of the opportunity to expand into Albania and northwestern Macedonia.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=626\u2013628}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=156\u2013157}} At the close of this campaign in November, as Vatatzes was encamped at Melnik, he was informed of a conspiracy to depose Demetrios and deliver Thessalonica to him in exchange for a [[chrysobull]] guaranteeing the traditional rights and privileges of the city. Vatatzes readily granted this, and sent envoys to Demetrios calling for him to appear in person at his camp. Demetrios, suspicious of Vatatzes' intentions, refused, and the Nicaeans marched on Thessalonica. After a few days, the conspirators opened one of the gates to the Nicaean army, and the city was quickly captured. Demetrios was captured and exiled to [[Lentiana]] in [[Bithynia]], while Thessalonica and all of Macedonia were placed under the governance of the [[Grand Domestic]] [[Andronikos Palaiologos (megas domestikos)|Andronikos Palaiologos]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=157}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=628\u2013630}} Theodore himself, isolated and without power in his refuge at Vodena, apparently remained uninvolved in these events.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=630}}\n\n===Final throw of the dice and death===\nWith Thessalonica secured, Vatatzes turned to Epirus, offering Michael II a marriage alliance between Michael's eldest son [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros]] and his own granddaughter Maria. The offer was enthusiastically accepted by Michael's wife, [[Theodora Petraliphaina]] (a niece of Theodore's own wife), and the young couple were engaged at [[Pegae]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=630\u2013631}} Michael, who had not abandoned his family's ambitions, remained ambivalent about the Nicaean alliance, and Theodore used his influence over his nephew to turn him against it. Thus, in spring 1251, Michael launched a sudden attack on Thessalonica. The city resisted successfully, and in spring of the next year Vatatzes once more crossed into Europe to campaign against the Komnenoi Doukai. Theodore with Michael had turned to the north, capturing Prilep and [[Veles (city)|Veles]], and when they received news of Vatatzes' arrival, they withdrew to Epirus via [[Kastoria]]. Vatatzes besieged and captured Theodore's  stronghold of Vodena, but soon became bogged down in skirmishing in the area of Kastoria. The stalemate was broken when two Epirote generals, [[John Glabas]] and [[Theodore Petraliphas]], defected to the Nicaeans, followed shortly after by the ruler of [[Kruja]], [[Golem of Kruja|Golem]]. This forced Michael to come to terms with Vatatzes, ceding the fortresses he had captured as well as his remaining holdings in Macedonia, and reconfirming the marriage alliance with Nicaea. Furthermore, Vatatzes explicitly demanded the handing over of Theodore. The Epirote ambassadors met Vatatzes at Vodena, where they offered Theodore and the young Nikephoros as hostages. The latter was granted the title of Despot and soon allowed to return to Epirus, but Theodore was moved as a prisoner to Asia Minor.

He was also the power behind the rule of his sons [[John Komnenos Doukas|John]] and [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas|Demetrios]] over Thessalonica in 1237\u20131246.\n\nTheodore was the [[Lineal descendant|scion]] of a distinguished [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]], [[Doukas]], and [[Angelos]] dynasties. Nevertheless, nothing is known about Theodore's life before the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|conquest]] of [[Constantinople]] and dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Following the fall of Constantinople, he served [[Theodore I Laskaris]], founder of the [[Empire of Nicaea]], for a few years before being called to Epirus, where his bastard half-brother [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] had founded an independent principality. When Michael died in 1215, Theodore sidelined his brother's underage and illegitimate son [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]] and assumed the governance of the Epirote state. Theodore continued his brother's policy of territorial expansion. Allied with [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], he expanded into Macedonia, threatening the Latin [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. The capture of the [[Latin Emperor]] [[Peter II of Courtenay]] in 1217 opened the way to the gradual envelopment of Thessalonica, culminating in the city's fall in 1224.\n\nAs ruler of Thessalonica, Theodore quickly declared himself emperor, challenging the Nicaean emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]]'s claims to the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine imperial throne]]. In 1225, he advanced to the outskirts of Constantinople, but his final attack against the seat of the much-reduced Latin Empire was delayed until 1230. In that year, Theodore amassed an army to besiege Constantinople, but then diverted it against [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank. Theodore was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]], and spent the next seven years in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas|Manuel]]. Manuel quickly lost [[Thrace#Medieval history|Thrace]], most of Macedonia, and [[Medieval Albania|Albania]] to the Bulgarian Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|John Asen II]]. Thessalonica itself became a Bulgarian [[vassal state|vassal]], while in Epirus proper power was seized by Michael II, returning from exile.\n\nTheodore was released in 1237 when his daughter [[Irene Komnene Doukaina|Irene]] married John Asen II, and quickly managed to regain control of Thessalonica, ousting Manuel. Having been [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] during his captivity and thus disqualified from occupying the throne again, he installed his eldest son John as emperor, but remained the ''de facto'' regent of the state. Manuel tried to regain Thessalonica with Nicaean support, but a negotiated settlement was reached which gave him Thessaly and left Thessalonica and its environs to Theodore and John. In 1241, John III Vatatzes invited Theodore to visit Nicaea. He was welcomed and treated with great honour, but was effectively detained there until the spring of next year, when Vatatzes marched on Thessalonica with Theodore in tow. Theodore was sent in to negotiate with his son and convince him to accept demotion to the rank of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] and to recognize the [[suzerainty]] of Nicaea. John died in 1244 and was succeeded by Theodore's younger son Demetrios. In 1246, Vatatzes overthrew the unpopular Demetrios and annexed Thessalonica. Theodore influenced his nephew Michael II to launch an attack on Thessalonica in 1251, but in 1252, Vatatzes campaigned against them and forced Michael to come to terms. Theodore was taken prisoner and sent into exile in Nicaea, where he died around 1253.\n\n==Early life and career==\nBorn between 1180 and 1185, Theodore was a son of the ''[[sebastokrator]]'' [[John Doukas (sebastokrator)|John Doukas]] and of Zoe Doukaina.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=548}} His paternal grandparents were [[Constantine Angelos]] and Theodora, a daughter of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081|1118}}). Theodore's uncle, Andronikos, was the father of the emperors [[Isaac II Angelos]] ({{reign|1185|1195|1203|1204}}) and [[Alexios III Angelos]] ({{reign|1195|1203}}), who were Theodore's first cousins.{{sfn|Loenertz|1973|p=362}} As with most members of his family, he preferred to use the surname of \"Doukas\" or \"Komnenos Doukas\" (\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0394\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2); contemporaries variously called him \"Doukas\", \"Komnenos\", or even \"Grand Komnenos\" (\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), an appellation more usually found among the ruling family of the [[Empire of Trebizond]].{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=89 (note 2)}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=548\u2013551 (notes 2, 3)}} Theodore evidently preferred to be associated with the more successful dynasties of the [[Doukai]] and the [[Komnenoi]], rather than the [[Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty|disastrous reign]] of the [[Angeloi]]; indeed the only medieval writers to call him \"Angelos\" were the later, hostile pro-[[Palaiologos]] historians [[Nikephoros Gregoras]] and [[Theodore Skoutariotes]], while [[George Akropolites]] refers to him as \"Komnenos\" until his defeat at Klokotnitsa in 1230 and as \"Angelos\" after.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=89 (note 2)}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|p=3}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=549\u2013551 (notes 3, 4)}}\n\nTheodore's early life is obscure.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=89}} After the [[Fourth Crusade]] [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|captured]] [[Constantinople]] in 1204, he followed [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]] to [[Asia Minor]], where Laskaris founded the [[Empire of Nicaea]]. Theodore's service under Laskaris is relatively unknown except for a brief reference in a letter written by the [[Metropolitan of Corfu]], [[George Bardanes]], one of Theodore's [[apologist]]s. Bardanes writes that Theodore \"took many dangers for his sake and wrested many fortresses from the enemies and subdued them to Laskaris' rule\", distinguishing himself through his valour and receiving many rewards from the Nicaean ruler.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=553\u2013554}} Some modern scholars, such as [[Karl Hopf]] and [[Antoine Bon]], have identified a certain Theodore, who appears as \"lord of [[Argos]]\" and was the successor of [[Leo Sgouros]] in leading the resistance against the Crusaders in the northwestern [[Peloponnese]] after Sgouros' death in 1208, with Theodore Komnenos Doukas. This view has been questioned by [[Raymond-Joseph Loenertz]], who argues that there is no evidence for such an assumption, and that conversely it is well established that Theodore was in Nicaean service at the time.{{sfn|Loenertz|1973|pp=374, 390\u2013391}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=67}}\n\nAround 1210, Theodore was invited by his half-brother [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] to Epirus, where Michael had founded an [[Despotate of Epirus|independent Greek principality]].{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Theodore Komnenos Doukas\" (M. J. Angold), p. 2042}}{{cref|a}} Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers were considered to lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath of allegiance to himself and his heirs.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=553}} Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married [[Maria Petraliphaina]], with whom he had four children.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=90}}\n\n==Ruler of Epirus==\n[[File:Epirus 1205-1230-en.svg|thumb|300px|alt=Map of the Balkans, with the original core of Epirus and its conquered territories shown in various shades of orange|Expansion of the Epirote state during the reigns of Michael I and Theodore Komnenos Doukas]]\nFrom 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas was engaged in territorial expansion, chiefly at the expense of the Latin [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] to his east; after initial reverses, much of [[Thessaly]] was conquered. By 1214, [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]] had been recovered from the Latins as well.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=68}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=682\u2013686}} The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the [[Latin Empire]], but historian [[Filip Van Tricht]] argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire [[#Expansion against the Latin states of Greece|until 1217]].{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=242}} Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=68, 112}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=686}} As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. [[Theodora of Arta]], the boy and his mother spent the duration of Theodore's reign exiled in the Peloponnese.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=552, 553}}\n\n===Relations with Serbia and Nicaea===\nTheodore was capable and extremely ambitious. Notwithstanding his oath to Laskaris, he aspired not only to expand his state at the expense of Thessalonica, but to eventually recover Constantinople and revive the [[Byzantine Empire]] with himself as its ruler.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=553\u2013555}} To secure his northern flank, Theodore allied himself with [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]] and the [[Medieval Albania|Albanian clans]]. The [[Principality of Arbanon]] had already come in the Epirote political orbit under Michael I, and closer ties developed when its ruler, [[Dimitri Progoni|Demetrios]], died in 1215, leaving his principality to his widow, who promptly remarried the next year to a Greek [[magnate]], [[Gregory Kamonas]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=555\u2013556}} Against the Serbs, Theodore abandoned Michael I's attempt to pursue a northward expansion into [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]],{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=112}} and instead pursued an alliance with the Serbian prince [[Stefan II Nemanji\u0107 of Serbia|Stefan II Nemanji\u0107]] ({{reign|1196|1228}}) that was directed towards keeping the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] in check. The ties between Epirus and Serbia were solidified by the marriage of Theodore's brother [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas]] to one of Stefan II's sisters {{circa|1216}}.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=556}} Stefan II then sought to wed one of his sons\u2014in all likelihood his eldest son and heir, [[Stefan Radoslav of Serbia|Stefan Radoslav]]\u2014to Michael I's second daughter Theodora. The [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], [[Demetrios Chomatianos]], refused to sanction the marriage due to [[Prohibited degree of kinship|consanguinity]]\u2014Theodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav's mother, [[Eudokia Angelina]], a daughter of Alexios III Angelos. In 1217, Stefan II tried to circumvent this by suggesting himself as the groom to Theodora's half-sister Maria, but Chomatianos vetoed this proposal as well on similar grounds.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=556}} Finally, Stefan Radoslav married Theodore's firstborn daughter [[Anna Angelina Komnene Doukaina|Anna]] in winter 1219/20.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=569\u2013570}}\n\nWith his position thus strengthened, Theodore expanded his territory into northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], although it is possible that at least part of this region had already been captured by Michael I after the death of the local Bulgarian ruler [[Strez]] in 1214. It is unclear to what extent Theodore's expansion involved direct conflict with the Bulgarian Tsar [[Boril of Bulgaria|Boril]] ({{reign|1207|1218}}), but by 1217 he held [[Ohrid]], [[Prilep]], and most of the plain of [[Pelagonia]], at least up to Strez's old capital at [[Prosek]], and likely beyond, approaching the [[Strymon River]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=113}} As the Greek historian Konstantinos Varzos has noted, the capture of Ohrid, seat of the eponymous archbishopric, was particularly important for the standing of the Epirote state and Theodore's aspirations. Theodore sponsored the election of the distinguished [[canonist]] Chomatianos to the archiepiscopal throne in 1217, and Chomatianos would repay that support with his steadfast championing of Epirote claims to the Byzantine imperial inheritance vis-\u00e0-vis the rival claims of Nicaea.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=557}}\n\n[[File:Stefan the First-Crowned, fresco from Mile\u0161eva.jpg|thumb|left|180px|alt=Slightly damaged painting of a bearded middle-aged man, wearing a golden diadem|13th-century fresco portrait of Stefan II Nemanji\u0107, from the [[Mile\u0161eva monastery]]]]\nFollowing the Fourth Crusade, the Orthodox clergy in the two main Greek states, Epirus and Nicaea, had effectively become separated. In 1208, the Nicaeans had convened a synod and elected [[Michael IV of Constantinople|Michael Autoreianos]] as successor to the vacant see of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The election was uncanonical and therefore of questionable legitimacy. This in turn meant that Laskaris' imperial title was also open to challenge, as he had been crowned by the same Michael Autoreianos.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=114\u2013115}} Already under Michael I, two local synods of bishops had emerged in the Epirote domains to carry on administration of the Church, largely independent of the Patriarch, one at [[Naupaktos]] under [[John Apokaukos]], and one at Ohrid under Chomatianos. The more ambitious Chomatianos soon became the pre-eminent \"western\" bishop, and sought to strengthen the ''de facto'' Epirote autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs, including the appointment of bishops for the local sees without the Patriarch's interference. This policy, which dovetailed with Theodore's own ambitions of independence from and rivalry towards Nicaea, brought the two branches of the Greek Church to an open quarrel, as the Nicaea-based patriarch [[Manuel I Sarantenos]] began appointing bishops of his own to Epirote sees, whom the Epirotes refused to accept.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=115\u2013116}} Despite his close ties to Epirus, Stefan II Nemanji\u0107 exploited the Epirote\u2013Nicaean rivalry to his advantage to secure [[autocephaly]] for the [[Serbian Church]], which traditionally had been under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ohrid. Brushing aside Chomatianos' vehement objections, Stefan managed to have his brother [[Saint Sava|Rastko, renamed Sava]], consecrated by Manuel Sarantenos as autocephalous archbishop of Serbia in 1219.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=569 (esp. note 61)}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=116\u2013119}} Theodore took care not to let the quarrels of the churchmen affect his cordial relations with the Serbian ruler.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=570}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=114}}\n\nTheodore's drive into Macedonia disquieted another local strongman, [[Alexius Slav]], ruler of [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]]. A sworn enemy of Boril, Alexius had been abandoned by his erstwhile ally, the [[Latin Emperor]], [[Henry of Flanders]] ({{reign|1205|1216}}), who in 1213 allied himself with Bulgaria. Facing a possible attack by Theodore as well, Alexius now preferred to make common cause with him, and married a niece of Theodore's wife.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=113\u2013114}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=568\u2013569}}\n\n===Capture of Peter of Courtenay===\nThe Epirote successes in Macedonia worried the Latins, as they opened the way to another attack on Thessalonica. The Kingdom of Thessalonica had been much weakened after the death of its founder, [[Boniface of Montferrat]], in 1207, since which it had been ruled by a regency for his underage son [[Demetrius of Montferrat|Demetrius]] ({{reign|1207|1224}}). Interrupting a campaign against the Nicaeans in Asia Minor, Henry of Flanders hastened to Thessalonica. He took up contact with Boril and was preparing to march against Theodore when he suddenly died on 11 June 1216, probably of [[malaria]], although poisoning by his second wife [[Maria of Bulgaria]] has also been suggested. The death of the warlike Henry, followed by that of [[Pope Innocent III]], the instigator of the Fourth Crusade, a month later, was a major stroke of good fortune for Theodore as it removed two of his most eminent and capable opponents.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=555, 557\u2013558}}\n\n[[File:Peter 2 of Courtenay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Sketch of a medieval seal showing a mounted knight, sword unsheathed, charging towards the right|Seal of Peter of Courtenay]]\nThe barons of the Latin Empire then elected [[Peter II of Courtenay]], a cousin of King [[Philip II Augustus]] of France, as the new Latin Emperor. Receiving news of his election, Peter assembled a small army of 160 knights and 5,500 foot and horse, and set out from France. After being crowned by [[Pope Honorius III]] in [[Rome]], he set sail from [[Brindisi]] in April 1217.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=112}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=558\u2013559}} Peter landed at Dyrrhachium, which he had promised to conquer and return to Venice, while his wife [[Yolanda of Flanders]] sailed on to Constantinople. As in the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion of [[William II of Sicily]] ({{reign|1166|1189}}) in 1185, Peter intended (after capturing Dyrrhachium) to follow the ancient [[Via Egnatia]] to Thessalonica, wresting Albania and Macedonia from Epirote control in the process.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=559\u2013560}}\n\nThe commonly accepted version of events is that Dyrrhachium resisted with success, and as his casualties mounted Peter was forced to raise the siege and start his march towards Thessalonica. The march proved difficult, due to both the harsh terrain and the open hostility of the local population\u2014the Western sources (the ''[[Annales Ceccanenses]]'', [[Richard of San Germano]], [[Philippe Mouskes]], and the continuator of [[Robert of Auxerre]]) also stress the loyalty of the local Albanian population to Theodore.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=560)}} After a few days, Theodore with his army confronted Peter. Theodore requested talks with the papal legate, [[Giovanni Colonna (died 1245)|Giovanni Colonna]], whom he assured of his goodwill and support. Western sources claim that Theodore offered to recognize the primacy of the [[Catholic Church]] and the suzerainty of the Latin Empire\u2014as well as to support Peter in his planned participation in the [[Fifth Crusade]]{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|pp=187, 243}}\u2014and offered the Latins food and guides through the mountains. Peter was glad to receive this unexpected help, and an agreement between the two was concluded. As soon as the Latins let their guard down, Theodore fell upon them. Peter of Courtenay, Colonna, the [[Latin Bishopric of Salona|Latin Bishop of Salona]], Count [[William I of Sancerre]], and many Latin nobles were taken captive, while Peter's army scattered into small roving bands trying to survive.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=560\u2013561}} Akropolites, the chronicler [[Ephraim the Chronicler|Ephraim]], and some Western sources on the other hand claim that Dyrrhachium was captured, and are followed by some modern scholars, including the Greek [[I. D. Romanos]] and the French [[Alain Ducellier]]. According to this view, Theodore offered to acknowledge Peter's suzerainty after the city's fall, only to treacherously ambush and defeat him. As the historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine]] remarks, \"it is not important which version is correct\"; the outcome was the same, and if lost, Dyrrhachium was quickly retaken after Peter's capture.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=560 (note 40)}}\n\nAccording to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's actions were motivated by several factors, which led him to regard Peter as a threat to himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, even if it had failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother [[William VI of Montferrat]] over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica\u2014whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus\u2014strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin [[Principality of Achaea]]. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially in the aftermath of the mission of [[Pelagio Galvani|Cardinal Pelagius]], the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|pp=242\u2013244}}\n\n===Wars with the Latins and the capture of Thessalonica===\nWhatever the true course of events, Theodore's unexpected victory echoed throughout the Greek world, and greatly enhanced his standing; even the usually hostile Akropolites was forced to admit in his history that this feat was \"of great help to the [[Rhomaioi|Romans]]\".{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=561\u2013562}} Conversely it dismayed Pope Honorius, who sent letters to the Latin princes of Greece as well as the [[Doge of Venice]] and Peter of Courtenay's son-in-law King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] ({{reign|1205|1235}}), urging them to engage themselves to secure the release of Peter and Colonna. He even wrote to Andrew and the French bishops to call for a crusade against Theodore, with which he also threatened Theodore in a letter. With the first contingents for the crusade assembling at [[Ancona]] in late 1217, and the Venetians eager to profit from the crusade to recover Dyrrhachium, the pressure bore fruit: in March 1218, Colonna was released, with Theodore offering his apologies and assurances of loyalty to the Pope. Honorius then changed his policy to the point of forbidding the Doge of Venice to harm Theodore in the slightest, hoping thereby to secure the release of more prisoners. Although some of the lesser barons were freed, Peter and many of the most senior lords remained in captivity until their death. It is unknown when Peter of Courtenay died, but this was probably before September 1219.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=562\u2013563}}{{sfn|Nicol|1988|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nThe capture of Peter of Courtenay left both major Latin states in northern Greece, Thessalonica and Constantinople, in the hands of female regents. Before arriving in Constantinople, where she gave birth to Peter's posthumous son, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]] ({{reign|1228|1261}}), Yolanda had stopped at the Peloponnese. There she quickly came to appreciate the wealth and strength of the Principality of Achaea, and arranged the marriage of her daughter Agnes to the principality's heir, [[Geoffrey II of Villehardouin]] ({{reign|{{circa|1229}}|1246}}). A politically astute ruler, Yolanda also secured her eastern border by offering her daughter [[Maria of Courtenay]] in marriage to Theodore Laskaris, who had just been widowed for the second time.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=563\u2013564}}\n\nBefore launching his final stroke against Thessalonica, Theodore also took care to secure his southern flank, by appointing his brother [[Constantine Komnenos Doukas]] as governor in [[Aetolia]] and [[Acarnania]]. An energetic governor, Constantine not only effectively shielded the Epirote domains from the threat of the [[Duchy of Athens]], but soon recovered [[Neopatras]] and [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]] as well.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=565\u2013566}} Theodore himself turned his attention to clearing Thessaly of any remaining Latin presence, culminating in the surrender of the great [[Platamon Castle]] in 1218. Over the next few years, one by one, Theodore captured the fortresses around Thessalonica itself. Platamon controlled the entrance to the [[Thermaic Gulf]], and with the surrender of [[Serres]] in late 1221, Theodore cut the land connection between Constantinople and Thessalonica as well. Thessalonica was left thereby, in the words of John Fine, \"more or less an island in the midst of Theodore's possessions\".{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=114}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=566\u2013568}}\n\nAs the fall of Thessalonica appeared imminent, Pope Honorius [[excommunicate]]d Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the [[Adriatic]] ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] ({{reign|1220|1250}}) soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=571}} In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under [[Robert of Courtenay]] ({{reign|1221|1228}}), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] ({{reign|1222|1254}}).{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=570}} The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count [[Oberto II of Biandrate]], arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the ''de facto'' regent, [[Guy Pallavicini]]. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=571\u2013572}} Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which had come to a standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore coming to terms with the Crusaders.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=572\u2013573}} True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the [[Battle of Poimanenon]]. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=573}}\n\nThis double disaster destroyed the Pope's plans for the crusade, as he had envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army. At the same time, the prospective leader of the crusade, William VI of Montferrat, fell ill. In November, the Pope was forced to postpone the crusade's departure for the next spring.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=573}} With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of the crusade, the exhausted defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=573\u2013574}}{{sfn|Lognon|1950|pp=141\u2013146}} The crusade to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at [[Halmyros]]. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the local water supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and the remnants of the army left Greece. Demetrius of Montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with the help of Frederick II, but died in 1227.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=574\u2013575}}{{sfn|Nicol|1988|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\n==Emperor of Thessalonica==\n{{further|Empire of Thessalonica}}\n[[File:Trachy of Theodore Komnenos Doukas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Obverse and reverse of a silver coin; the former with a standing image of the Virgin Mary, the latter with two standing figures, the left one dressed in regalia and the right one as a warrior saint, handing a castle to the former|[[Billon (alloy)|Billon]] ''[[trachy (currency)|trachy]]'' coin of Theodore as Emperor of Thessalonica]]\nThe capture of Thessalonica, traditionally the second city of the Byzantine Empire after Constantinople, was a major stroke against the Latins and greatly boosted Theodore's standing, so much that he now regarded himself as superior to Vatatzes, and openly claimed the Byzantine imperial title by putting on the purple boots reserved to the emperor.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=573\u2013576}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}} Indeed, one of his major supporters, the eminent [[Metropolitan of Naupaktos]], John Apokaukos, in a letter to the Patriarch in 1222 declared that the Epirotes already regarded Theodore as their \"God-sent regent and emperor\", and later wrote to Theodore's wife expressing the hope that he might be able to assist at their imperial coronation at Thessalonica.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=582}}\n\n===Coronation controversy with Nicaea===\nAccording to Byzantine custom, the coronation of an emperor could only take place in Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and the Patriarch (now [[Germanus II of Constantinople|Germanus II]], 1223\u20131240) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the [[Metropolitan of Thessalonica]], [[Constantine Mesopotamites]], whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=576\u2013578}} In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform the coronation instead.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=578\u2013581}}\n\nAlthough Theodore appears to have assumed, and was addressed by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=581\u2013582}} The French scholar [[Lucien Stiernon]] places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228,{{sfn|Stiernon|1964|pp=197\u2013202}} but the Greek [[Apostolos D. Karpozilos]] rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta.{{sfn|Karpozilos|1973|pp=74\u201375}} [[Eleni Bees-Seferli]] on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227,{{sfn|Bees-Seferli|1971\u201374|pp=272\u2013279}} while [[Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka]] has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.{{sfn|Stavridou-Zafraka|1988|p=44}}\n\nAs befitted a Byzantine emperor, Theodore began setting up a court at his new capital, and dispensed the usual court titles to his relatives and followers. Not much is known about the men that staffed Theodore's regime; most of the available information comes from the writings of Chomatianos. Theodore's brothers Manuel and Constantine were raised to the rank of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]], the long-serving [[John Plytos]] became ''[[panhypersebastos]]'' and ''[[mesazon]]'' (chief minister), and a number of scions of old Byzantine aristocratic families, who had sought refuge in Epirus, were appointed as provincial governors alongside members of the local aristocracy. The title of ''[[dux|doux]]'' was used, but unlike earlier times these were mostly civilian governors with little military authority. Theodore awarded titles with such largesse that formerly exclusive titles such as ''[[sebastos]]'' or ''[[megalodoxotatos]]'' were devalued and came to be held by city notables. His Nicaean rivals, notably Akropolites, mocked him for the haphazard way in which the titles were used and awarded, ignoring the old customs of Constantinople, as if he were \"a Bulgarian or rather a barbarian\".{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=584\u2013589}} To secure his new capital, Theodore instituted a guard of \"[[Tzakones]]\" under a ''[[kastrophylax]]''.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=589}}\n\n[[File:John III Doukas Vatatzes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Head portrait of a middle-aged man with a dark, forked beard, wearing a golden, jewel-encrusted domed crown|John III Doukas Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, from a 15th-century manuscript of the ''Extracts of History'' of [[John Zonaras]]]]\nJohn Vatatzes initially reacted to Theodore's proclamation as emperor by offering to recognize him as a sort of viceroy in his lands, but Theodore rejected this and publicly assumed the full titulature of the Byzantine emperors, as \"''[[basileus]]'' and ''[[autokrator]]'' of the Romans\".{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=583\u2013584}} Theodore's coronation deepened the rift between the western Greeks and Nicaea, which once again was expressed in the ecclesiastic sphere. At first, the Nicaeans tried to limit the blame to Chomatianos: though writing respectfully of Theodore himself, Patriarch Germanus II expressed his indignation at the presumption of Chomatianos in usurping the patriarchal privilege of crowning an emperor, while Chomatianos claimed that, as the successor of the [[Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima|ancient see]] of [[Justiniana Prima]], he was an independent prelate and had the authority to do so.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=120}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=579\u2013580, 590\u2013595}}\n\nIn 1227, a synod of Epirote bishops in Arta tried to find a compromise, acknowledging the overall authority of the Patriarch at Nicaea but requesting administrative autonomy, i.e. the right for Theodore to appoint bishops in his domains.  They gave the Patriarch three months to reply, and suggested that if he did not heed their proposals, they might be forced to recognize the supremacy of the Pope instead. Germanus replied by having the patriarchal synod condemn Theodore's assumption of the imperial title. The conflict escalated when Germanus appointed his own candidate to the vacant see of Dyrrhachium. Theodore expelled the bishop, and the Epirote synod instead elected a friend of Chomatianos, [[Constantine Kabasilas]], as the bishop. Germanus now attacked Theodore directly. In response, George Bardanes composed a letter to Germanus, which insisted on Epirote ecclesiastical autonomy and challenged the very legality of Germanus' claims to the patriarchate. The result was a full schism between the Nicaean and Epirote churches that lasted until 1232/3.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=120\u2013121}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=592\u2013600}}\n\n===Expansion into Thrace===\nFollowing Theodore's coronation, there were four rulers who claimed the imperial title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|John Asen II]] ({{reign|1218|1241}}) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=601\u2013603}} Already in 1224, or at least in 1225, Theodore captured [[Chalcidice]] with [[Mount Athos]],{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=122}} and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western [[Thrace]], seizing [[Kavala|Christopolis]], [[Xanthi]], [[Gratini|Gratianopolis]], [[Mosynopolis]] and [[Didymoteicho]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=603}} In an attempt to pre-empt him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had answered the summons of the inhabitants of [[Adrianople]] and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the [[Evros River]] and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the ''[[protostrator]]'' [[John Ises]] and [[John Kammytzes]], was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=122}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=603\u2013604}}\n\nThe capture of Adrianople opened the path to Constantinople for Theodore. In order to secure his northern flank, he concluded an alliance with John Asen, sealed by the (second) marriage of his brother Manuel to Maria, an illegitimate daughter of Asen.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=122\u2013123}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=604}} At the same time, the Latins turned to Nicaea and concluded a peace treaty in exchange for further territorial concessions. This pact too was sealed by a marriage, of Theodore Laskaris' daughter Eudokia to the Latin baron [[Anseau de Cayeux]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=604}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=123}} In the same summer of 1225, Theodore led his army to the environs of Constantinople, reaching the towns of [[Bizye]] and [[Vrysis]]. Anseau de Cayeux, leading the Latin army, was heavily wounded in the clashes, but Constantinople itself was not attacked. Not only was Theodore unprepared for a siege against the mighty [[Theodosian Walls]], but news of William of Montferrat's landing at Thessaly forced him to break off operations and return west.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=604\u2013605}}\n\nFor reasons that are unknown, Theodore did not renew his attack on Constantinople in 1226 or the years thereafter.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=123}} Instead, he seems to have occupied himself with domestic affairs, as well as taking care to improve relations with Frederick II during the latter's stop-over at Corfu and [[Cephallonia]] to lead the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228. In 1229, he even sent a company of Greek troops to serve under Frederick in Italy. At the same time, Theodore presided over a rupture in relations with Venice, after his governor in Corfu sequestered the cargo of a shipwrecked Venetian ship. Theodore issued an edict on 19 August 1228 prohibiting Venetian merchants from practising commerce in his realm.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=605\u2013608}} In January of the same year, Robert of Courtenay died, leaving the throne of the Latin Empire to his eleven-year-old brother, Baldwin II. With a regency taking over the governance of the state, the Latin Empire stood further enfeebled. At this moment, John Asen offered an alliance. Baldwin II would marry his daughter Helena, while John Asen would take over the regency and lend his assistance at repelling Theodore's attacks. The Latin barons viewed the offer with mistrust, as it would offer John Asen every opportunity to take over Constantinople himself; instead, they strung out negotiations, and eventually chose the 80-year-old but energetic [[John of Brienne]] ({{reign|1229|1237}}) as regent.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=608\u2013610}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=123\u2013124}} Although the Bulgarian offer failed, it served to open a rift between Theodore and his nominal ally. In a move clearly directed against John Asen, in September 1228, Theodore agreed to a one-year truce with the Latin Empire's regent, [[Narjot de Toucy (died 1241)|Narjot of Toucy]], with the border between the two empires running along a line from [[Aenus (Thrace)|Ainos]] to Vrysis.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=610\u2013611}}{{sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=385}}\n\n==Klokotnitsa and Bulgarian captivity==\n[[File:Tsar Ivan Asen II cropped.png|thumb|right|200px|alt=Modern painting of a standing man dressed in a green tunic, red cape, holding a sceptre and globus cruciger and wearing a gold-and-red crown|Modern representation of Bulgarian Emperor John Asen II]]\nFinally, in late 1229, Theodore began assembling his forces at Thessalonica\u2014including a contingent of troops sent by Frederick II\u2014for the projected final attack on Constantinople. As his troops marched east in spring 1230, he unexpectedly turned his army north and followed the Evros valley into Bulgaria. Theodore's motives for this sudden change are debated. Contemporary and later historians like Akropolites denounced this as a sign of Theodore's duplicity and treachery. A more likely suggestion is that Theodore, hitherto undefeated in battle, desired to check Bulgarian power and avoid the possibility of the Bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging Constantinople.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=611\u2013612}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=124}} Although caught by surprise, John Asen II reacted rapidly. Allegedly affixing the text of the broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag, he rallied his troops and met Theodore in battle in April 1230. The ensuing [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]] was a crushing victory for the Bulgarian ruler, who took Theodore and many of his officers captive.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=124}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=612\u2013613}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Klokotnitsa, Bulgaria emerged as the mightiest power in the Balkans. Deprived of its energetic ruler, Theodore's empire collapsed: within a few months Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania, fell under Bulgarian rule. As John Asen II boasted in an inscription in the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|Holy Forty Martyrs Church]] at his capital of [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], he \"occupied all the land from Adrianople to Dyrrhachium, Greek, Serbian, and Albanian alike\", although Dyrrhachium itself apparently remained in Greek hands. The Latin [[Duchy of Philippopolis]] was also annexed, and Alexius Slav's principality in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] was extinguished in the process, with Alexius spending the rest of his life at Asen's court.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=124}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=614, 616}}\n\nTheodore's brother Manuel, who managed to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs of the city and his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania recognized his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen II, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to all intents and purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=126}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=616\u2013617, 639\u2013642}} At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently with the support of the local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the ''[[fait accompli]]'' under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=128}} In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=126\u2013128}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=642\u2013652}}\n\nTheodore himself remained in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=617}} Initially he was treated with honour, but at some point during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen II and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] as a result.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=613}} This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Blinding\" (A. Kazhdan), pp. 297\u2013298}} According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=124\u2013125}} Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, [[Irene Komnene Doukaina|Irene]]. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=617}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}\n\n==Return to Thessalonica and final years==\n===Recovery of Thessalonica===\n[[File:Trachy of John Komnenos Doukas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Obverse and reverse of a dark-coloured coin; the former with an image of a four-winged angel, the latter with two standing figures, the left one dressed in regalia and the right one as a warrior saint, holding a sword between them|Billon ''trachy'' of John Komnenos Doukas as Emperor of Thessalonica]]\nAs soon as he was set free, Theodore returned to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son [[John Komnenos Doukas]] ({{reign|1237|1244}}) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=618}} John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=622}}\n\nThe deposed Manuel was sent to exile at [[Attaleia]] in Asia Minor, while his wife Maria was allowed to return to her father. Despite Theodore's actions and the overthrow of his daughter and son-in-law, Akropolites reports that John Asen II remained favourably disposed towards Theodore due to his passionate love for Irene.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=618}} Manuel did not remain quiescent in exile; determined to avenge himself, from Attaleia he secured passage through Turkish lands to Nicaea. There John Vatatzes welcomed him and agreed to support him, but not before he secured from Manuel oaths of loyalty to himself. Thus in early 1239 Manuel with six Nicaean ships set sail for Greece, landing near [[Demetrias]] in Thessaly.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=618\u2013619}} He received widespread support in the province, perhaps even from the local governor, Michael I's son-in-law [[Constantine Maliasenos]], allowing him to raise an army and in a short time occupy [[Farsala]], [[Larissa]], and Platamon. Faced with the option of open civil war, Manuel and Theodore eventually came to terms by dividing the territories of Thessalonica among themselves. Manuel renounced his allegiance to Vatatzes and received Thessaly, John and Theodore kept Thessalonica and the remaining parts of Macedonia as far west as [[Vodena]] and [[Arnissa|Ostrovo]], and Constantine was confirmed in his [[appanage]] of Aetolia and Acarnania.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=619}} To further secure their position, both Theodore and Michael concluded treaties with the powerful Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey II of Villehardouin.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=619}}\n\n===Submission of Thessalonica to Nicaea===\nMichael II in Epirus was not part of the brothers' agreement, and continued to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles. In 1241, when Manuel died, Michael moved quickly to occupy Thessaly.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=620\u2013621}} In June of the same year, John Asen II died, leaving the throne to his seven-year-old son [[Kaliman I of Bulgaria|Kaliman]] ({{reign|1241|1246}}). Coupled with the increasingly deteriorating situation of the Latin Empire, this development left John Vatatzes of Nicaea as the pre-eminent ruler of the region, and the obvious candidate for the capture of Constantinople.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=620\u2013621}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=135}}\n\nBefore undertaking any moves against Constantinople, Vatatzes realized the need to settle affairs with Thessalonica, and in particular with Theodore, whose ambition, capability, and machinations he feared. In 1240 or 1241 he therefore issued an invitation, with assurances of safe-conduct, to Theodore to visit Nicaea. Theodore accepted, and was treated with great honours by Vatatzes, who deferred to him as his \"uncle\" and dined with him at the same table. In reality, Theodore was a prisoner in Nicaea; he was not allowed to leave, and throughout his sojourn in the Nicaean court, preparations were in full swing for a campaign against Thessalonica.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=622}} In spring 1242, Vatatzes crossed over into Europe at the head of his army, with Theodore accompanying him as an honorary prisoner. Facing no resistance, the Nicaean army and fleet arrived before Thessalonica. The city's garrison and inhabitants resisted with success and the Nicaean army, lacking heavy siege equipment, had to settle for a drawn-out blockade. Soon, however, news arrived of a [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f|invasion of Asia Minor]], which forced Vatatzes to break off the campaign and return to Nicaea. Nevertheless, the Nicaean emperor kept this news a secret, and sent Theodore to his son to negotiate. John himself reportedly was willing to surrender the city outright, but his father convinced him to hold out for better terms. In the end, after 40 days of negotiations, John was allowed to keep control of Thessalonica, but renounced his imperial title and accepted Nicaean suzerainty and the title of Despot. Theodore was also allowed to remain at Thessalonica at his son's side.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=622\u2013625}}\n\nJohn ruled as Despot in Thessalonica for two years, until his death in 1244. Theodore himself retired to Vodena, from where he supervised the affairs of state. On John's death he raised his younger son [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas]] ({{reign|1244|1246}}) in his place, and sent an embassy to Nicaea to announce the succession, as befitted the terms of vassalage agreed in 1242.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=625\u2013626}} If John was a religious ascetic, Demetrios was a dissolute youngster who enjoyed partying with his favourites and seducing married women. Although Theodore remained in charge of governance, Demetrios quickly became so unpopular that many leading citizens began viewing direct Nicaean rule with favour.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=626}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=157}}\n\nThings came to a head in autumn 1246, when Kaliman of Bulgaria died, leaving the country in the hands of a regency for his younger brother [[Michael Asen I of Bulgaria|Michael Asen]] ({{reign|1246|1257}}). Vatatzes quickly attacked Bulgaria, and within three months captured most of Thrace and all of eastern and northern Macedonia, while Michael II of Epirus also took advantage of the opportunity to expand into Albania and northwestern Macedonia.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=626\u2013628}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=156\u2013157}} At the close of this campaign in November, as Vatatzes was encamped at Melnik, he was informed of a conspiracy to depose Demetrios and deliver Thessalonica to him in exchange for a [[chrysobull]] guaranteeing the traditional rights and privileges of the city. Vatatzes readily granted this, and sent envoys to Demetrios calling for him to appear in person at his camp. Demetrios, suspicious of Vatatzes' intentions, refused, and the Nicaeans marched on Thessalonica. After a few days, the conspirators opened one of the gates to the Nicaean army, and the city was quickly captured. Demetrios was captured and exiled to [[Lentiana]] in [[Bithynia]], while Thessalonica and all of Macedonia were placed under the governance of the [[Grand Domestic]] [[Andronikos Palaiologos (megas domestikos)|Andronikos Palaiologos]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=157}}{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=628\u2013630}} Theodore himself, isolated and without power in his refuge at Vodena, apparently remained uninvolved in these events.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=630}}\n\n===Final throw of the dice and death===\nWith Thessalonica secured, Vatatzes turned to Epirus, offering Michael II a marriage alliance between Michael's eldest son [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros]] and his own granddaughter Maria. The offer was enthusiastically accepted by Michael's wife, [[Theodora Petraliphaina]] (a niece of Theodore's own wife), and the young couple were engaged at [[Pegae]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=630\u2013631}} Michael, who had not abandoned his family's ambitions, remained ambivalent about the Nicaean alliance, and Theodore used his influence over his nephew to turn him against it. Thus, in spring 1251, Michael launched a sudden attack on Thessalonica. The city resisted successfully, and in spring of the next year Vatatzes once more crossed into Europe to campaign against the Komnenoi Doukai. Theodore with Michael had turned to the north, capturing Prilep and [[Veles (city)|Veles]], and when they received news of Vatatzes' arrival, they withdrew to Epirus via [[Kastoria]]. Vatatzes besieged and captured Theodore's  stronghold of Vodena, but soon became bogged down in skirmishing in the area of Kastoria. The stalemate was broken when two Epirote generals, [[John Glabas]] and [[Theodore Petraliphas]], defected to the Nicaeans, followed shortly after by the ruler of [[Kruja]], [[Golem of Kruja|Golem]]. This forced Michael to come to terms with Vatatzes, ceding the fortresses he had captured as well as his remaining holdings in Macedonia, and reconfirming the marriage alliance with Nicaea. Furthermore, Vatatzes explicitly demanded the handing over of Theodore. The Epirote ambassadors met Vatatzes at Vodena, where they offered Theodore and the young Nikephoros as hostages. The latter was granted the title of Despot and soon allowed to return to Epirus, but Theodore was moved as a prisoner to Asia Minor. He died shortly after, around 1253.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=631\u2013635}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe modern biographer of the Komnenoi, Konstantinos Varzos, described Theodore as an \"energetic, resourceful, and exceedingly ambitious statesman, who inherited from his ancestor Alexios I Komnenos his endurance and persistence, but not the latter's intelligence, diplomacy, and ability to adapt\". Varzos furthermore points out that despite his great ability, Theodore's ambition to be the one to recover Constantinople and his irreconcilable rivalry with Nicaea actually hampered and delayed the restoration of the Byzantine Empire by several decades.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=636}}\n\nTheodore's legacy left a lasting mark on the political worldview of the western Greeks: Byzantinist [[Donald Nicol]] remarks that \"the memory of Theodore Doukas's victories and of his title to the Byzantine crown lived on in northern Greece and in the hearts of his descendants for many years to come\".{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=20\u201321}} Michael II continued his uncle's rivalry with Nicaea, further delaying the recovery of Constantinople,{{sfn|Nicol|1988|p=171}} and even after the restoration of the Byzantine Empire by Nicaea in 1261, the rulers of Epirus would continue to challenge the revived empire and uphold their own claim to the Byzantine throne.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=16}}\n\n==Family==\nBy his wife Maria Petraliphaina, Theodore had four children:{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=637}}\n# [[Anna Angelina Komnene Doukaina]], who married King [[Stefan Radoslav]] of Serbia\n# [[John Komnenos Doukas]], who became Emperor of Thessalonica in 1237\n# [[Irene Komnene Doukaina]], who married John Asen II\n# [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas]], who succeeded as ruler of Thessalonica in 1244\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{Cnote|a|Although modern historiography frequently calls the Epirote state the \"Despotate of Epirus\", and often applies the title of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] to both Michael I and Theodore, this is anachronistic, as neither of the two bore the title.

This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several [[conjugated double bond]]s, as seen in the structure of [[cinnamic acid]]. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.\n\nThe matrix solution is mixed with the analyte (e.g. [[protein]]-sample). A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both [[hydrophobic]] and water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn analysis of biological systems, Inorganic salts, which are also part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process.

The TOF measurement procedure is also ideally suited to the MALDI ionization process since the pulsed laser takes individual 'shots' rather than working in continuous operation. MALDI-TOF instruments are often equipped with a [[reflectron]] (an \"ion mirror\")  that reflects ions using an electric field. This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution. Modern commercial [[reflectron]] TOF instruments reach a resolving power m/\u0394m of 50,000 FWHM (full-width half-maximum, \u0394m defined as the peak width at 50% of peak height) or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xian|first=Feng|last2=Hendrickson|first2=Christopher L.|last3=Marshall|first3=Alan G.|date=2012-01-17|title=High Resolution Mass Spectrometry|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=84|issue=2|pages=708\u2013719|doi=10.1021/ac203191t|pmid=22263633|issn=0003-2700}}</ref>\n\nMALDI has been coupled with [[Ion-mobility spectrometry\u2013mass spectrometry|IMS]]-TOF MS to identify phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ruotolo |first1=B.

The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of [[sepsis]], and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC.

MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the [[drug resistance]] of bacteria, especially to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|\u03b2-lactams]] (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics. It is predicted that this could serve as a method for identifying a bacterium as drug resistant in as little as three hours. This technique could help physicians decide whether to prescribe more aggressive antibiotics initially.<ref>Hrab\u00e1k, Jaroslav (2015). \"Detection of Carbapenemases Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Meropenem Hydrolysis Assay\".

A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both [[hydrophobic]] and water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized.

This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution.

MALDI/TOF is a diagnostic tool with much potential because it allows for the rapid identification of proteins and changes to proteins without the cost or computing power of [[Next-generation sequencing|sequencing]] nor the skill or time needed to solve a crystal structure in [[X-ray crystallography]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nOne example of this is [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of premature infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of [[sepsis]], and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC. There is hope that a similar technique could be used as a quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.<ref>Sim, K.; Shaw, A. G.; Randell, P.; Cox, M. J.; McClure, Z. E.; Li, M.

MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the [[drug resistance]] of bacteria, especially to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|\u03b2-lactams]] (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics. It is predicted that this could serve as a method for identifying a bacterium as drug resistant in as little as three hours. This technique could help physicians decide whether to prescribe more aggressive antibiotics initially.<ref>Hrab\u00e1k, Jaroslav (2015). \"Detection of Carbapenemases Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Meropenem Hydrolysis Assay\".

It lies entirely in the [[county]] of [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]].  Its western end lies at coordinates {{coord|52|48.1892|N|0|36.5179|W|region:GB|display=inline|format=dms|name=A151 road, western end}} otherwise, {{gbmapping|SK938238}}.<sup id=\"fn_1_back\">[[#fn 1|1]]</sup> This article attempts to deal with its several aspects by treating some separately, before integrating them with the others into an overall picture, sequentially from its western end.\n\n==The British Road Numbering System==\nIn Britain, roads of greater and medium importance are numbered according to a system in which the smaller number of digits indicates a more major route.  The [[motorway]]s are prefixed by M and the principal other roads by the letter A.  The roads [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] to [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] radiate from [[London]] with A1 as the axial route of the country, running between London and [[Edinburgh]]. Roads with numbers beginning with 1 lie to the east of the A1, clockwise when viewed on a map. The details are explained under [[Great Britain road numbering scheme]].\n\n==The A151: Summary==\nIn the early 19th century, the A151 would have been called a cross-road<sup id=\"fn_2_back\">[[#fn 2|2]]</sup> since it runs across the pattern of these radial routes. As originally designated, it ran from the A15 at Bourne Market Place (TF095201), eastwards to Fleet Hargate, three kilometres east of Holbeach (TF393250), on the A17.  Its present western section, between Colsterworth and Bourne, was part of the B676 road.<sup id=\"fn_3_back\">[[#fn 3|3]]</sup>\n\nRoad building and re-thinking of the road system have meant that nowadays, its western end is on the A1 near [[Woolsthorpe by Colsterworth|Colsterworth]], in the administrative district of [[South Kesteven]],<sup id=\"fn_4_back\">[[#fn 4|4]]</sup> and its eastern end on the A17 near [[Holbeach]], in the district of [[South Holland, England|South Holland]].<sup id=\"fn_5_back\">[[#fn 5|5]]</sup> On the way, it passes to the north of [[Grimsthorpe Castle]] and at TF076200, just to the south of [[Bourne Woods|Bourne Wood]]. Then at TF095201, it bisects [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]]. It enters [[The Fens]] on the eastern edge of that small town. At TF154207, it passes through the hamlet of [[Twenty, Lincolnshire|Twenty]], in Bourne North Fen. At [[Guthram Gowt]], it leaves [[Kesteven]] by crossing the [[South Forty-Foot Drain]] into [[Holland, England|Holland]]. The principal town of South Holland is [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] (TF245227), which is also the main town on the A151 route. Across the [[River Welland]], lie [[Moulton, Lincolnshire|Moulton]], then Holbeach, near which the A151 ends at the A17 (TF350258). That road leads on to [[King's Lynn]] and [[East Anglia]].\n\n==Turnpike roads==\nAs elsewhere, roads in England have developed over many years.  Perhaps some of the A151 lies on lines which are pre-Roman. In other words, parts are two thousand or more years old. However, change is constant and little of the road is that old.  In the nature of things, these changes are poorly or not at all documented, so will be treated generally, in that light, in an overview below. The historical part of the story begins with the [[turnpike trust|turnpike roads]].\n\nThe A151 was originally designated such in 1921.  Then, the roads were much as they had been forty or fifty years before, under the turnpike trusts.  Since the [[World War II|Second World War]], there has been much building of by-passes and the like so that the precise lines have sometimes changed but they are still fundamentally the same. The main difference in the present case is that the road designation has been extended from the A15 at Bourne to the A1 at Colsterworth, while at the other end, the easternmost three kilometres have been replaced by a new part of the A17.\n\nIn the field of [[Act of Parliament|acts of Parliament]] founding turnpike trusts, much was happening locally in 1756. The Wansford to [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] trust on the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] had been set up in 1749 but in 1756, its sphere was extended through Stamford to Bourne.  The last 1.6 kilometres of this road, as the trust left it, running down the hill to Bourne Market Place, are now part of the A151. It was freed from tolls on 1 November 1871. The half of this section which lies outside the modern town was probably built by the trust between 1756 and the [[Enclosure Acts|Bourne Enclosure Awards]] of 1770\u20131.<sup id=\"fn_6_back\">[[#fn 6|6]]</sup>\n\nThe Lincoln Heath to [[Peterborough]] Trust was also established in 1756. Its remit included the forerunner of the present A15 which crosses the end of the Stamford road at Bourne Market Place. However, also included with this was the road from the Stamford road west of Bourne (a place known locally as Stamford Hill),<sup id=\"fn_7_back\">[[#fn 7|7]]</sup> to Colsterworth. With the exception of the western extremity, in Colsterworth village, this is now part of the A151. It was freed from tolls on 1 November 1882.\n\nThe Lincoln Heath to Peterborough trust was organized in districts of which that covering the road from Colsterworth to Stamford Hill, Bourne was the \u2018\u2019West District\u2019\u2019.  In 1860, it was re-grouped with the \u2018\u2019Middle District\u2019\u2019 which extended from Graby Bar (TF091295) to [[Market Deeping]] (TF138099).<sup id=\"fn_8_back\">[[#fn 8|8]]</sup>\n\nFrom Spalding, through Holbeach to Long Sutton, beyond the end of the modern A151, the road was turnpiked in 1764.<sup id=\"fn_9_back\">[[#fn 9|9]]</sup> It was freed from tolls on 1 November 1866.  It may not be coincidental that this was the year of the final opening of the [[railway]] from Bourne to King's Lynn, the line having been opened in stages from 1858. This road was declared a main road by the Highways Act of 1878.\n\nThe road from Bourne to Spalding was turnpiked in 1822 and freed from tolls in 1860. It was declared a main road by the Highways Act of 1878. Before 1822, this section was in three parts. One led out from Bourne onto Bourne North Fen. The Spalding end led out from Spalding to the Spalding and Pinchbeck fen edge bank. The linking section was not officially a road. There was however, some [[Drover (Britain)|droving]] traffic which was frowned upon by the drainage authorities, whose embankments it tended to erode. According to Cary's map of 1787, the official route ran ''via'' Tongue End (TF155188) and crossed the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]] at Gurthram (TF173224).\n\n===Toll gates===\nThe principal source of information about the positions of toll gates is the [[Ordnance Survey]] 1 inch map published in 1824.<sup id=\"fn_5a_back\">[[#fn 5a|5a]]</sup> It places them as follows: <!-- frustratingly the online OS maps are all just after the turnpike trusts had wound themselves up -->\n\n* Corby Toll Bar. SK969234 (also 1834-6)\n* T[urn] P[ike]. SK991247\n* T P. TF062210 (also 1834-6)\n* T P. TF079198 (also 1834-6 but there shown as on the Stamford road)\n* Friers Bar.

(also 1834-6 and the O.S. map of 1890 shows \"The Gate\" [[public house]]).<sup id=\"fn_5b_back\">[[#fn 5b|5b]]</sup>\n* T P. TF466217. (also 1834-6)\n\nThe six digit National grid References of the marked positions on the 1824 map are taken from an equivalent modern map. The four digit references <!-- what four digit refs? --> are much less accurate, being taken from an Ordnance Survey map by inspection of Wright Fig.3. The Ordnance Survey does not note the Friars Bar toll gate but in the Exeter Estate book,{{ref|16}} the position is called Friers Bar though no obstruction of the road by a gate is indicated.  ''[[Paterson's Roads]]'' is a road book listing the features of roads and mileages from the ends of its itineraries, sequentially.\n\nIt is noticeable and a little surprising that according to the Ordnance Survey, it was possible in some cases to go a long way out of a town before coming to a toll gate. This is particularly noticeable eastwards from Spalding.\n\n===The Condition of the turnpike roads===\nWe have a few references to the condition of parts of the turnpike forerunners of the A151. Arthur Young's book on the Lincolnshire economy<sup id=\"fn_(50)_back\">[[#fn (50)|(50)]]</sup>  was published in 1813, while the first Fosdyke bridge was still under construction. He therefore, will have taken the future A151 between Spalding and Fleet Hargate on his journey from [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] to [[Wisbech]]. He wrote of it thus: ''In the Hundred of Skirbeck to Boston, and thence to Wisbeach, [turnpike roads] are generally made with [[silt]], or old sea-sand, deposited under various parts of the country ages ago, and when moderately wet are very good; but dreadfully dusty and heavy in dry weather; and also on a thaw they are like mortar. Take the [[county]] in general, and they must be esteemed below par.'' What he is saying is that the turnpike roads in the Townlands were made of the same marine silt as forms the land itself in that part of the country.  The heaviness in dry weather to which he refers, arose from the loose, deep, sandy surface through which wheels would have to be dragged.\nAccording to Wheeler, {{convert|1|LT}} of silt was reckoned to cover {{convert|1|yd}} in a length of a road, {{convert|18|in|mm}} thick and {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, the silt costing about 8d. to 10d. per ton for digging and spreading. In some cases the road was turned over. That is a pit was dug in the road until the silt was reached then that was dug out and formed into the carriageway. The surface of the next length was dug and put into the pit as a foundation then the silt dug and placed on top of it and so on along the road.\nGravel was used where obtainable and from about 1870, Wheeler introduced [[granite]].  By the end of the 20th century granite and [[slag]] were being consolidated by [[steamroller|steam roller]]<ref>Wheeler. pp 441\u2013445.</ref> Of the Bourne to Colsterworth road, Young said ''we were every moment either buried in quagmires of mud or racked to dislocation over pieces of rock which they term mending.'' Materials and methods for repairing fenland roads are described by Wheeler. The best material available was dug locally from pits.\n\n==The Terrain==\nWhen roads are built by engineers with capital to support their work, they are successfully able to build roads across difficult soils.  Modern road builders have less need to seek out easy geological conditions. When roads were made not by [[civil engineers]] but by people walking on the ground, the road followed the [[soils]] which were found to be easiest under foot.\nThe A151 passes across two types of country, the upland and the fen. The highest point on it lies within a kilometre of its western end at 123 metres above [[mean sea level]]. It then passes across a gently sloping dissected plateau of [[Jurassic]] rocks capped in its highest parts by glacial clay. After about 16 kilometres, it enters the fen and is soon at about two metres, rising to three, nearer the coast.\n\n==Description==\n\n===The Western End===\nHaving for some time, extended its influence by diplomacy and trade,<sup id=\"fn_5_back\">[[#fn 5|5]]</sup> The [[Roman Empire]] began to take control in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] from the year 43. An important part of the means of control was the building of soundly-built roads, running directly between key places.<sup id=\"fn_(6)_back\">[[#fn (6)|(6)]]</sup> This led the engineers to overcome all but the greatest obstacles rather than going round them. One result of this was that they built roads on soils which others would have avoided. When the Roman authorities had withdrawn from Britain and their roads wore out, people began to wander from the [[Roman road]] lines where they could find a more secure footing by taking another line.<sup id=\"fn_(7)_back\">[[#fn (7)|(7)]]</sup>\n\nThe Roman equivalent of the A1 was built to a very high standard, during the early years of Roman rule in Britain. The [[English people|English]] successors of the Romans in Britain, called this road [[Ermine Street]] from their word for \"soldier\", compare the [[German language|German]] personal name, Herman.<sup id=\"fn_(8a)_back\">[[#fn (8a)|(8a)]]</sup> The twenty kilometre length of Ermine Street, at roughly the centre of which, the line of the A151 lies, passed over chalky till (boulder clay) which is very sticky when wet. As the Ermine Street carriageway broke up, people sought easier going by moving down towards the small [[River Witham]] whose valley had been eroded through the till, into the [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]] below it.\n\nThus, in 1756 when the Colsterworth to Bourne road was [[Toll road|turnpiked]],<sup id=\"fn_(9a)_back\">[[#fn (9a)|(9a)]]</sup> the toll road which was to become the A151  began at the crossroads in Colsterworth, further west than it now does, though the first toll gate noted by the 1824 Ordnance Survey map was about three kilometres from there. When the Colsterworth bypass was built, its southern half was placed virtually on the Ermine Street line so that now, while the A151 still begins at the A1, it is not at the old Great North Road but at Ermine Street, on the chalky till soil that we start our journey. Bourne Road, Colsterworth, the section removed from the A151, remains part of the B676, the road which leads westwards, towards [[Melton Mowbray]].<sup id=\"fn_(10)_back\">[[#fn (10)|(10)]]</sup>\n\nOnce the clutter associated with a trunk road junction is left behind, the road passes through agricultural land and woods. To the north are fairly level fields and to the south, [[Twyford Wood]], which cloaks the remains of [[RAF North Witham|North Witham airfield]].<sup id=\"fn_(11)_back\">[[#fn (11)|(11)]]</sup>\n\n===Corby Glen===\nAt the end of the wood, we leave Colsterworth parish. Three kilometres from the start, at the hamlet of Birkholme, the road finds a shallow valley formed by erosion which has cut through the till and exposed the underlying Jurassic limestone soils. Here, the 1824 map shows our first toll gate, Corby Toll Bar.<sup id=\"fn_(12)_back\">[[#fn (12)|(12)]]</sup> The road follows this valley, under the railway main line, past the second toll gate site at the junction with the Boothby Pagnel road (B1176), then down to the River Glen at [[Corby Glen]], where it turns a little southwards to avoid more glacial till and keep to the upper [[Lincolnshire limestone]].<sup id=\"fn_(13)_back\">[[#fn (13)|(13)]]</sup>\nThe land between Colsterworth and the western edge of Bourne is a plateau, gently sloping down to the east and much dissected by erosion during periods when it was near but not under ice caps. The River Glen which we crossed at Corby Glen is also called the West Glen and is in one of the two main dissecting valleys.<sup id=\"fn_(140)_back\">[[#fn (14)|(14)]]</sup>\nEast of Corby Glen, we are on a strip of un-dissected plateau. The surface dips very gently towards the east but the [[Stratum|geological strata]] dip more steeply so that a kilometre out of Corby Glen, the road passes onto the strata above the limestone, known as the [[Upper Estuarine Series]], the [[Blisworth Limestone]], [[Blisworth clay]], [[Cornbrash]] and [[Kellaways clay]], in that order.\n\n===Edenham===\nAt Irnham crossroads,<sup id=\"fn_(15)_back\">[[#fn (15)|(15)]]</sup> the A151 leaves Corby Glen parish for that of Edenham and is back down on the cornbrash. To the north, unseen in its little valley beyond the woods is Irnham, once the home of Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, who commissioned the [[Illuminated manuscript|Luttrell Psalter]],<sup id=\"fn_(16)_back\">[[#fn (16)|(16)]]</sup> a book which tells us so much of English everyday life in the 14th century.<sup id=\"fn_17_back\">[[#fn (17)|(17)]]</sup>\n\nThe road dips into the valley of the stream which flows on to form the lake in Grimsthorpe Park.  Just skirting the glacial till, it rises to the crest at the other side, on the Kellaways clay and sand and turns sharply left onto the till.  It used to go straight on and pass the north front of [[Grimsthorpe Castle]].  When the soil in the field beyond the bend is bare, its course can still be seen. The castle's owner did a deal with the turnpike trustees.  He brought land on the other side of the road into his park and built them a new, though longer road around it. Once the semi-circular diversion is completed, the road turns sharp left again, through Grimsthorpe where it is on Jurassic clay.  The 1824 [[Ordnance Survey]] map shows both the old and the new roads.\n\nAt Grimsthorpe village, the A151 is in the second of the main valleys dissecting the plateau, that of the East Glen river. From its association with Edenham, this river is often called the Eden.  The West and East Glens join near Wilsthorpe, at {{gbmapping|TF0913}}.  Through Grimsthorpe and Edenham, there are numerous bends and winds across the small exposures Jurassic soils, glacial gravel and alluvium, until the road climbs out of the valley over the till-capped ridge which separates Edenham parish from Bourne. On the glacial clay soil of the till, it passes between woods, including [[Bourne Woods|Bourne Wood]].<sup id=\"fn_(19)_back\">[[#fn (19)|(19)]]</sup>\n\n===Bourne===\nAs the road arrives back on the Jurassic clay, it meets the [[A6121 road|A6121]], a road designation which ends here, having begun at Morcott, {{gbmapping|SK926004}} in [[Rutland]], on the other side of the A1, hence its beginning with the digit 6. In 1824, there was a toll gate here.<sup id=\"fn_(20)_back\">[[#fn (20)|(20)]]</sup> The course of the A151 is directly down the slope into Bourne. It is clear archaeologically that the road used to run parallel with this and about 200 metres to the south. Historically, there appears to be no commonly available record as to when the move was made.  It was certainly in two stages. The move of the upper part was probably made in the 18th century; the lower, in about 1140, when Bourne castle was built across it. Its present course is dictated by the former presence of Bourne Castle at the town end and by a desire to keep to the crest of a slight ridge in the hillside.<sup id=\"fn_(21)_back\">[[#fn (21)|(21)]]</sup>\n\nIt is towards the top of this section that it is possible to detect a change in slope betraying the former presence of a shore of the [[Devensian]] [[periglacial]] lake, which was impounded by the ice into the Fenland basin. It was more evident but the declivity of the road has been smoothed out a little.<sup id=\"fn_(22)_back\">[[#fn (22)|(22)]]</sup>\n\nMuch more modern, is the bypass road which joins from the south at the entrance to the town and just below the level of the surface of the former lake. This opened for use on 8 October 2005. In the town, the A151 passes immediately outside the castle site, along the latter's northern edge. However the plots along this side of the road were first laid out for houses in around 1280, so that the castle is no longer casually apparent.<sup id=\"fn_(23)_back\">[[#fn (23)|(23)]]</sup>\n\nAt Bourne Market Place, the A151 crosses the A15. This road used to be part of the Lincoln Heath to Peterborough turnpike road, whose act of parliament is dated 1756.  It was this trust which, in 1820, demolished the old town hall which used to stand in the street here.\n\nAt the junction, the road to the north led directly form the main gate of the castle. The market place was positioned immediately across a moat and a [[pomoerium|pom\u0153rium]], outside the gate but those are no longer visible from the road. However, our road continues not straight ahead but on a 45\u00b0 angle toward the south. This bend arose because it passed around the perimeter of the pom\u0153rium until it met the road leading eastwards from the gate. As the A151 reaches this, it turns back through 45\u00b0 and continues eastwards along that approach road, across the line of the Roman version of the A15, [[King Street (Roman road)|King Street]] and past the [[Bourne Abbey|Abbey Lawn]]. This is now a picturesque [[cricket]] ground, but was an 18th-century sheep lawn.<sup id=\"fn_(24)_back\">[[#fn (24)|(24)]]</sup> Soon, the road leaves the 12th century, [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] road, heading towards the pre-Norman town. On arrival, it turns eastwards again, at the same time as crossing the now-buried course of the [[Car Dyke]] and onto the fen-edge gravel.  This is material which drifted down the slope which we have followed, while it was under the water of the Devensian periglacial lake.\n\nThe Car Dyke is generally taken as the boundary of The Fens, though here, it heralds the more commercial part of the town. At once, the road passes the former works of [[British Racing Motors|BRM]], the [[Formula One]] motor racing Constructors' Champion in 1962. The firm is gone but it has left an engineering tradition in the town. Shortly, the road turns north-eastwards, following the bank of the [[Bourne-Morton Canal|Roman artificial river]] across the fen, the Old Ea. At the edge of the town, it turns away from the now hidden river bed, almost eastwards across the black, [[humic]] soil of Bourne North Fen.<sup id=\"fn_(25)_back\">[[#fn (25)|(25)]]</sup> Here we begin to see The Fens as the region more typically is, a broad, nearly flat, agricultural land.\n\nAt {{gbmapping|TF118207}}, the road turns due eastwards at Friar Bar, where to judge by its name, at one stage was a toll bar. The Ordnance Survey does not note it but on the Exeter Estate book,<sup id=\"fn_(26)_back\">[[#fn (26)|(26)]]</sup> it is called Friers Bar.  The road from Bourne to Spalding had been turnpiked in 1822,<sup id=\"fn_(27)_back\">[[#fn (27)|(27)]]</sup> after the survey had begun. So it looks as though the Ordnance Survey had overlooked it. From here, the road runs 3\u00bd kilometres, straight to [[Twenty, Lincolnshire|Twenty]].\n\nThe Car Dyke marked the western boundary of the [[royal forest]] decreed, by one of the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] kings. It extended south and east, across the fens to the Welland. There seems to be no precise agreement as to when the land was disafforested. It was somewhere between 1190 and 1230.<sup id=\"fn_(28)_back\">[[#fn (28)|(28)]]</sup> The obvious occasion was the signing of [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 or perhaps, on one of its re-issues. That document mentions [[John of England|King John's]] afforestations.\n\nRoads on the black soils tend to crumble at the edges as the soft humus collapses and oxidises. This road is typical of fen roads, in needing frequent attention to deal with that. It is typical too, in that it rises and falls as it passes over the silt banks left amongst the peat by small to medium marine creeks from the Middle [[Bronze Age]], 3 to 3\u00bd thousand years ago. This was before the peat in the soil was laid down.\n\nIn the black fens, the buildings are virtually always to be found on these old creeks, known as roddons. The many small roddons in Bourne North Fen merge at Twenty. There, the road uses part of this larger roddon by turning along it towards Guthram. Nowadays, this place is called Guthram Gowt but until the steam drainage engine was erected there, in 184?, it was Guthram Cote.\n\nIn the late medieval period, people lived on the fen edge and the Townlands but the fens themselves were thinly populated. There were however, a few comparatively grand establishments called Halls, Neslam Hall at {{gbmapping|TF1732}}, for example. It was a grange of [[Sempringham Priory]] on the site of the modern Mornington House round which the district boundary is still diverted as it was when the abbey, on the Kesteven fen edge, owned it. There were more but still rather few smaller dwellings called cotes. Moors Cote lay in Bourne North Fen, to the south-east of Twenty and Guthram Cote stood on the boundary between Kesteven and Holland{{ref|18}}, on an island of Devensian deposits, the Abbey sand and gravel. The road book, Paterson's Roads, of 1826, lists a toll gate at Guthram Cote, a distance of {{convert|5+1/4|mi}} from Bourne. Just to the east of this was the bridge over what it calls the [[South Forty-Foot Drain|South Forty-Foot Eau]](15).\n\n===Pinchbeck===\nThe Kesteven-Holland boundary is formed by the [[South Forty-Foot Drain]], the main land drain of the Black Sluice Level. The present layout of the drainage dates from the Act of Parliament of 1765 but this part of the South Forty-foot is a re-use of one of the main drains of the Lindsey Level, a scheme which was declared complete in 1638. On the other side, in Pinchbeck North Fen, the road begins to wind, something quite unusual in these fens. It was laid out on the bank of a [[soak dike]] called the Weir Dike, which was cut in about 1600. In Pinchbeck North Fen, the dike is now largely defunct. The instructions stipulated that it should be at a distance of 100 feet (33M) from the bank of the River Glen. As the river bank meandered a little, so the road does(13).\n\nThe river is the one the A151 crosses at Corby Glen and Edenham. Here the two parts are combined. Beyond the Glen, to the south, is an area of dense [[Romano-British]] occupation. On this side, a little is known but if there is more, it is covered with post-Roman marine silt(14). It looks as though this part of the river began as a single sea bank, keeping the tide out of Pinchbeck South Fen but allowing it into the lower part of that area behind the townland to the north of the road. In the late Roman or early post-Roman period, the Glen escaped from its artificial Roman course of which the Bourne Old Ea was part. (The road follows the bank of this while leaving Bourne) and found its way to these tidal flats. Later, at some early but unknown medieval date, the marsh was turned into a polder of sorts and the Glen was directed along the old sea bank which then became one of the river banks. Thus, the course of the road was determined ultimately, by that of the sea bank.\n\nThe River Glen will have been in the phase when it flowed into the tidal marsh, with its mouth at Guthram, at around 500, the time when the unknown writer who goes under the name of [[Nennius]] tells us that [[King Arthur]] fought his first battle against the English settlers at the mouth of the River Glein.

It lies entirely in the [[county]] of [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]].  Its western end lies at coordinates {{coord|52|48.1892|N|0|36.5179|W|region:GB|display=inline|format=dms|name=A151 road, western end}} otherwise, {{gbmapping|SK938238}}.<sup id=\"fn_1_back\">[[#fn 1|1]]</sup> This article attempts to deal with its several aspects by treating some separately, before integrating them with the others into an overall picture, sequentially from its western end.\n\n==The British Road Numbering System==\nIn Britain, roads of greater and medium importance are numbered according to a system in which the smaller number of digits indicates a more major route.  The [[motorway]]s are prefixed by M and the principal other roads by the letter A.  The roads [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] to [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] radiate from [[London]] with A1 as the axial route of the country, running between London and [[Edinburgh]]. Roads with numbers beginning with 1 lie to the east of the A1, clockwise when viewed on a map. The details are explained under [[Great Britain road numbering scheme]].\n\n==The A151: Summary==\nIn the early 19th century, the A151 would have been called a cross-road<sup id=\"fn_2_back\">[[#fn 2|2]]</sup> since it runs across the pattern of these radial routes. As originally designated, it ran from the A15 at Bourne Market Place (TF095201), eastwards to Fleet Hargate, three kilometres east of Holbeach (TF393250), on the A17.  Its present western section, between Colsterworth and Bourne, was part of the B676 road.<sup id=\"fn_3_back\">[[#fn 3|3]]</sup>\n\nRoad building and re-thinking of the road system have meant that nowadays, its western end is on the A1 near [[Woolsthorpe by Colsterworth|Colsterworth]], in the administrative district of [[South Kesteven]],<sup id=\"fn_4_back\">[[#fn 4|4]]</sup> and its eastern end on the A17 near [[Holbeach]], in the district of [[South Holland, England|South Holland]].<sup id=\"fn_5_back\">[[#fn 5|5]]</sup> On the way, it passes to the north of [[Grimsthorpe Castle]] and at TF076200, just to the south of [[Bourne Woods|Bourne Wood]]. Then at TF095201, it bisects [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]]. It enters [[The Fens]] on the eastern edge of that small town. At TF154207, it passes through the hamlet of [[Twenty, Lincolnshire|Twenty]], in Bourne North Fen. At [[Guthram Gowt]], it leaves [[Kesteven]] by crossing the [[South Forty-Foot Drain]] into [[Holland, England|Holland]]. The principal town of South Holland is [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] (TF245227), which is also the main town on the A151 route. Across the [[River Welland]], lie [[Moulton, Lincolnshire|Moulton]], then Holbeach, near which the A151 ends at the A17 (TF350258). That road leads on to [[King's Lynn]] and [[East Anglia]].\n\n==Turnpike roads==\nAs elsewhere, roads in England have developed over many years.  Perhaps some of the A151 lies on lines which are pre-Roman. In other words, parts are two thousand or more years old. However, change is constant and little of the road is that old.  In the nature of things, these changes are poorly or not at all documented, so will be treated generally, in that light, in an overview below. The historical part of the story begins with the [[turnpike trust|turnpike roads]].\n\nThe A151 was originally designated such in 1921.  Then, the roads were much as they had been forty or fifty years before, under the turnpike trusts.  Since the [[World War II|Second World War]], there has been much building of by-passes and the like so that the precise lines have sometimes changed but they are still fundamentally the same. The main difference in the present case is that the road designation has been extended from the A15 at Bourne to the A1 at Colsterworth, while at the other end, the easternmost three kilometres have been replaced by a new part of the A17.\n\nIn the field of [[Act of Parliament|acts of Parliament]] founding turnpike trusts, much was happening locally in 1756. The Wansford to [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] trust on the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] had been set up in 1749 but in 1756, its sphere was extended through Stamford to Bourne.  The last 1.6 kilometres of this road, as the trust left it, running down the hill to Bourne Market Place, are now part of the A151. It was freed from tolls on 1 November 1871. The half of this section which lies outside the modern town was probably built by the trust between 1756 and the [[Enclosure Acts|Bourne Enclosure Awards]] of 1770-1.<sup id=\"fn_6_back\">[[#fn 6|6]]</sup>\n\nThe Lincoln Heath to [[Peterborough]] Trust was also established in 1756. Its remit included the forerunner of the present A15 which crosses the end of the Stamford road at Bourne Market Place. However, also included with this was the road from the Stamford road west of Bourne (a place known locally as Stamford Hill),<sup id=\"fn_7_back\">[[#fn 7|7]]</sup> to Colsterworth. With the exception of the western extremity, in Colsterworth village, this is now part of the A151. It was freed from tolls on 1 November 1882.\n\nThe Lincoln Heath to Peterborough trust was organized in districts of which that covering the road from Colsterworth to Stamford Hill, Bourne was the \u2018\u2019West District\u2019\u2019.  In 1860, it was re-grouped with the \u2018\u2019Middle District\u2019\u2019 which extended from Graby Bar (TF091295) to [[Market Deeping]] (TF138099).<sup id=\"fn_8_back\">[[#fn 8|8]]</sup>\n\nFrom Spalding, through Holbeach to Long Sutton, beyond the end of the modern A151, the road was turnpiked in 1764.<sup id=\"fn_9_back\">[[#fn 9|9]]</sup> It was freed from tolls on 1 November 1866.  It may not be coincidental that this was the year of the final opening of the [[railway]] from Bourne to King's Lynn, the line having been opened in stages from 1858. This road was declared a main road by the Highways Act of 1878.\n\nThe road from Bourne to Spalding was turnpiked in 1822 and freed from tolls in 1860. It was declared a main road by the Highways Act of 1878. Before 1822, this section was in three parts. One led out from Bourne onto Bourne North Fen. The Spalding end led out from Spalding to the Spalding and Pinchbeck fen edge bank. The linking section was not officially a road. There was however, some [[Drover (Britain)|droving]] traffic which was frowned upon by the drainage authorities, whose embankments it tended to erode. According to Cary's map of 1787, the official route ran ''via'' Tongue End (TF155188) and crossed the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]] at Gurthram (TF173224).\n\n===Toll gates===\nThe principal source of information about the positions of toll gates is the [[Ordnance Survey]] 1 inch map published in 1824.<sup id=\"fn_5a_back\">[[#fn 5a|5a]]</sup> It places them as follows: <!-- frustratingly the online OS maps are all just after the turnpike trusts had wound themselves up -->\n\n* Corby Toll Bar.

(also 1834-6)\n\nThe six digit National grid References of the marked positions on the 1824 map are taken from an equivalent modern map. The four digit references <!-- what four digit refs? --> are much less accurate, being taken from an Ordnance Survey map by inspection of Wright Fig.3. The Ordnance Survey does not note the Friars Bar toll gate but in the Exeter Estate book,{{ref|16}} the position is called Friers Bar though no obstruction of the road by a gate is indicated.  ''[[Paterson's Roads]]'' is a road book listing the features of roads and mileages from the ends of its itineraries, sequentially.\n\nIt is noticeable and a little surprising that according to the Ordnance Survey, it was possible in some cases to go a long way out of a town before coming to a toll gate. This is particularly noticeable eastwards from Spalding.\n\n===The Condition of the turnpike roads===\nWe have a few references to the condition of parts of the turnpike forerunners of the A151. Arthur Young's book on the Lincolnshire economy<sup id=\"fn_(50)_back\">[[#fn (50)|(50)]]</sup>  was published in 1813, while the first Fosdyke bridge was still under construction. He therefore, will have taken the future A151 between Spalding and Fleet Hargate on his journey from [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] to [[Wisbech]]. He wrote of it thus: ''In the Hundred of Skirbeck to Boston, and thence to Wisbeach, [turnpike roads] are generally made with [[silt]], or old sea-sand, deposited under various parts of the country ages ago, and when moderately wet are very good; but dreadfully dusty and heavy in dry weather; and also on a thaw they are like mortar. Take the [[county]] in general, and they must be esteemed below par.'' What he is saying is that the turnpike roads in the Townlands were made of the same marine silt as forms the land itself in that part of the country.  The heaviness in dry weather to which he refers, arose from the loose, deep, sandy surface through which wheels would have to be dragged.\nAccording to Wheeler, {{convert|1|LT}} of silt was reckoned to cover {{convert|1|yd}} in a length of a road, {{convert|18|in|mm}} thick and {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, the silt costing about 8d. to 10d. per ton for digging and spreading. In some cases the road was turned over. That is a pit was dug in the road until the silt was reached then that was dug out and formed into the carriageway. The surface of the next length was dug and put into the pit as a foundation then the silt dug and placed on top of it and so on along the road.\nGravel was used where obtainable and from about 1870, Wheeler introduced [[granite]].  By the end of the 20th century granite and [[slag]] were being consolidated by [[steamroller|steam roller]]<ref>Wheeler. pp 441\u2013445.</ref> Of the Bourne to Colsterworth road, Young said ''we were every moment either buried in quagmires of mud or racked to dislocation over pieces of rock which they term mending.'' Materials and methods for repairing fenland roads are described by Wheeler. The best material available was dug locally from pits.\n\n==The Terrain==\nWhen roads are built by engineers with capital to support their work, they are successfully able to build roads across difficult soils.  Modern road builders have less need to seek out easy geological conditions. When roads were made not by [[civil engineers]] but by people walking on the ground, the road followed the [[soils]] which were found to be easiest under foot.\nThe A151 passes across two types of country, the upland and the fen. The highest point on it lies within a kilometre of its western end at 123 metres above [[mean sea level]]. It then passes across a gently sloping dissected plateau of [[Jurassic]] rocks capped in its highest parts by glacial clay. After about 16 kilometres, it enters the fen and is soon at about two metres, rising to three, nearer the coast.\n\n==Description==\n\n===The Western End===\nHaving for some time, extended its influence by diplomacy and trade,<sup id=\"fn_5_back\">[[#fn 5|5]]</sup> The [[Roman Empire]] began to take control in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] from the year 43. An important part of the means of control was the building of soundly-built roads, running directly between key places.<sup id=\"fn_(6)_back\">[[#fn (6)|(6)]]</sup> This led the engineers to overcome all but the greatest obstacles rather than going round them. One result of this was that they built roads on soils which others would have avoided. When the Roman authorities had withdrawn from Britain and their roads wore out, people began to wander from the [[Roman road]] lines where they could find a more secure footing by taking another line.<sup id=\"fn_(7)_back\">[[#fn (7)|(7)]]</sup>\n\nThe Roman equivalent of the A1 was built to a very high standard, during the early years of Roman rule in Britain. The [[English people|English]] successors of the Romans in Britain, called this road [[Ermine Street]] from their word for \"soldier\", compare the [[German language|German]] personal name, Herman.<sup id=\"fn_(8a)_back\">[[#fn (8a)|(8a)]]</sup> The twenty kilometre length of Ermine Street, at roughly the centre of which, the line of the A151 lies, passed over chalky till (boulder clay) which is very sticky when wet. As the Ermine Street carriageway broke up, people sought easier going by moving down towards the small [[River Witham]] whose valley had been eroded through the till, into the [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]] below it.\n\nThus, in 1756 when the Colsterworth to Bourne road was [[Toll road|turnpiked]],<sup id=\"fn_(9a)_back\">[[#fn (9a)|(9a)]]</sup> the toll road which was to become the A151  began at the crossroads in Colsterworth, further west than it now does, though the first toll gate noted by the 1824 Ordnance Survey map was about three kilometres from there. When the Colsterworth bypass was built, its southern half was placed virtually on the Ermine Street line so that now, while the A151 still begins at the A1, it is not at the old Great North Road but at Ermine Street, on the chalky till soil that we start our journey. Bourne Road, Colsterworth, the section removed from the A151, remains part of the B676, the road which leads westwards, towards [[Melton Mowbray]].<sup id=\"fn_(10)_back\">[[#fn (10)|(10)]]</sup>\n\nOnce the clutter associated with a trunk road junction is left behind, the road passes through agricultural land and woods. To the north are fairly level fields and to the south, [[Twyford Wood]], which cloaks the remains of [[RAF North Witham|North Witham airfield]].<sup id=\"fn_(11)_back\">[[#fn (11)|(11)]]</sup>\n\n===Corby Glen===\nAt the end of the wood, we leave Colsterworth parish. Three kilometres from the start, at the hamlet of Birkholme, the road finds a shallow valley formed by erosion which has cut through the till and exposed the underlying Jurassic limestone soils. Here, the 1824 map shows our first toll gate, Corby Toll Bar.<sup id=\"fn_(12)_back\">[[#fn (12)|(12)]]</sup> The road follows this valley, under the railway main line, past the second toll gate site at the junction with the Boothby Pagnel road (B1176), then down to the River Glen at [[Corby Glen]], where it turns a little southwards to avoid more glacial till and keep to the upper [[Lincolnshire limestone]].<sup id=\"fn_(13)_back\">[[#fn (13)|(13)]]</sup>\nThe land between Colsterworth and the western edge of Bourne is a plateau, gently sloping down to the east and much dissected by erosion during periods when it was near but not under ice caps. The River Glen which we crossed at Corby Glen is also called the West Glen and is in one of the two main dissecting valleys.<sup id=\"fn_(140)_back\">[[#fn (14)|(14)]]</sup>\nEast of Corby Glen, we are on a strip of un-dissected plateau. The surface dips very gently towards the east but the [[Stratum|geological strata]] dip more steeply so that a kilometre out of Corby Glen, the road passes onto the strata above the limestone, known as the [[Upper Estuarine Series]], the [[Blisworth Limestone]], [[Blisworth clay]], [[Cornbrash]] and [[Kellaways clay]], in that order.\n\n===Edenham===\nAt Irnham crossroads,<sup id=\"fn_(15)_back\">[[#fn (15)|(15)]]</sup> the A151 leaves Corby Glen parish for that of Edenham and is back down on the cornbrash. To the north, unseen in its little valley beyond the woods is Irnham, once the home of Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, who commissioned the [[Illuminated manuscript|Luttrell Psalter]],<sup id=\"fn_(16)_back\">[[#fn (16)|(16)]]</sup> a book which tells us so much of English everyday life in the 14th century.<sup id=\"fn_17_back\">[[#fn (17)|(17)]]</sup>\n\nThe road dips into the valley of the stream which flows on to form the lake in Grimsthorpe Park.  Just skirting the glacial till, it rises to the crest at the other side, on the Kellaways clay and sand and turns sharply left onto the till.  It used to go straight on and pass the north front of [[Grimsthorpe Castle]].  When the soil in the field beyond the bend is bare, its course can still be seen. The castle's owner did a deal with the turnpike trustees.  He brought land on the other side of the road into his park and built them a new, though longer road around it. Once the semi-circular diversion is completed, the road turns sharp left again, through Grimsthorpe where it is on Jurassic clay.  The 1824 [[Ordnance Survey]] map shows both the old and the new roads.\n\nAt Grimsthorpe village, the A151 is in the second of the main valleys dissecting the plateau, that of the East Glen river. From its association with Edenham, this river is often called the Eden.  The West and East Glens join near Wilsthorpe, at {{gbmapping|TF0913}}.  Through Grimsthorpe and Edenham, there are numerous bends and winds across the small exposures Jurassic soils, glacial gravel and alluvium, until the road climbs out of the valley over the till-capped ridge which separates Edenham parish from Bourne. On the glacial clay soil of the till, it passes between woods, including [[Bourne Woods|Bourne Wood]].<sup id=\"fn_(19)_back\">[[#fn (19)|(19)]]</sup>\n\n===Bourne===\nAs the road arrives back on the Jurassic clay, it meets the [[A6121 road|A6121]], a road designation which ends here, having begun at Morcott, {{gbmapping|SK926004}} in [[Rutland]], on the other side of the A1, hence its beginning with the digit 6. In 1824, there was a toll gate here.<sup id=\"fn_(20)_back\">[[#fn (20)|(20)]]</sup> The course of the A151 is directly down the slope into Bourne. It is clear archaeologically that the road used to run parallel with this and about 200 metres to the south. Historically, there appears to be no commonly available record as to when the move was made.  It was certainly in two stages. The move of the upper part was probably made in the 18th century; the lower, in about 1140, when Bourne castle was built across it. Its present course is dictated by the former presence of Bourne Castle at the town end and by a desire to keep to the crest of a slight ridge in the hillside.<sup id=\"fn_(21)_back\">[[#fn (21)|(21)]]</sup>\n\nIt is towards the top of this section that it is possible to detect a change in slope betraying the former presence of a shore of the [[Devensian]] [[periglacial]] lake, which was impounded by the ice into the Fenland basin. It was more evident but the declivity of the road has been smoothed out a little.<sup id=\"fn_(22)_back\">[[#fn (22)|(22)]]</sup>\n\nMuch more modern, is the bypass road which joins from the south at the entrance to the town and just below the level of the surface of the former lake. This opened for use on 8 October 2005. In the town, the A151 passes immediately outside the castle site, along the latter's northern edge. However the plots along this side of the road were first laid out for houses in around 1280, so that the castle is no longer casually apparent.<sup id=\"fn_(23)_back\">[[#fn (23)|(23)]]</sup>\n\nAt Bourne Market Place, the A151 crosses the A15. This road used to be part of the Lincoln Heath to Peterborough turnpike road, whose act of parliament is dated 1756.  It was this trust which, in 1820, demolished the old town hall which used to stand in the street here.\n\nAt the junction, the road to the north led directly form the main gate of the castle. The market place was positioned immediately across a moat and a [[pomoerium|pom\u0153rium]], outside the gate but those are no longer visible from the road. However, our road continues not straight ahead but on a 45\u00b0 angle toward the south. This bend arose because it passed around the perimeter of the pom\u0153rium until it met the road leading eastwards from the gate. As the A151 reaches this, it turns back through 45\u00b0 and continues eastwards along that approach road, across the line of the Roman version of the A15, [[King Street (Roman road)|King Street]] and past the [[Bourne Abbey|Abbey Lawn]]. This is now a picturesque [[cricket]] ground, but was an 18th-century sheep lawn.<sup id=\"fn_(24)_back\">[[#fn (24)|(24)]]</sup> Soon, the road leaves the 12th century, [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] road, heading towards the pre-Norman town. On arrival, it turns eastwards again, at the same time as crossing the now-buried course of the [[Car Dyke]] and onto the fen-edge gravel.  This is material which drifted down the slope which we have followed, while it was under the water of the Devensian periglacial lake.\n\nThe Car Dyke is generally taken as the boundary of The Fens, though here, it heralds the more commercial part of the town. At once, the road passes the former works of [[British Racing Motors|BRM]], the [[Formula One]] motor racing Constructors' Champion in 1962. The firm is gone but it has left an engineering tradition in the town. Shortly, the road turns north-eastwards, following the bank of the [[Bourne-Morton Canal|Roman artificial river]] across the fen, the Old Ea. At the edge of the town, it turns away from the now hidden river bed, almost eastwards across the black, [[humic]] soil of Bourne North Fen.<sup id=\"fn_(25)_back\">[[#fn (25)|(25)]]</sup> Here we begin to see The Fens as the region more typically is, a broad, nearly flat, agricultural land.\n\nAt {{gbmapping|TF118207}}, the road turns due eastwards at Friar Bar, where to judge by its name, at one stage was a toll bar. The Ordnance Survey does not note it but on the Exeter Estate book,<sup id=\"fn_(26)_back\">[[#fn (26)|(26)]]</sup> it is called Friers Bar.  The road from Bourne to Spalding had been turnpiked in 1822,<sup id=\"fn_(27)_back\">[[#fn (27)|(27)]]</sup> after the survey had begun. So it looks as though the Ordnance Survey had overlooked it. From here, the road runs 3\u00bd kilometres, straight to [[Twenty, Lincolnshire|Twenty]].\n\nThe Car Dyke marked the western boundary of the [[royal forest]] decreed, by one of the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] kings. It extended south and east, across the fens to the Welland. There seems to be no precise agreement as to when the land was disafforested. It was somewhere between 1190 and 1230.<sup id=\"fn_(28)_back\">[[#fn (28)|(28)]]</sup> The obvious occasion was the signing of [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 or perhaps, on one of its re-issues. That document mentions [[John of England|King John's]] afforestations.\n\nRoads on the black soils tend to crumble at the edges as the soft humus collapses and oxidises. This road is typical of fen roads, in needing frequent attention to deal with that. It is typical too, in that it rises and falls as it passes over the silt banks left amongst the peat by small to medium marine creeks from the Middle [[Bronze Age]], 3 to 3\u00bd thousand years ago. This was before the peat in the soil was laid down.\n\nIn the black fens, the buildings are virtually always to be found on these old creeks, known as roddons. The many small roddons in Bourne North Fen merge at Twenty. There, the road uses part of this larger roddon by turning along it towards Guthram. Nowadays, this place is called Guthram Gowt but until the steam drainage engine was erected there, in 184?, it was Guthram Cote.\n\nIn the late medieval period, people lived on the fen edge and the Townlands but the fens themselves were thinly populated. There were however, a few comparatively grand establishments called Halls, Neslam Hall at {{gbmapping|TF1732}}, for example. It was a grange of [[Sempringham Priory]] on the site of the modern Mornington House round which the district boundary is still diverted as it was when the abbey, on the Kesteven fen edge, owned it. There were more but still rather few smaller dwellings called cotes. Moors Cote lay in Bourne North Fen, to the south-east of Twenty and Guthram Cote stood on the boundary between Kesteven and Holland{{ref|18}}, on an island of Devensian deposits, the Abbey sand and gravel. The road book, Paterson's Roads, of 1826, lists a toll gate at Guthram Cote, a distance of {{convert|5+1/4|mi}} from Bourne. Just to the east of this was the bridge over what it calls the [[South Forty-Foot Drain|South Forty-Foot Eau]](15).\n\n===Pinchbeck===\nThe Kesteven-Holland boundary is formed by the [[South Forty-Foot Drain]], the main land drain of the Black Sluice Level. The present layout of the drainage dates from the Act of Parliament of 1765 but this part of the South Forty-foot is a re-use of one of the main drains of the Lindsey Level, a scheme which was declared complete in 1638. On the other side, in Pinchbeck North Fen, the road begins to wind, something quite unusual in these fens. It was laid out on the bank of a [[soak dike]] called the Weir Dike, which was cut in about 1600. In Pinchbeck North Fen, the dike is now largely defunct. The instructions stipulated that it should be at a distance of 100 feet (33M) from the bank of the River Glen. As the river bank meandered a little, so the road does(13).\n\nThe river is the one the A151 crosses at Corby Glen and Edenham. Here the two parts are combined. Beyond the Glen, to the south, is an area of dense [[Romano-British]] occupation. On this side, a little is known but if there is more, it is covered with post-Roman marine silt(14). It looks as though this part of the river began as a single sea bank, keeping the tide out of Pinchbeck South Fen but allowing it into the lower part of that area behind the townland to the north of the road. In the late Roman or early post-Roman period, the Glen escaped from its artificial Roman course of which the Bourne Old Ea was part. (The road follows the bank of this while leaving Bourne) and found its way to these tidal flats. Later, at some early but unknown medieval date, the marsh was turned into a polder of sorts and the Glen was directed along the old sea bank which then became one of the river banks. Thus, the course of the road was determined ultimately, by that of the sea bank.\n\nThe River Glen will have been in the phase when it flowed into the tidal marsh, with its mouth at Guthram, at around 500, the time when the unknown writer who goes under the name of [[Nennius]] tells us that [[King Arthur]] fought his first battle against the English settlers at the mouth of the River Glein.

Like the other towns, it maintains its own municipal government, but its residents vote in the Jacksonville mayoral election and have representation on the Jacksonville city council.

The hotel was a summer resort with 250 guest rooms. There was also a dance pavilion, tennis courts and a fishing pier.

The author deliberately used spelling which mimicks Arabic pronunciation even if those words have been taken up into mainstream Afrikaans with a different spelling or pronunciation.  It is a literal translation, but the text reads like normal, idiomatic Afrikaans, with a few errors.  The word \"surah\" was translated \"hoofstuk\" (meaning \"chapter\").  The book does not contain the Arabic text.\n* A newer Afrikaans translation of the Qur'an was made using the principles of [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|dynamic equivalence]], but that version is not popular among Afrikaans Muslims.\n\n===Albanian===\n* Ilo Mitke Qaf\u00ebzezi, 1921.\n* Feti Mehdiu, 1985.\n* Hasan Efendi Nahi, 1988.\n* H.

First edition 1961.  The style of Afrikaans dates from the 1940s\u20131960s.  The author deliberately used spelling which mimicks Arabic pronunciation even if those words have been taken up into mainstream Afrikaans with a different spelling or pronunciation.  It is a literal translation, but the text reads like normal, idiomatic Afrikaans, with a few errors.  The word \"surah\" was translated \"hoofstuk\" (meaning \"chapter\").  The book does not contain the Arabic text.\n* A newer Afrikaans translation of the Qur'an was made using the principles of [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|dynamic equivalence]], but that version is not popular among Afrikaans Muslims.\n\n===Albanian===\n* Ilo Mitke Qaf\u00ebzezi, 1921.\n* Feti Mehdiu, 1985.\n* Hasan Efendi Nahi, 1988.\n* H.

Although he was born to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and [[Julia the Elder]], Augustus' only daughter, Gaius and his younger brother, [[Lucius Caesar]], were raised by their grandfather as his adopted sons and joint-heirs to the empire. He would experience an accelerated political career befitting a member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], with the [[Roman Senate]] allowing him to advance his career without first holding a [[Quaestor|questorship]] or [[praetor]]ship, offices that ordinary senators were required to hold as part of the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1 BC, Gaius was given command of the eastern provinces, after which he concluded a [[peace treaty]] with [[Phraates V of Parthia|King Phraates V]] of [[Parthia]] on an island in the [[Euphrates]]. Shortly afterward, he was appointed to the office of consul for the following year, 1 AD. The year after Gaius' consulship, Lucius died at [[Marseille|Massilia]] in the month of August. Approximately eighteen months later, Gaius died of an illness in [[Lycia]]. He was married to his second cousin [[Livilla]] but they did not have children. In 4 AD, following the deaths of Gaius and Lucius, Augustus adopted his stepson, [[Tiberius]], as well as his sole-surviving grandson, [[Agrippa Postumus]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] was an early supporter of Augustus (then \"Octavius\") during the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] that ensued as a result of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC. His father was a key general in Augustus' armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against [[Mark Antony]] and [[Sextus Pompeius]]. From early in the emperor's reign, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who was seemingly on his deathbed in 23 BC, a sign that he would become ''princeps'' were Augustus to die. It is probable that he was to rule until the emperor's nephew, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], came of age. However, Marcellus died of an illness that had spread throughout the city of Rome that year.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunson|2002|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Southern|2013|p=203}}</ref><ref name=Dunston274>{{harvnb|Dunstan|2010|p=274}}</ref>\n\nWith Marcellus gone, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter [[Julia the Elder]], who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given ''[[tribunician power|tribunicia potestas]]'' (\"the tribunician power\") in 18 BC, a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain. The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate, and it was first given to Julius Caesar. Agrippa acted as tribune in the Senate to pass important legislation and, though he lacked some of the emperor's power and authority, he was approaching the position of co-regent.<ref name=Dunston274/><ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|pp=52\u201354}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scullard|2013|p=216}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Augustus Lugdunum principes iuventutis 671253.jpg|thumb|left|Gaius and Lucius Caesar standing with shields and spears between them; ''[[simpulum]]'' and ''[[lituus]]'' above.]]\nGaius was born in [[Rome]] in 20{{nbsp}}BC to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder.

It was here that Phraates, offended by Lollius, disclosed the guardian's secret negotiations to Gaius. It was for the crime of extorting presents from kings (''regnum muneribus'') that Lollius lost the friendship of Gaius and drank poison.

The Romans weren't the only ones interested in Armenia: the Parthians stirred up a revolt among nationalists in the nation. A large force of rebels had occupied the fortress in the city of [[Artagira]]. Gaius was drawn into the conflict, and invaded Armenia in late August of 2 AD. He encountered no serious opposition as there were only a few revolts he had to suppress as a result of the nationalist party.<ref name=Velleius102>Velleius Paterculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#102 II.102]</ref>\n\nOn September 9, Abbadon, the leader of the rebellion, invited Gaius into the fortress to speak with him.

Although he was born to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and [[Julia the Elder]], Augustus' only daughter, Gaius and his younger brother, [[Lucius Caesar]], were raised by their grandfather as his adopted sons and joint-heirs to the empire. He would experience an accelerated political career befitting a member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], with the [[Roman Senate]] allowing him to advance his career without first holding a [[Quaestor|questorship]] or [[praetor]]ship, offices that ordinary senators were required to hold as part of the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1 BC, Gaius was given command of the eastern provinces, after which he concluded a [[peace treaty]] with [[Phraates V of Parthia|King Phraates V]] of [[Parthia]] on an island in the [[Euphrates]]. Shortly afterward, he was appointed to the office of consul for the following year, 1 AD. The year after Gaius' consulship, Lucius died at [[Marseille|Massilia]] in the month of August. Approximately eighteen months later, Gaius died of an illness in [[Lycia]]. He was married to his second cousin [[Livilla]] but they did not have children. In 4 AD, following the deaths of Gaius and Lucius, Augustus adopted his stepson, [[Tiberius]], as well as his sole-surviving grandson, [[Agrippa Postumus]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] was an early supporter of Augustus (then \"Octavius\") during the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] that ensued as a result of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC. His father was a key general in Augustus' armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against [[Mark Antony]] and [[Sextus Pompeius]]. From early in the emperor's reign, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who was seemingly on his deathbed in 23 BC, a sign that he would become ''princeps'' were Augustus to die. It is probable that he was to rule until the emperor's nephew, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], came of age. However, Marcellus died of an illness that had spread throughout the city of Rome that year.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunson|2002|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Southern|2013|p=203}}</ref><ref name=Dunston274>{{harvnb|Dunstan|2010|p=274}}</ref>\n\nWith Marcellus gone, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter [[Julia the Elder]], who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given ''[[tribunician power|tribunicia potestas]]'' (\"the tribunician power\") in 18 BC, a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain. The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate, and it was first given to Julius Caesar. Agrippa acted as tribune in the Senate to pass important legislation and, though he lacked some of the emperor's power and authority, he was approaching the position of co-regent.<ref name=Dunston274/><ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|pp=52\u201354}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scullard|2013|p=216}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Augustus Lugdunum principes iuventutis 671253.jpg|thumb|left|Gaius and Lucius Caesar standing with shields and spears between them; ''[[simpulum]]'' and ''[[lituus]]'' above.]]\nGaius was born in [[Rome]] in 20{{nbsp}}BC to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. He was a part of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], and was related to all the Julio-Claudian emperors. On his mother's side, he was the oldest grandson of emperor [[Augustus]]. He was the stepson of [[Tiberius]] by his mother Julia\u2019s marriage to him, and Brother in law of [[Claudius]] by his sister [[Agrippina the Elder]]'s marriage to [[Germanicus]]. He also was the uncle of [[Caligula]], who was the son of his sister Agrippina.

The ''[[aurei]]'' and ''[[denarius|denarii]]'' issued in 13\u201312{{nbsp}}BC made clear the Emperor's dynastic plans for Gaius and Lucius. Their father was no longer available to assume the reins of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1999|p=65}}</ref>\n\nTo learn about military affairs, he accompanied Tiberius in his campaign against the [[Sicambri]] in 8{{nbsp}}BC.<ref name=Smith555/> The year before, Tiberius' brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus the Elder]] died on his way back from a campaign across the [[Rhine]]. Tiberius was given command of Germania, and waged two campaigns across the Rhine in 8{{nbsp}}BC and 7{{nbsp}}BC. He marched his army between the [[Elbe]] and the Rhine, and met little resistance, except from the Sicambri. Tiberius came close to exterminating the Sicambri, and had those who survived transported to the Roman side of the Rhine, where they could be watched more closely.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|p=157}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:Gaius Caesar (20 v.

The council decided to ratify the will brought by Archelaus, which included a large bequest to Augustus and his wife [[Livia]].<ref>Josephus, ''[http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-17.htm Antiquities of the Jews]'', XVII.9.5</ref><ref name=Ferrero257>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|p=257}}</ref>\n\nThe cities of Judaea rose in revolt after the ''procurator'', Sabinus, garrisoned [[Syria Palaestina]] to guard the tens of millions of [[sesterces]] promised to the Emperor.<ref>Josephus, ''[http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-17.htm Antiquities of the Jews]'', XVII.10.2\u201310</ref> The governor of Syria, [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]], was forced to bring in the legions from Syria to restore order.<ref name=Ferrero257/>\n\nAt the same time, [[Phraates IV|King Phraates IV]] of [[Parthia]] had seized Armenia with the help of Armenian nationalists, and expelled [[Tigranes IV]], the king installed by Rome.<ref>Velleius Paterculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#100 II.100]</ref> Historian [[Guglielmo Ferrero|Ferrero]] speculates that Phraates may have been hoping to use Armenia as a bargaining chip to secure the release of his sons who were held captive by the Romans.

Before Rome could deal with the Parthians in Armenia, it would first need to make its Syrian legions available, which were still tied down in Palestine.<ref name=Ferrero259>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|p=259}}</ref>\n\nIn order to free up the legions there, the Kingdom of Judaea was divided among the sons of Herod the Great. One half remained under Archelaus, while the other half was subdivided between his brothers, Antipas and [[Herod II|Philip]]. This served to restore stability to the region, whilst keeping Judaea from becoming powerful. Having settled matters in Judaea, the Emperor decided to deploy an army to Armenia to re-establish its status as a Roman protectorate and to show the eastern world that Rome held dominion over all land as far as the [[Euphrates]].<ref name=Ferrero259/>\n\n===Command in Asia===\n====Departure====\n[[File:RomaForoAugusto.JPG|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Forum of Augustus]] with the Temple of Mars Ultor.]]\nDue to his advanced age, Augustus was unable to travel to the east himself. There were few the Emperor trusted to settle matters in the east, but he was confident Gaius could. Gaius made a good choice, because his presence represented that of the imperial family \u2013 all orders, promises, or threats coming from him were as valid as if they came from the Emperor himself. Nonetheless, he was only eighteen, and therefore too young for the conduct of important business.<ref name=Ferrero259-261>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|pp=259\u2013261}}</ref>\n\nBefore leaving for the east, he and his brother Lucius were given the authority to consecrate buildings, and they did, with their management of the games held to celebrate the dedication of the [[Temple of Mars Ultor]] (1 August 2{{nbsp}}BC). His youngest brother, Postumus, participated in the Trojan game with the rest of the equestrian youth. 260 lions were slaughtered in the [[Circus Maximus]], there was gladiatorial combat, a naval battle between the \"Persians\" and the \"Athenians\", and 36 crocodiles were slaughtered in the [[Circus Flaminius]].<ref group=note>Cassius Dio reports that, after the games, Gaius was given command of the legions on the Ister ([[Danube]]), and that he did not take part in actions as he was there to learn (Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#10 LV.10]).</ref><ref name=Dio10>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#10 LV.10]</ref>\n\nFriends of Augustus had hoped that he would abandon his plan of sending Gaius to the east but, faced with the troubles in the east, he persisted with the plan and dispatched Gaius to Syria at the beginning of 1{{nbsp}}BC.

From every corner the young consul was visited by envoys offering requests and paying homage. This year, monuments were raised to him and to his brother as the son of [[Ares]] or as Ares himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|p=276}}</ref>\n\nHis inexperience meant he was forced to rely on his companions, namely the unruly Lollius, who had taken advantage of the powers he held, and was reportedly holding towns, individuals, and even sovereign princes for ransom. After Gaius opened negotiations with Phraates, Lollius offered the Parthian king certain concessions in return for money.<ref name=Ferrero276-7>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|pp=276\u2013277}}</ref>\n\nPreparations for the war continued into the spring and summer of 1{{nbsp}}AD, at which point there had been a successful breakthrough in negotiations. As Phraates was not willing to go to war, he agreed to evacuate Armenia and abandon his brothers who were still in Roman captivity.<ref name=Dio10/><ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|pp=277\u2013278}}</ref> In the second half of the year,<ref>{{CIL|11|1421}}</ref> Gaius had advanced with his army to the Parthian frontier to an unknown spot and brought Phraates to a final agreement on the proposals, in which he renounced all claims to Armenia and all power over his half-brothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|p=284}}</ref>\n\nIt was about this time that Augustus passed through Judea and commended Gaius for not offering prayers at Jerusalem, as it would have been provocative to the Jews living there.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augustus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/Augustus*.html#93 93]</ref>\n\n====Expedition in Arabia====\nSometime in the course of his time in the east, Gaius led an expedition into Arabia. Exactly where and for what purpose remains uncertain, though [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentioned it in connection with [[Aelius Gallus]]' exploits in [[South Arabia]].<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D32 VI.32]</ref> The term \"Arabia\" is never defined, and the term was used loosely by Roman sources. Various reasons, such as an attempt by Rome to control the incense trade, have been suggested but never proven.<ref>{{harvnb|Young|2001|pp=91\u201393}}</ref> Juba II, former king of [[Mauretania]], accompanied Gaius to the east. In order to prepare Gaius for his encounter with the Arabs, Juba wrote him a treatise. According to Pliny, the young prince made it as far as the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. It is certain that this expedition happened before his time in Armenia, and, referencing Gaius' cenotaph in Pisa, it is almost certain to have taken place during his consulship.<ref name=Bowersock56/>\n\nAuthor and historian [[John Grainger]] places Gaius at the Gulf of Aqaba, or in [[Nabataea]]. It is known that the [[Nabataean Kingdom]] later became the province of [[Roman Arabia|Arabia]], and so, it might be that Gaius conducted his \"Arabian expedition\" to either support or to discipline the King of Nabataea, [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]].<ref name=Grainger117>{{harvnb|Grainger|2013|p=117}}</ref> This is probably evidenced by the continuation of coinage in the king's name after Gaius' consulship.<ref name=Bowersock56/>\n\n[[Cassius Dio]], in a fragmentary notice,<ref name=\"LV.10a\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#10a LV.10a]</ref> mentions trouble in Egypt which was suppressed by a tribune of the Praetorian Guard. It is very likely this man was part of Gaius' entourage, but other than that nothing is known of him.<ref name=Grainger117/>\n\n====Supremacy in Armenia====\n[[File:Roman East 50-en.svg|thumb|left|Map of Armenia and the Roman client states in eastern Asia Minor.]]\nIn the year following his consulship, in spring, he had held a meeting with Phraates on the bank of the Euphrates, in which a banquet was held to celebrate a peace treaty. It was here that Phraates, offended by Lollius, disclosed the guardian's secret negotiations to Gaius. It was for the crime of extorting presents from kings (''regnum muneribus'') that Lollius lost the friendship of Gaius and drank poison. Pliny says he amassed a fortune from his crimes and that, as a result, his granddaughter could afford to wear jewelry worth 40,000,000 sesterces, a considerable amount of money.<ref name=Ferrero276-7/><ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D58 IX.58]</ref> The death of Lollius was fortunate to Tiberius, after which Gaius consented to his return to Rome and consequent return to Roman politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|p=285}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the throne of Armenia had become vacant and, with permission from the Emperor, Gaius placed [[Ariobarzanes II of Atropatene]] on the throne. The Romans weren't the only ones interested in Armenia: the Parthians stirred up a revolt among nationalists in the nation. A large force of rebels had occupied the fortress in the city of [[Artagira]]. Gaius was drawn into the conflict, and invaded Armenia in late August of 2 AD. He encountered no serious opposition as there were only a few revolts he had to suppress as a result of the nationalist party.<ref name=Velleius102>Velleius Paterculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#102 II.102]</ref>\n\nOn September 9, Abbadon, the leader of the rebellion, invited Gaius into the fortress to speak with him. It proved to be a trick, and Gaius was wounded in the confrontation. He had to be carried away by his outraged lieutenants. His forces promptly laid siege to the city and captured the fortress after intense fighting.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunson|2002|p=47}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sartre|2005|p=68}}</ref> At first the wound did not seem serious and he was able to complete the pacification of Armenia, a relatively easy task.<ref name=Dio10/><ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|p=286}}</ref><ref name=Velleius102/>\n\nBy the next year (3{{nbsp}}AD), he was entirely prostrated by the effects of his wound, had resigned his command, and withdrawn to Syria from where he informed Augustus that he had no further desire to take part in public life.<ref name=Dio10/><ref name=Velleius102/> The eastern campaign had proven severe: his health was weak and his mental balance unstable. At the age of twenty-three, the young man whom the Emperor considered his heir and sole hope of prosperity had abandoned his prospects of reputation and power in a wild fit of despair and fear. Augustus did his best to cheer him up and convince him to return to Italy. It was in vain: Gaius died in a little Lycian town on 21 February 4{{nbsp}}AD.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1909|pp=287\u2013288}}</ref>\n\n==Post mortem==\n[[File:MaisonCarr\u00e9e.jpeg|thumb|The ''[[Maison Carr\u00e9e]]'' (French: \"square house\") was dedicated in [[N\u00eemes|Nemausus]] to Gaius and Lucius.]]\n[[File:Limyra 3745.jpg|thumb|[[Limyra]] Cenotaph of Gaius Caesar]]\nWhile Gaius was in Armenia, his brother Lucius had been sent by Augustus to complete his military training in Spain. While there, he fell ill and died on 20 August 2{{nbsp}}AD in [[Marseille|Massalia]], [[Gaul]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mommsen|1996|p=107}}</ref> In the span of 18 months, the planned future of Rome was shaken.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augustus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/Augustus*.html#65 65]</ref> The deaths of both Gaius and Lucius, the Emperor's two most favored heirs, led Augustus to adopt his stepson [[Tiberius]] and his sole remaining grandson Postumus as his new heirs on 26 June 4{{nbsp}}AD.<ref name=Pettinger235/>\n\nMany honors were heaped upon Gaius by citizens and city officials of the Empire, including ''Colonia Obsequens Iulia Pisana'' ([[Pisa]]), where it was decreed that proper rites must be observed by matrons to lament his passing. Temples, public baths, and shops shut their doors as women wept inconsolably. To commemorate his brief life, a cenotaph was erected on the Limyrus River at [[Limyra]] in Lycia.<ref name=Powell192>{{harvnb|Powell|2015|p=192}}</ref> Posthumously, the Senate voted honors for the young Caesars, and arranged for the golden spears and shields the boys had received on achieving the age of military service to be hung in the Senate House.<ref name=Powell192/> The caskets containing their ashes were stored in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] alongside those of their father Agrippa and other members of the imperial family.<ref name=Powell192/>\n\nBoth [[Tacitus]] and Cassius Dio suggested foul play may have been involved in the death of Gaius and Lucius and that Gaius's step grandmother Livia may have had a hand in their deaths.

It was based upon the principle of \"[[Mens sana in corpore sano|a strong mind in a sound body]]\". The Sokol, through lectures, discussions, and group outings provided what Tyr\u0161 viewed as physical, moral, and intellectual training for the nation. This training extended to men of all ages and classes, and eventually to women.\n\nThe movement also spread across all the regions populated by Slavic cultures, most of them part of either Austria-Hungary or the [[Russian Empire]]: present-day [[Slovakia]], the [[Slovene Lands]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] ([[FK BASK|SK Soko]]), [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]] ([[Sok\u00f3\u0142]]), [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]]. In many of these nations, the organization also served as an early precursor to the [[Scouting]] movements. Though officially an institution \"above politics\", the Sokol played an important part in the development of [[Czech National Revival|Czech nationalism]] and patriotism, which found expression in articles published in the Sokol journal, lectures held in the Sokol libraries, and theatrical performances at the [[mass games|gymnastic mass festivals]] called ''slets''.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Image:Group of Sokols.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Members of the Sokol club in costume, 1880s <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nThe idea for physical training centers was not a new one. The Sokol movement consciously traced its roots in physical education to the athletes and warriors of [[Ancient Greece]]. More directly, the nature of the Sokol was influenced by the German [[Turnverein]], mass-based, nationalist-minded gymnastics societies founded by [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] in 1811.<ref name=ac>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Jahn, Friedrich Ludwig}}</ref>\n\nMiroslav Tyr\u0161, the founder of the first Sokol in Prague in 1862, continued as the most influential figure in the movement until his death in 1884. Born Friedrich Emanuel Tirsch into a German-speaking family in 1834, Tyr\u0161 grew up under the influence of the [[Romantic nationalism]] that gave rise to the uprisings that swept across Europe in 1848. He received a thorough education at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], where he majored in philosophy. It was not until the early 1860s that he became involved in the Czech nationalist cause, and changed his name to the Slavic form. After he failed to find a position in academia, Tyr\u0161 combined his experience working as a therapeutic gymnastics trainer with the nationalist ideologies he had been exposed to in Prague: the first Sokol club was formed.\n\nThe first Sokol worked to develop new Czech terminology for the training exercises, which centred on [[marching]] drills, [[fencing]], and [[Weight training|weightlifting]]. They designed a uniform that was a m\u00e9lange of Slavic and revolutionary influences: brown Russian trousers, a Polish revolutionary jacket, a [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] cap, and a red [[Garibaldi]] shirt. A Sokol flag, red with a white falcon, was designed by the writer [[Karol\u00edna Sv\u011btl\u00e1]] (and painted by Czech artist [[Josef M\u00e1nes]]).\n\nThe Prague Sokol initially drew its leaders from the ranks of politicians and its members from the [[petite bourgeoisie]] and the working classes. The first president was Jind\u0159ich F\u00fcgner, an ethnic German who was a member of the Czech cause. Most founders were also members of the [[Young Czechs]] party, the most influential including Prince Rudolf von Thurn-Taxis, Josef Bar\u00e1k, and [[Julius Gr\u00e9gr|Julius]] and [[Edvard Gregr|Eduard Gr\u00e9gr]]. The authorities of [[Austria-Hungary]] continually kept a close eye on the movement, but the reputation and prestige of the Sokol continued to grow; soon the Sokol members were known by most as the \"Czech national army\".\n\n==1860s and 1870s: Initial growth, militarization, and internal problems==\n[[Image:Poetry.jpg|thumb|upright|Live statue of poetry for Sokol festival, 1911 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nWithin the first year the Sokols expanded beyond Prague, first into the [[Moravia]] and the [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] regions of the Habsburg empire. Initially the majority of members were students and professionals, but over time there was a trend towards increasingly working class members.\n\nThe Sokol training went through periods of greater militarized training, during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, when Sokol members were hired as guards for public events. This militaristic side of the Sokol movement continued to resurface throughout its history.\n\nThe internal issues that were to plague the Sokol movement over the years emerged almost immediately. These internal arguments reached fruition during the 1870s with the power struggle in leadership between the members of [[Old Czechs]] and the [[Young Czechs]] parties. Theoretically, the Sokol was a society \u201cabove politics.\u201d Always flamboyantly nationalistic, the more conservative members of the Sokol argued that the organization should maintain its distance from politics while the Young Czech members advocated more direct political participation. Theoretically, the Sokol was also open equally to members of all classes. The informal \u201cthou\u201d (''ty'') was used by all members, but there were constant arguments over whether this was necessary or not. Different leaders believed that the Sokol was a mass-based institution defined by its working class members, while others viewed it more as a middle class apparatus by which to educate and raise the national consciousness of the working classes.\n\n==1880s: Slets and Sokol union==\n[[Image:slet1920.jpg|thumb|left|Slet in [[Prague]], 1920 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nIn 1882, the first [[mass games|slet]] was held.<ref>Margaret C. Brown, Betty K. Sommer: Movement Education: Its Evolution and a Modern Approach, Addison-Wesley, 1969, page 23:<br/>''In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Sokol organization, the first \"Slet\" Festival was held in 1882''</ref> ''Slet'' came from the Czech word for \"a flocking of birds\" (Czech plural: ''slety''). The same word exists or can be synthesized from common Slavic roots in other Slavic languages. It meant a [[Mass games|mass gymnastics]] (1572 Sokols) festival that became a grand tradition within the Sokol movement that spread across Central Europe together with other Slavic movements such as the political movement of [[Pan-Slavism]]. The first and subsequent slets included an elaborate welcoming ceremony at the train station, mass demonstrations, gymnastics competitions, speeches, and theatrical events, open to members of all Sokols.\n\nIn 1887 the Habsburg authorities finally allowed, after over twenty years worth of proposals, the formation of a union of Sokol clubs &ndash; Czech Sokol Community (''\u010cesk\u00e1 obec sokolsk\u00e1'', \u010cOS). The union centralized all the Sokols in the [[Czech lands]] and sent Sokol trainers to the rest of the Slavic world to found Sokol institutions in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Zagreb]], [[Sarajevo]] and even the [[Russian Empire]] ([[FC Spartak Moscow]]) (mostly the Ukrainian lands).\n\nIn 1889, though officially forbidden by the authorities, members of the Prague Sokol went to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|World's Fair]] in [[Paris]]. There they won several medals and established strong connections with French gymnasts and the French public.<ref>Museum, Volumes 43-44, Volume 187 of Unesco publication, UNESCO., 1991 p. 68</ref> The Sokols have been credited with establishing the beginning of the strong French sympathy for the Czechs and their subsequent political alliances on this trip.<ref>J.

In order to encourage a wider range of participation, the Sokols reformed their programs, offering training sessions of varying intensities, extending their libraries, emphasizing the educational aspect of training, and starting programs for adolescents, youth, and women. There was an increasing focus on mass-based ideology and working class egalitarianism under the leadership of the Young Czechs, namely Jan Podlipn\u00fd, who was also the [[List of mayors of Prague|mayor of Prague]] 1897\u20131900.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.praha.eu/jnp/en/city_hall/mayor_of_prague/they_led_the_city/judr_jan_podlipny.html |title=JUDr. Jan Podlipn\u00fd (Portal of Prague) |publisher=Praha.eu |date=1914-03-19 |accessdate=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140508102906/http://www.praha.eu/jnp/en/city_hall/mayor_of_prague/they_led_the_city/judr_jan_podlipny.html |archivedate=2014-05-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe second slet was held in 1891 (over 5,000 Sokols) and the third one soon afterwards in 1895. At this third slet the congress of the Sokol union laid out its progressive new trajectory in the [[St. Wenceslas]] Day (September 28) Resolutions. The leaders chose to continue to provide more accessible forms of training, with less focus on competition and more on an egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics balancing mental as well as physical education.\n\n==1900\u20131914: Competitors and neo-Slavism==\n[[Image:slet1901.jpg|thumb|right|Jumping over horse at the fourth ''slet'', 1901 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nThe rise of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and agrarian parties in the political arena played out in Sokol politics as well as national ones. The Social Democrats formed a rival gymnastics society, the Workers' Gymnastics Club (''D\u011blnick\u00e1 t\u011blov\u00fdchovn\u00e1 jednota'', DTJ).  V\u00e1clav Kuka\u0159, a powerful \u010cOS figure, developed the policy of \"cleansing\" (''o\u010di\u0161t\u011bn\u00ed'') and sought to limit membership to those who he believed demonstrated commitment to purely Czech causes. Most of the progressive members of the Sokols were purged or left voluntarily to join the DTJ. Another rival gymnast society was founded by the Christian-Socialist party under the name [[Orel (movement)|Orel]] (\"Eagle\"). In the face of such competition, the Sokols set about reaffirming their traditional mission under the leadership of Josef Scheiner.\n\n[[File:Towarzystwo Gimnastyczne Sok\u00f3\u0142 Pozna\u0144.jpg|thumb|left|Nest of [[Sok\u00f3\u0142|Polish Sokols]] from [[Pozna\u0144]] city in 1932.]]\n\nThe fourth slet, held in 1901 (11,000 Sokols), boasted a large international participation, including [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Slovenes]], [[Croats]], [[Russians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], as well as [[Frenchmen]] and [[United States|Americans]]. This slet also marked the first appearance of women who grew to be a major part of Sokol members in the following decades.\n\nThe fifth slet, held in 1907 (over 12,000 Sokols), had an increasingly Slavic focus and moved away from the more egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics with increased competition aspects. It marked the creation of the [[Federation of Slavic Sokols]] under the [[neo-Slavic]] idea of the Czechs as the strongest Slavic nation, second only to Russia.\n\nAt the 1910 meeting of the \u010cOS congress the sokols reaffirmed their intentions to remain \"above politics\" and loosened their strict membership rules to allow Social Democrats, though still not clericals, into the sokols.\n\nIn 1912, the first \"All-Slavic Slet\" (''V\u0161eslovansk\u00fd slet'', over 30,000 Sokols) was held with a largely military atmosphere, causing [[Augustin O\u010den\u00e1\u0161ek]] (a member of Sokol) to remark, \"When the thunder comes and the nations rise up to defend their existence, let it be the Sokol clubs from which the cry to battle will sound...\".<ref>Nolte, p. 78.</ref> The cry to battle did sound two years later, when the first rumors of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]]'s assassination reached the Sokol members, most of whom were attending a regional slet in [[Brno]].\n\n==World War I to Communism: Continued struggle of Czech nationalism==\n[[Image:Sokol1924.jpg|thumb|right|Exercises in [[T\u00e1bor]], 1924 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nWith the onset of [[World War I]], in 1915 the Sokols were officially disbanded. Many members were active in persuading the Czechs to defect from the Austro-Hungarian army to the Russian side. Sokol members also helped create the [[Czechoslovak Legion]]s and local patrols that kept order after the disintegration of Habsburg authority, and during the creation of Czechoslovakia in October 1918. <ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

The Sokols held one last slet (350,000 Sokols) on the eve of the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 and were later brutally suppressed and banned during the [[Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia|Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia]].\n\n==Sokol society among South Slavs==\n[[File:Sokol society \"Du\u0161an the Mighty\", Kragujevac, 1910.jpg|thumb|Sokol society ''[[Du\u0161an the Mighty]]'', [[Kragujevac]], 1910]]\nSlovenes organise gymnastic society  1. October 1863 and named it Ju\u017eni Sokol (South Falcon).  Sokol societies were introduced in Slovenia by Viktor Murnik in the last decade of 19th century. V. Murnik was good gymnast. He was inspired by Czech's Sokols profession and studied Tyr\u0161's gymnastics\nbases.<ref>Toma\u017e Pavlin: Sokol movement in Slovenia - 150TH anniversary of Ju\u017eni Sokol, Science of Gymnastics Journal, Vol. 5 Issue 3: 5 - 18  Ljubljana 2013</ref> The 1903 All-Sokols Rally was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, Croatian Sokol societies were united with Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919.\n\nThe Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the Yugoslav Sokol Alliance in 1919\u201320, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, senior Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (Eagles) clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that \"a brother is dear regardless of his faith\". The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (Eagles) and Katoli\u010dka Akcija (Catholic Action) were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church's resistance to this idea of pan-Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international All Sokol Rally held in Prague in 1926.<ref>Viktor Novak: Magnum Crimen Ecclesia militants at war with the ideology of Tyr\u0161, Gambit, Jagodina Serbia 2005 {{ISBN|86-7624-030-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia all Sokol societes were merged into the Union of Sokols of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as of December 1929. The Eagles were ordered to disband but they reinvented as religious fraternities. This way the Sokol movement was the principal agent of the drive for cultural synthesis of the Yugoslav society. Honorary mayor of Yugoslav Sokol was Prince [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]].<ref>Christian Axboe Nielsen: Making Yugoslavs: Identity in King Aleksandar's Yugoslavia, University of Toronto Press, 2014, p. 113 {{ISBN|9781442627505}}</ref>\n\n==In emigration==\n[[File:Physical Fitness Sokol 5c 1965 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|left|upright|thumb|1965 U.S. commemorative stamp]]\nMembers of Sokol who emigrated from Czechoslovakia set up small Sokol groups abroad.  This Sokol migration, for a variety of reasons, began even before Czechoslovakia became a nation in 1918, intensified as a result of the World Wars and the Communist suppression, and continues to this day. Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak immigrants and Czech-American citizens started the American Sokol Organization in [https://web.archive.org/web/19990828032157/http://www.geocities.com/%7Eacec-stl/sokol/stl.htm St. Louis Missouri in 1865], only three years after the first Prague Sokol.  Units quickly formed and by 1878, the United States had 13 Sokol chapters.  By 1937, American Sokol membership rolls counted nearly 20,000 adults in areas as far-flung as [[Baltimore]] https://www.sokolbaltimore.org/history, [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Oakland]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oklahoma]], [[St. Louis]], [[Texas]], Nyack and parts of [[Canada]].

Its popularity is, however, well below pre-war levels and a large percentage of members are older people with memories of the pre-1948 Sokol movement. Other members are mainly parents who register their kids for physical activities. A further ''slet'' was held in 2000 (25,000 Sokols); another was held in July 2006.

It was based upon the principle of \"[[Mens sana in corpore sano|a strong mind in a sound body]]\". The Sokol, through lectures, discussions, and group outings provided what Tyr\u0161 viewed as physical, moral, and intellectual training for the nation. This training extended to men of all ages and classes, and eventually to women.\n\nThe movement also spread across all the regions populated by Slavic cultures, most of them part of either Austria-Hungary or the [[Russian Empire]]: present-day [[Slovakia]], the [[Slovene Lands]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] ([[FK BASK|SK Soko]]), [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]] ([[Sok\u00f3\u0142]]), [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]]. In many of these nations, the organization also served as an early precursor to the [[Scouting]] movements. Though officially an institution \"above politics\", the Sokol played an important part in the development of [[Czech National Revival|Czech nationalism]] and patriotism, which found expression in articles published in the Sokol journal, lectures held in the Sokol libraries, and theatrical performances at the [[mass games|gymnastic mass festivals]] called ''slets''.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Image:Group of Sokols.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Members of the Sokol club in costume, 1880s <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nThe idea for physical training centers was not a new one. The Sokol movement consciously traced its roots in physical education to the athletes and warriors of [[Ancient Greece]]. More directly, the nature of the Sokol was influenced by the German [[Turnverein]], mass-based, nationalist-minded gymnastics societies founded by [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] in 1811.<ref name=ac>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Jahn, Friedrich Ludwig}}</ref>\n\nMiroslav Tyr\u0161, the founder of the first Sokol in Prague in 1862, continued as the most influential figure in the movement until his death in 1884. Born Friedrich Emanuel Tirsch into a German-speaking family in 1834, Tyr\u0161 grew up under the influence of the [[Romantic nationalism]] that gave rise to the uprisings that swept across Europe in 1848. He received a thorough education at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], where he majored in philosophy. It was not until the early 1860s that he became involved in the Czech nationalist cause, and changed his name to the Slavic form. After he failed to find a position in academia, Tyr\u0161 combined his experience working as a therapeutic gymnastics trainer with the nationalist ideologies he had been exposed to in Prague: the first Sokol club was formed.\n\nThe first Sokol worked to develop new Czech terminology for the training exercises, which centred on [[marching]] drills, [[fencing]], and [[Weight training|weightlifting]]. They designed a uniform that was a m\u00e9lange of Slavic and revolutionary influences: brown Russian trousers, a Polish revolutionary jacket, a [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] cap, and a red [[Garibaldi]] shirt. A Sokol flag, red with a white falcon, was designed by the writer [[Karol\u00edna Sv\u011btl\u00e1]] (and painted by Czech artist [[Josef M\u00e1nes]]).\n\nThe Prague Sokol initially drew its leaders from the ranks of politicians and its members from the [[petite bourgeoisie]] and the working classes. The first president was Jind\u0159ich F\u00fcgner, an ethnic German who was a member of the Czech cause. Most founders were also members of the [[Young Czechs]] party, the most influential including Prince Rudolf von Thurn-Taxis, Josef Bar\u00e1k, and [[Julius Gr\u00e9gr|Julius]] and [[Edvard Gregr|Eduard Gr\u00e9gr]]. The authorities of [[Austria-Hungary]] continually kept a close eye on the movement, but the reputation and prestige of the Sokol continued to grow; soon the Sokol members were known by most as the \"Czech national army\".\n\n==1860s and 1870s: Initial growth, militarization, and internal problems==\n[[Image:Poetry.jpg|thumb|upright|Live statue of poetry for Sokol festival, 1911 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nWithin the first year the Sokols expanded beyond Prague, first into the [[Moravia]] and the [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] regions of the Habsburg empire. Initially the majority of members were students and professionals, but over time there was a trend towards increasingly working class members.\n\nThe Sokol training went through periods of greater militarized training, during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, when Sokol members were hired as guards for public events. This militaristic side of the Sokol movement continued to resurface throughout its history.\n\nThe internal issues that were to plague the Sokol movement over the years emerged almost immediately. These internal arguments reached fruition during the 1870s with the power struggle in leadership between the members of [[Old Czechs]] and the [[Young Czechs]] parties. Theoretically, the Sokol was a society \u201cabove politics.\u201d Always flamboyantly nationalistic, the more conservative members of the Sokol argued that the organization should maintain its distance from politics while the Young Czech members advocated more direct political participation. Theoretically, the Sokol was also open equally to members of all classes. The informal \u201cthou\u201d (''ty'') was used by all members, but there were constant arguments over whether this was necessary or not. Different leaders believed that the Sokol was a mass-based institution defined by its working class members, while others viewed it more as a middle class apparatus by which to educate and raise the national consciousness of the working classes.\n\n==1880s: Slets and Sokol union==\n[[Image:slet1920.jpg|thumb|left|Slet in [[Prague]], 1920 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nIn 1882, the first [[mass games|slet]] was held.<ref>Margaret C. Brown, Betty K. Sommer: Movement Education: Its Evolution and a Modern Approach, Addison-Wesley, 1969, page 23:<br/>''In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Sokol organization, the first \"Slet\" Festival was held in 1882''</ref> ''Slet'' came from the Czech word for \"a flocking of birds\" (Czech plural: ''slety''). The same word exists or can be synthesized from common Slavic roots in other Slavic languages. It meant a [[Mass games|mass gymnastics]] (1572 Sokols) festival that became a grand tradition within the Sokol movement that spread across Central Europe together with other Slavic movements such as the political movement of [[Pan-Slavism]]. The first and subsequent slets included an elaborate welcoming ceremony at the train station, mass demonstrations, gymnastics competitions, speeches, and theatrical events, open to members of all Sokols.\n\nIn 1887 the Habsburg authorities finally allowed, after over twenty years worth of proposals, the formation of a union of Sokol clubs &ndash; Czech Sokol Community (''\u010cesk\u00e1 obec sokolsk\u00e1'', \u010cOS). The union centralized all the Sokols in the [[Czech lands]] and sent Sokol trainers to the rest of the Slavic world to found Sokol institutions in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Zagreb]], [[Sarajevo]] and even the [[Russian Empire]] ([[FC Spartak Moscow]]) (mostly the Ukrainian lands).\n\nIn 1889, though officially forbidden by the authorities, members of the Prague Sokol went to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|World's Fair]] in [[Paris]]. There they won several medals and established strong connections with French gymnasts and the French public.<ref>Museum, Volumes 43-44, Volume 187 of Unesco publication, UNESCO., 1991 p. 68</ref> The Sokols have been credited with establishing the beginning of the strong French sympathy for the Czechs and their subsequent political alliances on this trip.<ref>J.

In order to encourage a wider range of participation, the Sokols reformed their programs, offering training sessions of varying intensities, extending their libraries, emphasizing the educational aspect of training, and starting programs for adolescents, youth, and women. There was an increasing focus on mass-based ideology and working class egalitarianism under the leadership of the Young Czechs, namely Jan Podlipn\u00fd, who was also the [[List of mayors of Prague|mayor of Prague]] 1897\u20131900.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.praha.eu/jnp/en/city_hall/mayor_of_prague/they_led_the_city/judr_jan_podlipny.html |title=JUDr. Jan Podlipn\u00fd (Portal of Prague) |publisher=Praha.eu |date=1914-03-19 |accessdate=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140508102906/http://www.praha.eu/jnp/en/city_hall/mayor_of_prague/they_led_the_city/judr_jan_podlipny.html |archivedate=2014-05-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe second slet was held in 1891 (over 5,000 Sokols) and the third one soon afterwards in 1895. At this third slet the congress of the Sokol union laid out its progressive new trajectory in the [[St. Wenceslas]] Day (September 28) Resolutions. The leaders chose to continue to provide more accessible forms of training, with less focus on competition and more on an egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics balancing mental as well as physical education.\n\n==1900\u20131914: Competitors and neo-Slavism==\n[[Image:slet1901.jpg|thumb|right|Jumping over horse at the fourth ''slet'', 1901 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nThe rise of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and agrarian parties in the political arena played out in Sokol politics as well as national ones. The Social Democrats formed a rival gymnastics society, the Workers' Gymnastics Club (''D\u011blnick\u00e1 t\u011blov\u00fdchovn\u00e1 jednota'', DTJ).  V\u00e1clav Kuka\u0159, a powerful \u010cOS figure, developed the policy of \"cleansing\" (''o\u010di\u0161t\u011bn\u00ed'') and sought to limit membership to those who he believed demonstrated commitment to purely Czech causes. Most of the progressive members of the Sokols were purged or left voluntarily to join the DTJ. Another rival gymnast society was founded by the Christian-Socialist party under the name [[Orel (movement)|Orel]] (\"Eagle\"). In the face of such competition, the Sokols set about reaffirming their traditional mission under the leadership of Josef Scheiner.\n\n[[File:Towarzystwo Gimnastyczne Sok\u00f3\u0142 Pozna\u0144.jpg|thumb|left|Nest of [[Sok\u00f3\u0142|Polish Sokols]] from [[Pozna\u0144]] city in 1932.]]\n\nThe fourth slet, held in 1901 (11,000 Sokols), boasted a large international participation, including [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Slovenes]], [[Croats]], [[Russians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], as well as [[Frenchmen]] and [[United States|Americans]]. This slet also marked the first appearance of women who grew to be a major part of Sokol members in the following decades.\n\nThe fifth slet, held in 1907 (over 12,000 Sokols), had an increasingly Slavic focus and moved away from the more egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics with increased competition aspects. It marked the creation of the [[Federation of Slavic Sokols]] under the [[neo-Slavic]] idea of the Czechs as the strongest Slavic nation, second only to Russia.\n\nAt the 1910 meeting of the \u010cOS congress the sokols reaffirmed their intentions to remain \"above politics\" and loosened their strict membership rules to allow Social Democrats, though still not clericals, into the sokols.\n\nIn 1912, the first \"All-Slavic Slet\" (''V\u0161eslovansk\u00fd slet'', over 30,000 Sokols) was held with a largely military atmosphere, causing [[Augustin O\u010den\u00e1\u0161ek]] (a member of Sokol) to remark, \"When the thunder comes and the nations rise up to defend their existence, let it be the Sokol clubs from which the cry to battle will sound...\".<ref>Nolte, p. 78.</ref> The cry to battle did sound two years later, when the first rumors of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]]'s assassination reached the Sokol members, most of whom were attending a regional slet in [[Brno]].\n\n==World War I to Communism: Continued struggle of Czech nationalism==\n[[Image:Sokol1924.jpg|thumb|right|Exercises in [[T\u00e1bor]], 1924 <br>photographed by [[\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek]] ]]\n\nWith the onset of [[World War I]], in 1915 the Sokols were officially disbanded. Many members were active in persuading the Czechs to defect from the Austro-Hungarian army to the Russian side. Sokol members also helped create the [[Czechoslovak Legion]]s and local patrols that kept order after the disintegration of Habsburg authority, and during the creation of Czechoslovakia in October 1918. <ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

The Sokols held one last slet (350,000 Sokols) on the eve of the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 and were later brutally suppressed and banned during the [[Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia|Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia]].\n\n==Sokol society among South Slavs==\n[[File:Sokol society \"Du\u0161an the Mighty\", Kragujevac, 1910.jpg|thumb|Sokol society ''[[Du\u0161an the Mighty]]'', [[Kragujevac]], 1910]]\nSlovenes organise gymnastic society  1. October 1863 and named it Ju\u017eni Sokol (South Falcon).  Sokol societies were introduced in Slovenia by Viktor Murnik in the last decade of 19th century. V. Murnik was good gymnast.

After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, Croatian Sokol societies were united with Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919.\n\nThe Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the Yugoslav Sokol Alliance in 1919\u201320, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, senior Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (Eagles) clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that \"a brother is dear regardless of his faith\". The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (Eagles) and Katoli\u010dka Akcija (Catholic Action) were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church's resistance to this idea of pan-Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international All Sokol Rally held in Prague in 1926.<ref>Viktor Novak: Magnum Crimen Ecclesia militants at war with the ideology of Tyr\u0161, Gambit, Jagodina Serbia 2005 {{ISBN|86-7624-030-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia all Sokol societes were merged into the Union of Sokols of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as of December 1929. The Eagles were ordered to disband but they reinvented as religious fraternities. This way the Sokol movement was the principal agent of the drive for cultural synthesis of the Yugoslav society.

This Sokol migration, for a variety of reasons, began even before Czechoslovakia became a nation in 1918, intensified as a result of the World Wars and the Communist suppression, and continues to this day. Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak immigrants and Czech-American citizens started the American Sokol Organization in [https://web.archive.org/web/19990828032157/http://www.geocities.com/%7Eacec-stl/sokol/stl.htm St. Louis Missouri in 1865], only three years after the first Prague Sokol.  Units quickly formed and by 1878, the United States had 13 Sokol chapters.  By 1937, American Sokol membership rolls counted nearly 20,000 adults in areas as far-flung as [[Baltimore]] https://www.sokolbaltimore.org/history, [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Oakland]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oklahoma]], [[St. Louis]], [[Texas]], Nyack and parts of [[Canada]].

Its popularity is, however, well below pre-war levels and a large percentage of members are older people with memories of the pre-1948 Sokol movement. Other members are mainly parents who register their kids for physical activities. A further ''slet'' was held in 2000 (25,000 Sokols); another was held in July 2006.
