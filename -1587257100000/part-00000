Clark\u2013Sheard recorded two more live albums, including ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'' and ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'' (which featured some studio recordings), before releasing ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]]'', Clark\u2013Sheard's first all-studio-recorded album in 13 years.

She released her Elektra debut album ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'' in 2002 (so named because of the \"second chance\" she was given by [[God]] after her near-death experience \u2013 which is referenced in her daughter Kierra's song \"[[You Don't Know (Kierra Sheard song)|You Don't Know]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur7588.cfm|title=Karen Clark Sheard Gets '2nd Chance'|publisher=EURweb.com|author1=McIntyre, Donald  |author2=Kiel, Danna|date=August 1, 2002}}</ref> The album was led off by the single \"Be Sure\" and though Clark\u2013Sheard was in excellent form vocally, the slick, progressive sound of the disc was not received well in the gospel community.  However, the album still performed well commercially and critically reaching #82 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200, #27 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (her highest chartings on those charts to date) and #2 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Gospel Albums.\n====The Heavens Are Telling====\n{{Main|The Heavens Are Telling}}\nThe 2003 followup ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'' fared well, but came at an awkward time when Elektra Records was being dissolved into [[Atlantic Records]] and so failed to match the commercial success of Clark-Sheard's previous albums, peaking a whole 106 places below ''2nd Chance'' at #188 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 \u2013 though it managed to reach a respectable #44 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, a high #3 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Gospel Albums chart and was her first album to chart on the [[Billboard charts|U.S. ''Billboard'' Christian Albums]] chart, where it peaked at #11.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=karen clark-sheard|chart=all}}|title=The Heavens Are Telling \u2013 Karen Clark Sheard|publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref>\n====It's Not Over====\n{{Main|It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)}}\nIn 2005, after a bidding war with several labels, Clark-Sheard finally signed with Word Records and issued ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', (Originally titled ''Finally Karen Returns''), the sequel to her 1997 debut album ''[[Finally Karen]]'' was set to be released November 15, 2005, Clark-Sheard's 45th birthday, but was delayed and released the following year. Most of ''It's Not Over'' was recorded live in 2005 at Karen's home church in Detroit, Michigan while the last three tracks were studio-recorded. \n\nIt was Clark-Sheard's first solo album not to feature guest vocals from her daughter (Kierra Sheard) and was the first to include production from [[Israel Houghton]] \u2013 who handled the majority of the project. Despite having a much grander sound than her previous albums, it was another critical success for Karen and charted modestly at #124 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 and #4 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/><ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=karen clark-sheard|chart=all}}|title=It's Not Over \u2013 Karen Clark Sheard|publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref> As the songwriter, on February 10, 2008, Clark-Sheard won the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song]] for \"Blessed & Highly Favored\" sung by [[The Clark Sisters]].\n====Karew Records, 5th album and present====\n{{Main|All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)}}\nIn early 2009, Clark-Sheard and her husband, J.Drew Sheard partnered together and launched a new record label entitled [[Karew Records]] (Karew being a combination of both their forenames: Karen & Drew, pronounced: Kuh-rue); Distribution is via EMI Gospel.

She released her Elektra debut album ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'' in 2002 (so named because of the \"second chance\" she was given by [[God]] after her near-death experience \u2013 which is referenced in her daughter Kierra's song \"[[You Don't Know (Kierra Sheard song)|You Don't Know]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur7588.cfm|title=Karen Clark Sheard Gets '2nd Chance'|publisher=EURweb.com|author1=McIntyre, Donald  |author2=Kiel, Danna|date=August 1, 2002}}</ref> The album was led off by the single \"Be Sure\" and though Clark\u2013Sheard was in excellent form vocally, the slick, progressive sound of the disc was not received well in the gospel community.  However, the album still performed well commercially and critically reaching #82 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200, #27 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (her highest chartings on those charts to date) and #2 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Gospel Albums.\n====The Heavens Are Telling====\n{{Main|The Heavens Are Telling}}\nThe 2003 followup ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'' fared well, but came at an awkward time when Elektra Records was being dissolved into [[Atlantic Records]] and so failed to match the commercial success of Clark-Sheard's previous albums, peaking a whole 106 places below ''2nd Chance'' at #188 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 \u2013 though it managed to reach a respectable #44 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, a high #3 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Gospel Albums chart and was her first album to chart on the [[Billboard charts|U.S. ''Billboard'' Christian Albums]] chart, where it peaked at #11.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=karen clark-sheard|chart=all}}|title=The Heavens Are Telling \u2013 Karen Clark Sheard|publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref>\n====It's Not Over====\n{{Main|It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)}}\nIn 2005, after a bidding war with several labels, Clark-Sheard finally signed with Word Records and issued ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', (Originally titled ''Finally Karen Returns''), the sequel to her 1997 debut album ''[[Finally Karen]]'' was set to be released November 15, 2005, Clark-Sheard's 45th birthday, but was delayed and released the following year.

Despite having a much grander sound than her previous albums, it was another critical success for Karen and charted modestly at #124 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 and #4 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/><ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=karen clark-sheard|chart=all}}|title=It's Not Over \u2013 Karen Clark Sheard|publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref> As the songwriter, on February 10, 2008, Clark-Sheard won the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song]] for \"Blessed & Highly Favored\" sung by [[The Clark Sisters]].\n====Karew Records, 5th album and present====\n{{Main|All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)}}\nIn early 2009, Clark-Sheard and her husband, J.Drew Sheard partnered together and launched a new record label entitled [[Karew Records]] (Karew being a combination of both their forenames: Karen & Drew, pronounced: Kuh-rue); Distribution is via EMI Gospel.

The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film is scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, Neo is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She suggests to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, Cypher is killed by [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.

The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film is scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, Neo is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She suggests to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, Cypher is killed by [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia.

Belief in Allah requires recognizing that He is the only one worthy of our devotion, supplications, and worship.\n* [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Belief in all the Prophets of God]]; Adam, Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Isaac (Ishaq), Jacob (Yaqub), Josep (Yusuf), Moses (Musa), Aaron (Harun), John the Baptist (Yahya), Jesus (Isa), and Muhammad (Peace and Blessing Upon Them All), as well as those not mentioned.

This testimony pronounced to become a Muslim, and is repeated several times a day in prayers and devotions as an affirmation of God's oneness and a confirmation of faith.\n* [[Salah]]: ''Formal prayer five times a day''. By praying five times a day, one actively submits his will to God Almighty and devotes his mind, body, and soul to his worship. Formal prayer is both preventative and prescriptive; it serves as a reminder to avoid evil deeds and helps to expiate the effects of any sin committed throughout the day.\n* [[Fasting in Islam|Siyam]]: ''Fasting during the month of Ramadan''. During Ramadan, Muslims fast each day from dawn to dusk by refraining from food, drinks and sensual pleasures. These outward actions have an effect on the inward, reminding believers that instead of being dependent on corporeal stimuli, they must rely on God Almighty alone. Abstaining from food & drink serves another purpose, that is to remind the believer of his duty to those [[Poverty|less fortunate]] amongst fellow man, and that with God's bounties comes responsibility to our brothers and sisters in humanity.\n* [[Zakat]]: ''Alms to the Poor.'' With the blessing of wealth comes responsibility to give back to those less fortunate. Zakat, the Arabic word for obligatory alms, is a purification of wealth and a method of redistributing wealth to those in need.\n* [[Hajj]]: ''Pilgrimage to Mecca at least once, if physically and financially able''.
