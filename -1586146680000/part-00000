Between the two faces juts a massive prow. While today there are numerous established routes on both faces, the most popular and historically famous route is ''The Nose'', which follows the massive prow.\n\n==First ascents==\nOnce thought to be unclimbable, the high granite walls of Yosemite Valley began to see their first attempts and first ascents in the late 1950s. One of the most coveted routes was the [[Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome|Northwest Face of Half Dome]], and among those coveting it was Californian [[Warren Harding (climber)|Warren Harding]]. He made an unsuccessful attempt on Half Dome in 1955, and returned for the 1957 season just as [[Royal Robbins]] and team were completing the first ascent. \"My congratulations,\" Harding recounted, \"were hearty and sincere, but inside, the ambitious dreamer in me was troubled.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Doug Scott |title=Big Wall Climbing |url=https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot/page/147 147]}}</ref>\n\nHarding turned to an even larger unclimbed face, the {{convert|2900|ft|m|-2}} prow of El Capitan, at the other end of the valley. With Mark Powell and Bill \"Dolt\" Feuerer, they began the climb in July 1957. Rather than follow the single-push \"alpine\" style used on Half Dome, they chose to fix lines between \"camps\" in the style used in the Himalaya. Attempting to get half way on the first push, they were foiled by the huge cracks, and Feuerer was required to form new rock spikes or [[piton]]s by cutting off the legs of wood stoves. This gave the name to the crack system leading to the half way point, the \"stove leg cracks\".\n\nCompelled by the National Park Service to stop until March due to the crowds forming in El Capitan meadows as soon as the snow melts, the team had a major setback when Powell suffered a compound leg fracture on another climbing trip. Waits at the base of The Nose and Korengals easily reach 50 hours. Powell dropped out, and Feuerer became disillusioned. Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, \"continued\", as he later put it, \"with whatever 'qualified' climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.\"<ref name=AAJ>{{cite journal |author=Warren Harding |title=El Capitan |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1959 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1959/184_Harding_ElCapitan_aaj1959.pdf}}</ref>  Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled cart which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, \"Dolt Tower\"; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the fall, two more pushes got them to the {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with {{convert|1/2|in|mm|0}} manila lines, and their in situ lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, the seven days it took to push to within the last {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} blurring into a \"monotonous grind\" if, Harding adds, \"living and working {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} above the ground on a granite face\" could be considered monotonous.<ref name=AAJ/>  After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours through the night, hand-placed 28 expansion bolts up an overhanging headwall before topping out at 6&nbsp;AM. The complete climb had taken 45 days, with more than {{convert|3400|ft|m|-2}} of climbing including huge pendulum swings across the face, the labor of hauling bags, and rappel descents.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the classics of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Doyle |title=House Honors First Climbers to Scale El Capitan |publisher=McClatchy News Service |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/53336.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194756/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/01/53336/house-honors-first-climbers-to.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe second ascent was made in 1960 by [[Royal Robbins]], [[Joe Fitschen]], [[Chuck Pratt]] and [[Tom Frost]], who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics.<ref name=fifty/> The first [[roped solo climbing|rope-solo climb]] of The Nose was made by Tom Bauman in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mountaineering in Patagonia |author=Alan Kearney |page=67 |year=1993 |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |isbn=0-938567-30-6}}</ref> The first ascent of ''The Nose'' in one day was accomplished in 1975 by [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], [[Jim Bridwell]] and [[Billy Westbay]].

In 1993, [[Lynn Hill]] came close to freeing ''The Nose'', making it past the ''Great Roof'' and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on ''Changing Corners'' by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold.<ref name=McNamara/> After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb ''The Nose''.

Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, \"continued\", as he later put it, \"with whatever 'qualified' climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.\"<ref name=AAJ>{{cite journal |author=Warren Harding |title=El Capitan |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1959 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1959/184_Harding_ElCapitan_aaj1959.pdf}}</ref>  Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled cart which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, \"Dolt Tower\"; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the fall, two more pushes got them to the {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with {{convert|1/2|in|mm|0}} manila lines, and their in situ lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, the seven days it took to push to within the last {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} blurring into a \"monotonous grind\" if, Harding adds, \"living and working {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} above the ground on a granite face\" could be considered monotonous.<ref name=AAJ/>  After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours through the night, hand-placed 28 expansion bolts up an overhanging headwall before topping out at 6&nbsp;AM. The complete climb had taken 45 days, with more than {{convert|3400|ft|m|-2}} of climbing including huge pendulum swings across the face, the labor of hauling bags, and rappel descents.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the classics of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Doyle |title=House Honors First Climbers to Scale El Capitan |publisher=McClatchy News Service |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/53336.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194756/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/01/53336/house-honors-first-climbers-to.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe second ascent was made in 1960 by [[Royal Robbins]], [[Joe Fitschen]], [[Chuck Pratt]] and [[Tom Frost]], who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics.<ref name=fifty/> The first [[roped solo climbing|rope-solo climb]] of The Nose was made by Tom Bauman in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mountaineering in Patagonia |author=Alan Kearney |page=67 |year=1993 |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |isbn=0-938567-30-6}}</ref> The first ascent of ''The Nose'' in one day was accomplished in 1975 by [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], [[Jim Bridwell]] and [[Billy Westbay]].

After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb ''The Nose''.

Allen 2006 p.187\" /> His most notable discourse in this regard is his fourth [[homily]] on {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26\u201327|ESV}}, where he argued that those who have sex with the same gender must do so because they are insane: \"''All of these affections then were vile, but chiefly the mad lust after males; for the soul is more the sufferer in sins, and more dishonored than the body in diseases. ... [The men] have done an insult to nature itself. And a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it, when even the women seek after these intercourses, who ought to have more shame than men.''\"<ref name=\"iF4FR\" /> He went on to describe homosexuality as a worse sin than murder.<ref name=\"6F3vj\" /> Punishment will be found in [[hell]] for such transgressors.<ref name=\"YWAAAAYAAJ 1841, p. 44-52\" /> He noted that women could also be guilty of the sin as much as men (although the former additionally disrupted the [[patriarchal]] hierarchy through such as act).\"<ref name=\"YWAAAAYAAJ 1841, p. 44-52\" /> Chrysostom believed that the male passive partner had effectively renounced his manhood and become a woman \u2013 such an individual deserved to be killed - \"driven out and stoned\".<ref name=\"Robert H. Allen 2006 p.187\" /> Chrysostom was particularly influential in shaping early Christian thought that same-sex desire was an evil that ultimately resulted in social injustice \u2013 altering the traditional interpretation of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a place of inhospitality, to one where the sexual transgressions of the Sodomites became paramount.<ref name=\"KO9kx\" />\n\n===Early Church Councils===\n\nCanon law regulating same-sex sexual activity has mainly been shaped through the decrees issued by a number of ecclesiastical councils.<ref name=\"Derrick S. Bailey 1955, p185\" /> Initially, canons against sodomy were aimed at ensuring clerical or monastic discipline, and were only widened in the medieval period to include laymen.<ref name=\"fordham.edu\" />\n\nThe early 4th-century [[Council of Elvira]] (305-306) was the first church council to deal with the issue directly, excluding from [[Holy Communion]] anyone who had sexual intercourse (''[[stuprum]]'') with a boy:<ref name=\"Elvira\" /><ref name=\"8WFYJ\" /><ref name=\"O3Zb7\" />\n\nCanons 16 and 17 of the [[Council of Ancyra]] (c.e. 314), which \"became the standard source for medieval ecclesiastical literature against homosexuality\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> imposed on \"those who have been or who are guilty of bestial lusts\" penances whose severity varies with the age and married status of the offender, allowing access to communion only at death for a married man over fifty years old (canon 16); and imposed a penance also on \"defilers of themselves with beasts, being also leprous, who have infected others [with the leprosy of this crime]\".<ref name=\"3HcIc\" />\n\nThere are examples of punishments. In the sixth century, the Greek chronicler [[John Malalas]] recorded that a certain Isaiah (the Bishop of Rhodes) and Alexander (Bishop of Diopolis), had been punished by the Prefect of Thrace for \"homosexual practices\". Isaiah was tortured severely and exiled, while Alexander had his genitals amputated and paraded around the city on a litter to humiliate him. As a result, the Christian Emperor [[Justinian]] (c.e 482 \u2013 565) decreed that all caught for pederasty should have their genitals amputated. Many gay men were arrested in the wake of this, and died from their injuries. An atmosphere of fear followed.<ref name=\"kzSeh\" />\n\nIn [[Iberia]], the [[Visigothic]] ruler [[Egica]] of Hispania and Septimania demanded that a church council confront the occurrence of homosexuality in the kingdom. In 693, the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]] issued a canon condemning guilty clergy to degradation and exile and laymen to a hundred lashes. Egica added an edict imposing the punishment of castration (reinforcing the punishment in secular law instigated by [[King Chinawith]]).<ref name=\"WAsJ9\" /><ref name=\"o1WKL\" /><ref name=\"fone\" />\n\nThe matter was also dealt with at the Council of Paris (c.e.829) in canons 34 and 69.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> These went beyond Elvira and Ancyra in explicitly endorsing the death penalty for sodomy \u2014 claiming that it had led God to destroy [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and send the [[Noah's Flood|Great Flood]]<ref name=\"fMOKc\" /><ref group=\"note\" name=\"5vRxF\" /><ref name=\"bmqs2\" /> The concern at Paris was that toleration of sodomy might provoke God to give victory to the enemies of Christianity (with particular concerns about the growth of Islam at this time). At about the same time, the set of (forged) [[capitularies]] produced by the deacon [[Benedict Levita]] implied that [[Charlemagne]] had likewise supported the death penalty.  Finally, canon 15 of the Council of Trolsy (AD 909) warned against \"pollution with men or animals\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nAlongside this, penances for such sexual transgressions may increasingly be found in a few of the penitential books which first emerged in the 6th century in monastic communities in Ireland (including for women having sex with other women).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /><ref name=\"954jw\" />\n\n==Medieval and Early Modern period==\nBy the late Middle Ages, the term \"sodomy\" had come to cover copulation between males, bestiality, non-vaginal heterosexual intercourse,<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /> [[coitus interruptus]], masturbation, [[fellatio]] and anal sex (whether heterosexual or homosexual);<ref name=\"Perez\" /> and it increasingly began to be identified as the most heinous of sins by authorities of the Catholic Church. In Italy, [[Dominican order|Dominican]] friars would encourage the pious to \"hunt out\" sodomites and hand them to the Inquisition to be dealt with accordingly: \"These clerical discourses provided a language for secular authorities to condemn sodomy... By persecuting sodomites as well as heretics, the Church strengthened its authority and credibility as a moral arbiter\".<ref name=\"S42Zt\" />\n\n[[Pope Leo IX]] labeled homosexuality  in the 11th century as \"filthy,\" an \"execrable vice,\" and \"obscene.\"<ref name=\"Pierre J. Payer 1982 p. 29\" /> Likewise around 1051, [[Saint Peter Damian|Peter Damian]] penned the ''[[Liber Gomorrhianus]]'' in which he argued for stricter ecclesiastical punishment for clerics guilty of \"sins against nature\".<ref name=\"Pierre J. Payer 1982 p. 29\" /><ref name=\"WWvhV\" />\n\nKlaits writes: \"From the twelfth century on, outsiders came under increasing verbal and physical attack from churchmen, allied secular authorities, and, particularly in the case of Jews, from the lower strata of the population\"; and among \"outsiders\" Jews, heretics, homosexuals, and magicians were among the most significant.<ref name=\"hris8\" />\n\nThe [[Council of London in 1102]], called at the urging of English Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], explicitly denounced homosexual behavior as a sin for the first time at an English council.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\" /> Anselm felt that sodomy was widespread and not condemned strongly enough or regarded with the seriousness that it should have. Confessors were urged to take account of such ignorance when hearing confessions, but take into account mitigating factors such as age and marital status before prescribing penance; and counselling was generally preferred to punishment. In Canons 28 and 29 the Council decreed that the people should be informed of the gravity of the sin, and their obligation to confess (particularly if they derived pleasure from it). Nevertheless, Anselm deferred publication of the proceedings, arguing further time was needed to clarify certain matters.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\" /> Boswell argues the decrees were never published at all.<ref name=\"YGQ6z\" />\n\nIn 1179, [[Pope Alexander III]] presided over the [[Third Lateran Council]] in Rome which decreed (canon 11) that all those guilty of sodomy be removed from office or confined to penitential life in a monastery, if clergy; and be strictly [[excommunicated]], if laity: \"Let all who are found guilty of that unnatural vice for which the wrath of God came down upon the sons of disobedience and destroyed the five cities with fire, if they are clerics be expelled from the clergy or confined in monasteries to do penance; if they are laymen they are to incur excommunication and be completely separated from the society of the faithful.\"<ref name=\"0derD\" /> The French theologian [[Alain de Lille]] complained in 1202 that \"''such a great body of foul men roam and riot along the breadth of the whole earth''\", spreading perversion and impurity with \"monstrous acts\" endangering the wider community.<ref name=\"NTRRw\" />\n\nAt the same time, the German Abbess [[Hildegard of Bingen]] in her ''Liber divinorum operum'' described homosexuality as the \"supreme offence against God.\"<ref name=\"PfCkY\" />  In her book ''[[Scivias]]'', she describes a vision of God, and quotes him condemning homosexual acts, saying \"A man who sins with another man as if with a woman sins bitterly against God\" and therefore is \"guilty of death.\"<ref name=\"RXCYv\" />\n\nCanon 14 of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 stated that if a priest suspended for unchastity of any kind \u2014 especially the vice that \"on account of which the anger of God came from heaven upon the children of unbelief\" (sodomy) \u2014 dared to celebrate Mass then he was to be deposed permanently from the priesthood.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Zc6s2\" /><ref name=\"13zEW\" />\n\nBy the early 13th century (time of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]) the Church determined that \"secular authorities, as well as clergy, should be allowed to impose penalties on 'sodomites' for having had sexual relations\", and by the end of this period, \"Sodomites were now [regarded as] demons as well as sinners.\"<ref name=\"r7RkP\" /> Civil authorities were in parallel trying the crime of sodomy in their own courts, although in practice applying even more severe punishments (Roman civil law, for example, had prescribed death by burning for those found guilty of sodomy).<ref name=\"SBS\" />\n\nAround 1230, [[Pope Gregory IX]] argued that sodomites were \"abominable persons despised by the world... more unclean than animals\".<ref name=\"fone\" />{{rp|139}}\n\n===Thomas Aquinas===\n\nIn the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated that \"the unnatural vice\" is the greatest of the sins of lust.<ref name=\"mNFtC\" /> In his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', traditionally dated to 1264, he argued against what he called \"the error of those who say that there is no more sin in the emission of the semen than in the ejection of other superfluous products from the body\" by saying that, after murder, which destroys an existing human being, disordinate emission of semen to the preclusion of generating a human being seems to come second.<ref name=\"C4pH6\" />\n\nAlongside this, the German Dominican [[Albertus Magnus]] described  homosexuality as a foulness that was marked by an uncontrollable frenzy as well as contagious.<ref name=\"fone\" />{{rp|137}}\n\nIn 1424, [[Bernardino of Siena]] preached for three days in Florence, Italy against homosexuality and other forms of lust, calling for sodomites to be ostracized, and these sermons alongside measures by other clergy of the time strengthened opinion against homosexuals and encouraged the authorities to increase the measures of persecution.<ref name=\"YXKUl\" />\n\n===The Inquisition and homosexuality===\n\nIn 1451, [[Pope Nicholas V]] enabled the Inquisition to prosecute men who practiced sodomy. Handed over to the civil authorities, those condemned were frequently burned in accordance with civil law.<ref name=\"SBS\" />\n\nIn 1478, with the [[Papal Bull]] ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', [[Pope Sixtus IV]] acceded to the request of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], granting them exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] thus replaced the [[Medieval Inquisition]] which had been set up under direct papal control, and transferred it in Spain to civil control. In 1482, in response to complaints by relatives of the first victims, Sixtus wrote that he had not intended his grant to be abused in that way. However, strong pressure brought to bear on him prevented him from revoking it.<ref name=\"Inquisition\" />\n\n[[File:Torquemada.jpg|thumb|[[Tomas de Torquemada]] was a prominent leader of the Spanish Inquisition. 150 sodomites were executed by burning in Spain from 1570\u20131630.]]\n\nThe Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Spain, as the Spanish Inquisition was formally known, was therefore under the control of its monarchs.<ref name=\"Inquisition\" /><ref name=\"peters\" />  The [[Dominican order|Dominicans]] became formidable through their control of that Inquisition under the direction of the friar [[Tomas de Torquemada]].<ref name=\"gmLf7\" /> At first it seems to have been reluctant to take on responsibility for trying those accused of sodomy, and the Suprema (the governing body) ruled in 1509 that such cases were for the secular courts (which already punished sodomy with death). However, in 1524 the Suprema requested papal authorisation to also prosecute sodomites. [[Pope Clement VII]] granted permission but only within the Kingdom of Aragon and on condition that trials be conducted according to the civil laws, not the standard inquisitorial procedure.<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /> The Pope refused the request of King [[Philip II of Spain]] to extend the authority of the Spanish Inquisition to conducting such trials in the rest of Spain.<ref name=\"Perez\" />\n\nWithin Aragon and its dependent territories, the number of individuals that the Spanish Inquisition tried for sodomy,<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /><ref name=\"Perez\" /> between 1570 and 1630 was over 800<ref name=\"SNxA1\" /> or nearly a thousand.<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /> Nearly all of almost 500 cases of sodomy between persons concerned the relationship [[pederasty|between an older man and an adolescent]], often by coercion, with only a few cases where the couple were consenting [[homosexual]] adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse.<ref name=\"7DyNW\" /> In Spain, those whom the Spanish Inquisition convicted and had executed \"by burning without the benefit of strangulation\" were about 150.<ref name=\"l4JQB\" /> The Inquisition was harsh to sodomizers (more so for those committing bestiality than homosexuality), but tended to restrict death by burning only to those aged over twenty-five. Minors were normally whipped and sent to the galleys. Mildness was also shown to clergy, who were always a high proportion of those arrested.<ref name=\"hYlZw\" /> In fact, conviction and execution for sodomy was easier to obtain from the civil courts in other parts of Spain than from the tribunals of the Inquisition in Aragon, and there executions for sodomy were much more numerous.<ref name=\"LBpkC\" /> After 1633, where the Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction for sodomy, it ceased treating it as requiring execution, and imposed lesser penalties in cases brought before it.<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" />\n\nThe Portuguese Inquisition was established in 1536; and in 1539 [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry]], Archbishop of Braga (later cardinal and king of Portugal) became Grand Inquisitor.

Peyrefitte asserted that Paul VI was a hypocrite who had participated in a long-term sexual relationship with a movie actor.<ref name=\"64TY9\" /><ref name=\"Observer\" /><ref name=\"7VSg0\" /> Widespread rumors identified the actor as [[Paolo Carlini]],<ref name=\"Posner\" /> who had played a small part in the [[Audrey Hepburn]] film ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953). In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peter's Square on 18 April, Montini called the charges \"horrible and slanderous insinuations\" and appealed for prayers on his behalf.

It set out the belief that gay Catholics can \"express our sexuality physically, in a unitive manner that is loving, life-giving, and life-affirming.\"<ref name=\"Statement\" /> It also seeks to \"work for the development of sexual theology leading to the reform of [the Church's] teachings and practices regarding human sexuality, and for the acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender peoples as full and equal members of the one Christ.\"<ref name=\"Statement\" />   Meetings were initially held in [[San Diego]] and [[Los Angeles]], before the organization ultimately became headquartered in [[Boston]]. It later spread to [[Canada]].\n\n====1970s====\n\nFollowing the US Bishops\u2019 1976 Call To Action conference in [[Detroit]], a group called [[Call to Action]] (CTA) was established to advocate a variety of changes in the [[Catholic Church]], including in the church's teaching on [[Human sexual behavior|sexual matters]] such as homosexuality. In addition to the US bishops' conference, it drew its mission from the [[Second Vatican Council]], and in particular to its challenge to lay Catholics who had tended to defer initiatives entirely to the clergy.<ref name=\"Mission\" />\n\n[[New Ways Ministry]] was set up in 1977 in the United States of America by the [[Salvatorian]] priest Robert Nugent and the School Sister of Notre Dame nun [[Jeannine Gramick]].<ref name=\"ja181\" /> This was in response to Bishop [[Francis Mugavero]] of Brooklyn who had invited them to reach out in \"new ways\" to lesbian and gay Catholics. As early as February 1976, Mugavero issued a pastoral letter entitled \"Sexuality: God's Gift,\" defending the legitimate rights of all people, including those who were gay and lesbian. He said that they had been \"subject to misunderstanding and at times unjust discrimination.\"<ref name=\"Francis Mugavero 1976, p7\" /> In addition to gay and lesbian Catholics, the letter also spoke to the widowed, adolescents, the divorced, and those having sexual relations outside of marriage, stating: \"we pledge our willingness to help you ...to try to find new ways to communicate the truth of Christ because we believe it will make you free.<ref name=\"Francis Mugavero 1976, p7\" />\n\n====1980s====\n\nIn 1980, the Association of Priests in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] honored the Chicago branch of Dignity as the organization of the year. With the publication in 1987 of \"[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]],\" which instructed bishops not to provide facilities for organizations that did not uphold official Catholic teaching on homosexuality, Catholic bishops in Atlanta, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Pensacola and Vancouver immediately excluded Dignity chapters, and \"within a few months the organization was unwelcome on church property anywhere.\"<ref name=\"John L. Allen 2000, p.203\" />\n\nIn 1981, New Ways Ministry held its first national symposium on homosexuality and the Catholic Church, but Archbishop [[James Aloysius Hickey|James Hickey]] of Washington, D.C. wrote to Catholic bishops and communities, asking them not to support the event. Despite this, more than fifty Catholic groups endorsed the program.<ref name=\"John L. Allen 2000, p.203\" />\n\n====1990s====\n\nIn 1996, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln|bishop of Lincoln]], [[Fabian Bruskewitz]], [[excommunication|excommunicated]] all members of Call to Action within his diocese. An appeal by the Nebraska Chapter was rejected by the [[Congregation for Bishops]] in 2006.<ref name=\"confirms\" /><ref name=\"cta\" />\n\nThe [[Rainbow Sash Movement]] was established in Australia in 1998 and has been active in the United States, England, and Australia. The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow-colored fabric, which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] as a symbol of sexuality.<ref name=\"justice\" /> At the appropriate time, members go up to receive [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]].<ref name=\"rainbow\" /><ref name=\"justice\" /> If denied, they return to their pew and remain standing,<ref name=\"alliance\" /> but if the Eucharist is received, then they return to their pew and kneel in the traditional way.<ref name=\"cpcsm\" />  The Catholic Church teaches that the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] is a sign of unity,<ref name=\"acbc\" /> and that it can be denied when receiving it would be seen as an act of division or a display of opposition to the Church's teaching.<ref name=\"Thavis\" />\n\nBoth Nugent and Grammick of New Ways Ministry were formally disciplined in 1999 when the Vatican imposed lifetime bans on any pastoral work involving gay people, declaring that the positions they advanced \"do not faithfully convey the clear and constant teaching of the Catholic Church\" and \"have caused confusion among the Catholic people.\"<ref name=\"Notification\" /> The move made Nugent and Gramick \"folk heroes in liberal circles,\" where official teaching was seen as outdated and lacking compassion.<ref name=\"ja181\" /> Similarly, the American bishops [[Thomas Gumbleton]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Detroit]] and Matthew Clark of [[Rochester, New York]] were criticized for their association with New Ways Ministry, and their distortion of the theological concept of the \"Primacy of Conscience\" as an alternative to the teaching of the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"lead\" />\n\n====2010s====\n\nIn 2013, members of the Rainbow Sash Movement in Illinois planned to hold a prayer service in a cathedral for legalization of same-sex marriage, an initiative that Bishop Paprocki of Springfield called blasphemous.<ref name=\"bans\" /><ref name=\"blocks\" />\n\nIn 2018, Fr. Paul Kalchik in [[Avondale, Chicago|Avondale]], Chicago burned the [[rainbow flag]], which he described as \"propaganda,\" following a prayer of exorcism.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" /> Rainbow vestments were also destroyed.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" /> The flag had originally been displayed at the altar in 1991 to welcome LGBTQ worshipers.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" /> However, Kalchik believed his predecessors at the parish had erroneously promoted the \"gay lifestyle\" and that the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic church was \"definitely a gay thing.\" Cardinal [[Blase J. Cupich]] intervened but failed to stop the burning.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Catholicism}}\n\n*[[History of Christianity and homosexuality]]\n*[[Catholic teaching on homosexuality]]\n*[[Pastoral care for gay Catholics]]\n*[[Dissent from Catholic teaching on homosexuality]]\n*[[Homosexuality and Roman Catholic priests]]\n*[[Gay bishops]]\n*[[Political activity of the Catholic Church on LGBT issues]]\n*[[List of LGBT Catholics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|refs=\n<ref name=\"4VTV9\">The literal Greek phrase is \"ou ''paidophthor\u0113seis''\", which means,\"You shall not '''corrupt''' boys.</ref>\n<ref name=\"G94q7\">Robert Grant in ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'' argues that the language in the Syriac version against homosexuality is stronger, probably because it was presented to [[Antoninus Pius]] rather than the homosexual [[Hadrian]].</ref>\n<ref name=\"5vRxF\">(However, the historian John Boswell has called the canons a forgery in [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality''] (University of Chicago Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-22606714-8}}), P. 177 arguing in fact that \"attitudes towards homosexuality grew steadily more tolerant in the early Middle Ages\").</ref>\n<ref name=\"Zc6s2\">\"That the morals and general conduct of clerics may be better let all strive to live chastely and virtuously, particularly those in sacred orders, guarding against every vice of desire, especially, so that in the sight of Almighty God they may perform their duties with a pure heart and chaste body.

If therefore anyone suspended for this reason shall presume to celebrate the divine mysteries, let him not only be deprived of his ecclesiastical benefices but for this twofold offense let him be forever deposed.\"</ref>\n}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"plague1\">{{cite podcast |url= https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/12/01/surviving-aids-crisis-gay-catholic |title= Surviving the AIDS crisis as a gay Catholic |website= Plague: Untold Stories of AIDS & the Catholic Church |publisher=[[America (magazine)|America]] |host= Michael O'Loughlin |date= December 1, 2019|accessdate= January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"journalism.nyu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/pavement/city/aids-and-the-catholic-church/index.html|title=AIDS and the Catholic Church - Pavement Pieces|access-date=7 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603202752/http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/pavement/city/aids-and-the-catholic-church/index.html|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"yLVBA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/compass/s1084257.htm|title=Compass: Sisters of Charity - ABC TV}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"plague6\">{{cite podcast |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/01/12/aids-catholic-church-and-lgbt-issues-today |title=AIDS, the Catholic Church and LGBT issues today |website= Plague: Untold Stories of AIDS & the Catholic Church |publisher= [[America (magazine)|America]]|host=Michael O'Loughlin |date= January 12, 2020|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Wj3C2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june11/vatican_05-27.html|title=Catholic Church Looks to Lead Conversation on Combating HIV/AIDS|work=PBS NewsHour}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"unaids.org\">[http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2012/april/20120411afaithbasedresponsetohiv/ UNAIDS requests Pope Benedict XVI for support in efforts to stop new HIV infections in children];

Allen 2006 p.187\" /> His most notable discourse in this regard is his fourth [[homily]] on {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26\u201327|ESV}}, where he argued that those who have sex with the same gender must do so because they are insane: \"''All of these affections then were vile, but chiefly the mad lust after males; for the soul is more the sufferer in sins, and more dishonored than the body in diseases. ... [The men] have done an insult to nature itself. And a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it, when even the women seek after these intercourses, who ought to have more shame than men.''\"<ref name=\"iF4FR\" /> He went on to describe homosexuality as a worse sin than murder.<ref name=\"6F3vj\" /> Punishment will be found in [[hell]] for such transgressors.<ref name=\"YWAAAAYAAJ 1841, p. 44-52\" /> He noted that women could also be guilty of the sin as much as men (although the former additionally disrupted the [[patriarchal]] hierarchy through such as act).\"<ref name=\"YWAAAAYAAJ 1841, p. 44-52\" /> Chrysostom believed that the male passive partner had effectively renounced his manhood and become a woman \u2013 such an individual deserved to be killed - \"driven out and stoned\".<ref name=\"Robert H. Allen 2006 p.187\" /> Chrysostom was particularly influential in shaping early Christian thought that same-sex desire was an evil that ultimately resulted in social injustice \u2013 altering the traditional interpretation of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a place of inhospitality, to one where the sexual transgressions of the Sodomites became paramount.<ref name=\"KO9kx\" />\n\n===Early Church Councils===\n\nCanon law regulating same-sex sexual activity has mainly been shaped through the decrees issued by a number of ecclesiastical councils.<ref name=\"Derrick S. Bailey 1955, p185\" /> Initially, canons against sodomy were aimed at ensuring clerical or monastic discipline, and were only widened in the medieval period to include laymen.<ref name=\"fordham.edu\" />\n\nThe early 4th-century [[Council of Elvira]] (305-306) was the first church council to deal with the issue directly, excluding from [[Holy Communion]] anyone who had sexual intercourse (''[[stuprum]]'') with a boy:<ref name=\"Elvira\" /><ref name=\"8WFYJ\" /><ref name=\"O3Zb7\" />\n\nCanons 16 and 17 of the [[Council of Ancyra]] (c.e. 314), which \"became the standard source for medieval ecclesiastical literature against homosexuality\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> imposed on \"those who have been or who are guilty of bestial lusts\" penances whose severity varies with the age and married status of the offender, allowing access to communion only at death for a married man over fifty years old (canon 16); and imposed a penance also on \"defilers of themselves with beasts, being also leprous, who have infected others [with the leprosy of this crime]\".<ref name=\"3HcIc\" />\n\nThere are examples of punishments. In the sixth century, the Greek chronicler [[John Malalas]] recorded that a certain Isaiah (the Bishop of Rhodes) and Alexander (Bishop of Diopolis), had been punished by the Prefect of Thrace for \"homosexual practices\". Isaiah was tortured severely and exiled, while Alexander had his genitals amputated and paraded around the city on a litter to humiliate him. As a result, the Christian Emperor [[Justinian]] (c.e 482 \u2013 565) decreed that all caught for pederasty should have their genitals amputated. Many gay men were arrested in the wake of this, and died from their injuries. An atmosphere of fear followed.<ref name=\"kzSeh\" />\n\nIn [[Iberia]], the [[Visigothic]] ruler [[Egica]] of Hispania and Septimania demanded that a church council confront the occurrence of homosexuality in the kingdom. In 693, the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]] issued a canon condemning guilty clergy to degradation and exile and laymen to a hundred lashes. Egica added an edict imposing the punishment of castration (reinforcing the punishment in secular law instigated by [[King Chinawith]]).<ref name=\"WAsJ9\" /><ref name=\"o1WKL\" /><ref name=\"fone\" />\n\nThe matter was also dealt with at the Council of Paris (c.e.829) in canons 34 and 69.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> These went beyond Elvira and Ancyra in explicitly endorsing the death penalty for sodomy \u2014 claiming that it had led God to destroy [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and send the [[Noah's Flood|Great Flood]]<ref name=\"fMOKc\" /><ref group=\"note\" name=\"5vRxF\" /><ref name=\"bmqs2\" /> The concern at Paris was that toleration of sodomy might provoke God to give victory to the enemies of Christianity (with particular concerns about the growth of Islam at this time). At about the same time, the set of (forged) [[capitularies]] produced by the deacon [[Benedict Levita]] implied that [[Charlemagne]] had likewise supported the death penalty.  Finally, canon 15 of the Council of Trolsy (AD 909) warned against \"pollution with men or animals\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nAlongside this, penances for such sexual transgressions may increasingly be found in a few of the penitential books which first emerged in the 6th century in monastic communities in Ireland (including for women having sex with other women).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /><ref name=\"954jw\" />\n\n==Medieval and Early Modern period==\nBy the late Middle Ages, the term \"sodomy\" had come to cover copulation between males, bestiality, non-vaginal heterosexual intercourse,<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /> [[coitus interruptus]], masturbation, [[fellatio]] and anal sex (whether heterosexual or homosexual);<ref name=\"Perez\" /> and it increasingly began to be identified as the most heinous of sins by authorities of the Catholic Church. In Italy, [[Dominican order|Dominican]] friars would encourage the pious to \"hunt out\" sodomites and hand them to the Inquisition to be dealt with accordingly: \"These clerical discourses provided a language for secular authorities to condemn sodomy... By persecuting sodomites as well as heretics, the Church strengthened its authority and credibility as a moral arbiter\".<ref name=\"S42Zt\" />\n\n[[Pope Leo IX]] labeled homosexuality  in the 11th century as \"filthy,\" an \"execrable vice,\" and \"obscene.\"<ref name=\"Pierre J. Payer 1982 p. 29\" /> Likewise around 1051, [[Saint Peter Damian|Peter Damian]] penned the ''[[Liber Gomorrhianus]]'' in which he argued for stricter ecclesiastical punishment for clerics guilty of \"sins against nature\".<ref name=\"Pierre J.

Confessors were urged to take account of such ignorance when hearing confessions, but take into account mitigating factors such as age and marital status before prescribing penance; and counselling was generally preferred to punishment. In Canons 28 and 29 the Council decreed that the people should be informed of the gravity of the sin, and their obligation to confess (particularly if they derived pleasure from it). Nevertheless, Anselm deferred publication of the proceedings, arguing further time was needed to clarify certain matters.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\" /> Boswell argues the decrees were never published at all.<ref name=\"YGQ6z\" />\n\nIn 1179, [[Pope Alexander III]] presided over the [[Third Lateran Council]] in Rome which decreed (canon 11) that all those guilty of sodomy be removed from office or confined to penitential life in a monastery, if clergy; and be strictly [[excommunicated]], if laity: \"Let all who are found guilty of that unnatural vice for which the wrath of God came down upon the sons of disobedience and destroyed the five cities with fire, if they are clerics be expelled from the clergy or confined in monasteries to do penance; if they are laymen they are to incur excommunication and be completely separated from the society of the faithful.\"<ref name=\"0derD\" /> The French theologian [[Alain de Lille]] complained in 1202 that \"''such a great body of foul men roam and riot along the breadth of the whole earth''\", spreading perversion and impurity with \"monstrous acts\" endangering the wider community.<ref name=\"NTRRw\" />\n\nAt the same time, the German Abbess [[Hildegard of Bingen]] in her ''Liber divinorum operum'' described homosexuality as the \"supreme offence against God.\"<ref name=\"PfCkY\" />  In her book ''[[Scivias]]'', she describes a vision of God, and quotes him condemning homosexual acts, saying \"A man who sins with another man as if with a woman sins bitterly against God\" and therefore is \"guilty of death.\"<ref name=\"RXCYv\" />\n\nCanon 14 of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 stated that if a priest suspended for unchastity of any kind \u2014 especially the vice that \"on account of which the anger of God came from heaven upon the children of unbelief\" (sodomy) \u2014 dared to celebrate Mass then he was to be deposed permanently from the priesthood.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Zc6s2\" /><ref name=\"13zEW\" />\n\nBy the early 13th century (time of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]) the Church determined that \"secular authorities, as well as clergy, should be allowed to impose penalties on 'sodomites' for having had sexual relations\", and by the end of this period, \"Sodomites were now [regarded as] demons as well as sinners.\"<ref name=\"r7RkP\" /> Civil authorities were in parallel trying the crime of sodomy in their own courts, although in practice applying even more severe punishments (Roman civil law, for example, had prescribed death by burning for those found guilty of sodomy).<ref name=\"SBS\" />\n\nAround 1230, [[Pope Gregory IX]] argued that sodomites were \"abominable persons despised by the world... more unclean than animals\".<ref name=\"fone\" />{{rp|139}}\n\n===Thomas Aquinas===\n\nIn the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated that \"the unnatural vice\" is the greatest of the sins of lust.<ref name=\"mNFtC\" /> In his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', traditionally dated to 1264, he argued against what he called \"the error of those who say that there is no more sin in the emission of the semen than in the ejection of other superfluous products from the body\" by saying that, after murder, which destroys an existing human being, disordinate emission of semen to the preclusion of generating a human being seems to come second.<ref name=\"C4pH6\" />\n\nAlongside this, the German Dominican [[Albertus Magnus]] described  homosexuality as a foulness that was marked by an uncontrollable frenzy as well as contagious.<ref name=\"fone\" />{{rp|137}}\n\nIn 1424, [[Bernardino of Siena]] preached for three days in Florence, Italy against homosexuality and other forms of lust, calling for sodomites to be ostracized, and these sermons alongside measures by other clergy of the time strengthened opinion against homosexuals and encouraged the authorities to increase the measures of persecution.<ref name=\"YXKUl\" />\n\n===The Inquisition and homosexuality===\n\nIn 1451, [[Pope Nicholas V]] enabled the Inquisition to prosecute men who practiced sodomy. Handed over to the civil authorities, those condemned were frequently burned in accordance with civil law.<ref name=\"SBS\" />\n\nIn 1478, with the [[Papal Bull]] ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', [[Pope Sixtus IV]] acceded to the request of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], granting them exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] thus replaced the [[Medieval Inquisition]] which had been set up under direct papal control, and transferred it in Spain to civil control. In 1482, in response to complaints by relatives of the first victims, Sixtus wrote that he had not intended his grant to be abused in that way. However, strong pressure brought to bear on him prevented him from revoking it.<ref name=\"Inquisition\" />\n\n[[File:Torquemada.jpg|thumb|[[Tomas de Torquemada]] was a prominent leader of the Spanish Inquisition. 150 sodomites were executed by burning in Spain from 1570\u20131630.]]\n\nThe Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Spain, as the Spanish Inquisition was formally known, was therefore under the control of its monarchs.<ref name=\"Inquisition\" /><ref name=\"peters\" />  The [[Dominican order|Dominicans]] became formidable through their control of that Inquisition under the direction of the friar [[Tomas de Torquemada]].<ref name=\"gmLf7\" /> At first it seems to have been reluctant to take on responsibility for trying those accused of sodomy, and the Suprema (the governing body) ruled in 1509 that such cases were for the secular courts (which already punished sodomy with death). However, in 1524 the Suprema requested papal authorisation to also prosecute sodomites. [[Pope Clement VII]] granted permission but only within the Kingdom of Aragon and on condition that trials be conducted according to the civil laws, not the standard inquisitorial procedure.<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /> The Pope refused the request of King [[Philip II of Spain]] to extend the authority of the Spanish Inquisition to conducting such trials in the rest of Spain.<ref name=\"Perez\" />\n\nWithin Aragon and its dependent territories, the number of individuals that the Spanish Inquisition tried for sodomy,<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /><ref name=\"Perez\" /> between 1570 and 1630 was over 800<ref name=\"SNxA1\" /> or nearly a thousand.<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" /> Nearly all of almost 500 cases of sodomy between persons concerned the relationship [[pederasty|between an older man and an adolescent]], often by coercion, with only a few cases where the couple were consenting [[homosexual]] adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse.<ref name=\"7DyNW\" /> In Spain, those whom the Spanish Inquisition convicted and had executed \"by burning without the benefit of strangulation\" were about 150.<ref name=\"l4JQB\" /> The Inquisition was harsh to sodomizers (more so for those committing bestiality than homosexuality), but tended to restrict death by burning only to those aged over twenty-five. Minors were normally whipped and sent to the galleys. Mildness was also shown to clergy, who were always a high proportion of those arrested.<ref name=\"hYlZw\" /> In fact, conviction and execution for sodomy was easier to obtain from the civil courts in other parts of Spain than from the tribunals of the Inquisition in Aragon, and there executions for sodomy were much more numerous.<ref name=\"LBpkC\" /> After 1633, where the Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction for sodomy, it ceased treating it as requiring execution, and imposed lesser penalties in cases brought before it.<ref name=\"HaggertyGeorge\" />\n\nThe Portuguese Inquisition was established in 1536; and in 1539 [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry]], Archbishop of Braga (later cardinal and king of Portugal) became Grand Inquisitor.

It set out the belief that gay Catholics can \"express our sexuality physically, in a unitive manner that is loving, life-giving, and life-affirming.\"<ref name=\"Statement\" /> It also seeks to \"work for the development of sexual theology leading to the reform of [the Church's] teachings and practices regarding human sexuality, and for the acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender peoples as full and equal members of the one Christ.\"<ref name=\"Statement\" />   Meetings were initially held in [[San Diego]] and [[Los Angeles]], before the organization ultimately became headquartered in [[Boston]]. It later spread to [[Canada]].\n\n====1970s====\n\nFollowing the US Bishops\u2019 1976 Call To Action conference in [[Detroit]], a group called [[Call to Action]] (CTA) was established to advocate a variety of changes in the [[Catholic Church]], including in the church's teaching on [[Human sexual behavior|sexual matters]] such as homosexuality. In addition to the US bishops' conference, it drew its mission from the [[Second Vatican Council]], and in particular to its challenge to lay Catholics who had tended to defer initiatives entirely to the clergy.<ref name=\"Mission\" />\n\n[[New Ways Ministry]] was set up in 1977 in the United States of America by the [[Salvatorian]] priest Robert Nugent and the School Sister of Notre Dame nun [[Jeannine Gramick]].<ref name=\"ja181\" /> This was in response to Bishop [[Francis Mugavero]] of Brooklyn who had invited them to reach out in \"new ways\" to lesbian and gay Catholics. As early as February 1976, Mugavero issued a pastoral letter entitled \"Sexuality: God's Gift,\" defending the legitimate rights of all people, including those who were gay and lesbian. He said that they had been \"subject to misunderstanding and at times unjust discrimination.\"<ref name=\"Francis Mugavero 1976, p7\" /> In addition to gay and lesbian Catholics, the letter also spoke to the widowed, adolescents, the divorced, and those having sexual relations outside of marriage, stating: \"we pledge our willingness to help you ...to try to find new ways to communicate the truth of Christ because we believe it will make you free.<ref name=\"Francis Mugavero 1976, p7\" />\n\n====1980s====\n\nIn 1980, the Association of Priests in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] honored the Chicago branch of Dignity as the organization of the year. With the publication in 1987 of \"[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]],\" which instructed bishops not to provide facilities for organizations that did not uphold official Catholic teaching on homosexuality, Catholic bishops in Atlanta, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Pensacola and Vancouver immediately excluded Dignity chapters, and \"within a few months the organization was unwelcome on church property anywhere.\"<ref name=\"John L. Allen 2000, p.203\" />\n\nIn 1981, New Ways Ministry held its first national symposium on homosexuality and the Catholic Church, but Archbishop [[James Aloysius Hickey|James Hickey]] of Washington, D.C. wrote to Catholic bishops and communities, asking them not to support the event. Despite this, more than fifty Catholic groups endorsed the program.<ref name=\"John L. Allen 2000, p.203\" />\n\n====1990s====\n\nIn 1996, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln|bishop of Lincoln]], [[Fabian Bruskewitz]], [[excommunication|excommunicated]] all members of Call to Action within his diocese. An appeal by the Nebraska Chapter was rejected by the [[Congregation for Bishops]] in 2006.<ref name=\"confirms\" /><ref name=\"cta\" />\n\nThe [[Rainbow Sash Movement]] was established in Australia in 1998 and has been active in the United States, England, and Australia. The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow-colored fabric, which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] as a symbol of sexuality.<ref name=\"justice\" /> At the appropriate time, members go up to receive [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]].<ref name=\"rainbow\" /><ref name=\"justice\" /> If denied, they return to their pew and remain standing,<ref name=\"alliance\" /> but if the Eucharist is received, then they return to their pew and kneel in the traditional way.<ref name=\"cpcsm\" />  The Catholic Church teaches that the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] is a sign of unity,<ref name=\"acbc\" /> and that it can be denied when receiving it would be seen as an act of division or a display of opposition to the Church's teaching.<ref name=\"Thavis\" />\n\nBoth Nugent and Grammick of New Ways Ministry were formally disciplined in 1999 when the Vatican imposed lifetime bans on any pastoral work involving gay people, declaring that the positions they advanced \"do not faithfully convey the clear and constant teaching of the Catholic Church\" and \"have caused confusion among the Catholic people.\"<ref name=\"Notification\" /> The move made Nugent and Gramick \"folk heroes in liberal circles,\" where official teaching was seen as outdated and lacking compassion.<ref name=\"ja181\" /> Similarly, the American bishops [[Thomas Gumbleton]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Detroit]] and Matthew Clark of [[Rochester, New York]] were criticized for their association with New Ways Ministry, and their distortion of the theological concept of the \"Primacy of Conscience\" as an alternative to the teaching of the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"lead\" />\n\n====2010s====\n\nIn 2013, members of the Rainbow Sash Movement in Illinois planned to hold a prayer service in a cathedral for legalization of same-sex marriage, an initiative that Bishop Paprocki of Springfield called blasphemous.<ref name=\"bans\" /><ref name=\"blocks\" />\n\nIn 2018, Fr. Paul Kalchik in [[Avondale, Chicago|Avondale]], Chicago burned the [[rainbow flag]], which he described as \"propaganda,\" following a prayer of exorcism.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" /> Rainbow vestments were also destroyed.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" /> The flag had originally been displayed at the altar in 1991 to welcome LGBTQ worshipers.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" /> However, Kalchik believed his predecessors at the parish had erroneously promoted the \"gay lifestyle\" and that the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic church was \"definitely a gay thing.\" Cardinal [[Blase J. Cupich]] intervened but failed to stop the burning.<ref name=\"Armentrout\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Catholicism}}\n\n*[[History of Christianity and homosexuality]]\n*[[Catholic teaching on homosexuality]]\n*[[Pastoral care for gay Catholics]]\n*[[Dissent from Catholic teaching on homosexuality]]\n*[[Homosexuality and Roman Catholic priests]]\n*[[Gay bishops]]\n*[[Political activity of the Catholic Church on LGBT issues]]\n*[[List of LGBT Catholics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|refs=\n<ref name=\"4VTV9\">The literal Greek phrase is \"ou ''paidophthor\u0113seis''\", which means,\"You shall not '''corrupt''' boys.</ref>\n<ref name=\"G94q7\">Robert Grant in ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'' argues that the language in the Syriac version against homosexuality is stronger, probably because it was presented to [[Antoninus Pius]] rather than the homosexual [[Hadrian]].</ref>\n<ref name=\"5vRxF\">(However, the historian John Boswell has called the canons a forgery in [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality''] (University of Chicago Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-22606714-8}}), P. 177 arguing in fact that \"attitudes towards homosexuality grew steadily more tolerant in the early Middle Ages\").</ref>\n<ref name=\"Zc6s2\">\"That the morals and general conduct of clerics may be better let all strive to live chastely and virtuously, particularly those in sacred orders, guarding against every vice of desire, especially, so that in the sight of Almighty God they may perform their duties with a pure heart and chaste body.

If therefore anyone suspended for this reason shall presume to celebrate the divine mysteries, let him not only be deprived of his ecclesiastical benefices but for this twofold offense let him be forever deposed.\"</ref>\n}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"plague1\">{{cite podcast |url= https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/12/01/surviving-aids-crisis-gay-catholic |title= Surviving the AIDS crisis as a gay Catholic |website= Plague: Untold Stories of AIDS & the Catholic Church |publisher=[[America (magazine)|America]] |host= Michael O'Loughlin |date= December 1, 2019|accessdate= January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"journalism.nyu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/pavement/city/aids-and-the-catholic-church/index.html|title=AIDS and the Catholic Church - Pavement Pieces|access-date=7 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603202752/http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/pavement/city/aids-and-the-catholic-church/index.html|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"yLVBA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/compass/s1084257.htm|title=Compass: Sisters of Charity - ABC TV}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"plague6\">{{cite podcast |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/01/12/aids-catholic-church-and-lgbt-issues-today |title=AIDS, the Catholic Church and LGBT issues today |website= Plague: Untold Stories of AIDS & the Catholic Church |publisher= [[America (magazine)|America]]|host=Michael O'Loughlin |date= January 12, 2020|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Wj3C2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june11/vatican_05-27.html|title=Catholic Church Looks to Lead Conversation on Combating HIV/AIDS|work=PBS NewsHour}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"unaids.org\">[http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2012/april/20120411afaithbasedresponsetohiv/ UNAIDS requests Pope Benedict XVI for support in efforts to stop new HIV infections in children];
