These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.\n\nThe word \"mussel\" is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family [[Mytilidae]], most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong [[Byssus|byssal threads]] (\"beard\") to a firm substrate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/mussel|title=Mussel|last=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=22 May 2009|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref> A few species (in the genus ''[[Bathymodiolus]]'') have colonised [[hydrothermal vent]]s associated with deep ocean ridges.\n\nIn most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide, being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat [[nacre]]ous.\n\nThe common name \"mussel\" is also used for many freshwater bivalves, including the [[freshwater pearl mussel]]s. Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, canals, and they are classified in a different [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of bivalves, despite some very superficial similarities in appearance.\n\nFreshwater [[zebra mussels]] and their relatives in the family [[Dreissenidae]] are not related to previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many ''Mytilus'' species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner, using a byssus. They are classified with the [[Heterodonta]], the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as \"clams\".\n\n==General anatomy==\n[[File:Miesmuscheln-2.jpg|thumb|left| Marine [[blue mussel]], ''Mytilus edulis'', showing some of the inner anatomy. The white posterior adductor muscle is visible in the upper image, and has been cut in the lower image to allow the valves to open fully.]]\n[[File:3D flight around a \u00b5CT scan of a Mytilus covered with Balanidae.ogv|thumb|300px|right|Flight around a 3D-[[3D rendering|Rendering]] of a [[Computed tomography|\u00b5CT]]-Scan of a young [[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]] that is almost completely covered with [[Balanidae]] (barnacles). Resolution of the scan is 29\u00b5m/[[Voxel]].]]\n\nThe mussel's external shell is composed of two hinged halves or \"valves\". The valves are joined together on the outside by a ligament, and are closed when necessary by strong internal muscles (anterior and posterior adductor muscles). Mussel shells carry out a variety of functions, including support for soft tissues, protection from predators and protection against desiccation.\n\n\nThe shell has three layers. In the pearly mussels there is an inner iridescent layer of [[nacre]] (mother-of-pearl) composed of [[calcium carbonate]], which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the [[periostracum]], an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called [[conchin]], and its function is to protect the prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).\n\nLike most bivalves, mussels have a large organ called a foot. In freshwater mussels, the foot is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling the rest of the animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.\n\nIn marine mussels, the foot is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is continuous with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate allowing it to remain [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] in areas of high flow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaccaro|first=Eleonora|last2=Waite|first2=J. Herbert|date=2001-09-01|title=Yield and Post-Yield Behavior of Mussel Byssal Thread: A Self-Healing Biomolecular Material|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=2|issue=3|pages=906\u2013911|doi=10.1021/bm0100514|issn=1525-7797}}</ref> The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as [[dog whelk]]s, that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.\n\nIn cooking, the byssus of the mussel is known as the \"beard\" and is removed before the mussels are prepared.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life habits==\n[[File:Mytilus with byssus.jpg|thumb|left| A ''Mytilus'' with its byssus clearly showing, at [[Ocean Beach, San Francisco, California|Ocean Beach]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]]]\n[[File:Starfishmussel.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sea star|starfish]] consuming a mussel in [[Northern California]]]]\n\n===Feeding===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[filter feeders]]; they feed on [[plankton]] and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its incurrent siphon. The water is then brought into the branchial chamber by the actions of the [[cilia]] located on the [[gill]]s for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.\n\nMarine mussels are usually found [[Sessility (zoology)|clumping]] together on wave-washed rocks, each attached to the rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against the force of the waves. At low tide mussels in the middle of a clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.\n\n===Reproduction===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]], with separate male and female individuals. In marine mussels, fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, it is capable of moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.\n\nFreshwater mussels reproduce sexually. Sperm is released by the male directly into the water and enters the female via the incurrent siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a [[glochidium]] (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish's fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the female mussel where they are constantly flushed with oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of [[aggressive mimicry]].\n\nGlochidia are generally species-specific, and will only live if they find the correct fish host. Once the larval mussels attach to the fish, the fish body reacts to cover them with cells forming a [[cyst]], where the glochidia remain for two to five weeks (depending on temperature). They grow, break free from the host, and drop to the bottom of the water to begin an independent life.\n\n===Predators===\nMarine mussels are eaten by humans, [[starfish]], seabirds, and by numerous species of [[predatory]] marine [[gastropod]]s in the family [[Muricidae]], such as the [[dog whelk]], ''Nucella lapillus''. Freshwater mussels are eaten by muskrats, otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans, and geese. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Mussels on rock.JPG|thumb|160px|Mussels completely covering rocks in [[intertidal zone]], in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]]]\nMarine mussels are abundant in the low and mid intertidal zone in temperate seas globally.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other species of marine mussel live in tropical intertidal areas, but not in the same huge numbers as in temperate zones.\n\nCertain species of marine mussels prefer salt marshes or quiet bays, while others thrive in pounding surf, completely covering wave-washed rocks. Some species have colonized abyssal depths near [[hydrothermal vents]]. The South African white mussel exceptionally does not bind itself to rocks but burrows into sandy beaches extending two tubes above the sand surface for ingestion of food and water and exhausting wastes.\n\nFreshwater mussels inhabit permanent lakes, rivers, canals and streams throughout the world except in the polar regions. They require a constant source of cool, clean water. They prefer water with a substantial mineral content, using calcium carbonate to build their shells.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aquaculture==\n[[File:Mussel dredgers at Carlingford harbour - geograph.org.uk - 174327.jpg|thumb|right|Mussel [[Fishing dredge|dredgers]]]]\n[[File:Bouchots DSC04101.jpg|thumb|75px|right|''Bouchots'' are marine pilings for growing mussels, here shown at an agricultural fair.]]\n[[File:Abucay,Bataanjf3721 06.JPG|thumb|right|125px|[[Bamboo]] is used for mussel breeding and propagation ([[Abucay, Bataan]], [[Philippines]]).]]\nIn 2005, China accounted for 40% of the global mussel catch according to a [[FAO]] study.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/SQServlet?file=/usr/local/tomcat/FI/5.5.23/figis/webapps/figis/temp/hqp_30371.xml&outtype=html China catches 0.77m tonnes of mussels in 2005]</ref> Within Europe, where mussels have been cultivated for centuries, Spain remained the industry leader.

Some species of marine mussel, including the [[Blue mussel]] (''Mytilus edulis'') and the [[New Zealand green-lipped mussel]] (''Perna canaliculus''), are also cultivated as a source of food.\n\nIn some areas of the world, mussel farmers collect naturally occurring marine mussel seed for transfer to more appropriate growing areas, however, most North American mussel farmers rely on hatchery-produced seed.<ref name=\"BC\" /> Growers typically purchase seed after it has set (about 1mm in size) or after it has been nursed in upwellers for 3-6 additional weeks and is 2-3mm.<ref name=\"BC\" /> The seed is then typically reared in a nursery environment, where it is transferred to a material with a suitable surface for later relocation to the growing area. After about three months in the nursery, mussel seed is \"socked\" (placed in a tube-like mesh material) and hung on longlines or rafts for grow-out. Within a few days, the mussels migrate to the outside of the sock for better access food sources in the water column. Mussels grow quickly and are usually ready for harvest in less than two years. Unlike other cultured bivalves, mussels use byssus threads (beard) to attach themselves to any firm substrate, which makes them suitable for a number of culture methods.\n\nThere are a variety of techniques for growing mussels.\n\n* '''Bouchot culture:''' Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, known in French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, on which the mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting prevents the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.\n* '''On-bottom culture:''' On-bottom culture is based on the principle of transferring mussel seed (spat) from areas where they have settled naturally to areas where they can be placed in lower densities to increase growth rates, facilitate harvest, and control predation (Mussel farmers must remove predators and macroalgae during the growth cycle).<ref name=\"Mytilus\">{{cite web|title=Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme, Mytilus edulis|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Mytilus_edulis/en|publisher=FAO}}</ref>\n* '''Raft culture:''' Raft culture is a commonly used method throughout the world. Lines of rope mesh socks are seeded with young mussels and suspended vertically from a raft. The specific length of the socks depends on depth and food availability.\n* '''Longline culture (rope culture):''' Mussels are cultivated extensively in New Zealand, where the most common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are hung from a rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats. The most common species cultivated in New Zealand is the New Zealand green-lipped mussel. Longline culture is the most recent development for mussel culture<ref name=\"Mytilus\" /> and are often used as an alternative to raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.\n\n===Harvest===\nIn roughly 12\u201315 months, mussels reach marketable size (40mm) and are ready for harvest. Harvesting methods depend on the grow-out area and the rearing method being used. Dredges are currently used for on-bottom culture. Mussels grown on wooden poles can be harvested by hand or with a hydraulic powered system. For raft and longline culture, a platform is typically lowered under the mussel lines, which are then cut from the system and brought to the surface and dumped into containers on a nearby vessel. After harvest, mussels are typically placed in seawater tanks to rid them of impurities before marketing.\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay3.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning mussels in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\n\n==Medical==\nByssal threads, used to anchor mussels to substrates, are now recognized as superior bonding agents.

In the USA during the Second World War, mussels were commonly served in diners and eateries across the country. This was due to the lack of access to red meat (such as beef and pork) for the general public, in relation to the aspect of the American [[wartime rationing]] policy concerning food, with much of the meat available being sent to aid the US military's war efforts abroad. Instead, mussels became a popular substitute for most meats (with the exception of chicken).<ref>Alton Brown, ''Good Eats,''</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, mussels are consumed with [[French fries]] (\"mosselen met friet\" or \"[[moules-frites]]\") or bread. In Belgium, mussels are sometimes served with fresh herbs and flavorful vegetables in a stock of butter and white wine. [[French fries|Fries]] and [[Belgian beer]] sometimes are accompaniments. In the Netherlands, mussels are sometimes served fried in batter or [[breading|breadcrumbs]], particularly at [[take-out]] food outlets or informal settings. In France, the [[\u00c9clade des Moules#Charente-Maritime|\u00c9clade des Moules]], or, locally, Terr\u00e9 de Moules, is a mussel bake that can be found along the beaches of the [[Bay of Biscay]].\n\nIn Italy, mussels are mixed with other sea food, they are consumed often steam cooked (most popular), sometimes with white wine, herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. In Spain, they are consumed mostly steam cooked, sometimes boiling white wine, onion and herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. They can also be eaten as \"tigres\", a sort of [[croquette]] using the mussel meat, shrimps and other pieces of fish in a thick bechamel then breaded and fried in the clean mussel shell. They are used in other sort of dishes such as rices or soups or commonly eaten canned in a [[pickling]] brine made of oil, vinegar, peppercorns, bay leaves and paprika.\n\nIn Turkey, mussels are either covered with flour and fried on shishs ('midye tava'), or filled with rice and served cold ('midye dolma') and are usually consumed after alcohol (mostly [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|raki]] or beer).\n\nThey are used in Ireland boiled and seasoned with vinegar, with the \"bray\" or boiling water as a supplementary hot drink.\n\nIn [[Cantonese cuisine]], mussels are cooked in a broth of garlic and fermented black bean. In New Zealand, they are served in a chilli or garlic-based [[vinaigrette]], processed into fritters and fried, or used as the base for a chowder.\n\nIn Brasil, it is common to see mussels being cooked and served with olive oil, usually accompanied by onion, garlic and other herbs. The plate is very popular among tourists and low classes, probably because of the hot climate that favours mussels reproduction.\n\nIn India, mussels are popular in [[Kerala]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]]-[[Bhatkal]], and [[Goa]]. They are either prepared with [[Moringa oleifera|drumsticks]], [[breadfruit]] or other vegetables, or filled with rice and coconut paste with spices and served hot. Fried mussels ('Kadukka' \u0d15\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 in [[Malayalam]]) of north Kerala especially in [[Thalassery]] are a spicy, favored delicacy.\nIn coastal [[Karnataka]] [[Beary]]'s prepare special rice ball stuffed with spicy fried mussels and steamed  locally known  as \"pachilede pindi\".\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Moules frites wth rose and pastis.JPG|thumb|300px|Moules frites]]\n[[File:Mussel dish.jpg|thumb|A mussel dish with cherry tomatoes and croutons]]\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay1.jpg|thumb|right|Simple mussels roasting in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\nMussels can be smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued or fried in butter or vegetable oil. As with all [[shellfish]], except shrimp, mussels should be checked to ensure they are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them unpalatable or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002851|Poisoning - fish and shellfish}}</ref> A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded. Unusually heavy, wild-caught, closed mussels may be discarded as they may contain only mud or sand. (They can be tested by slightly opening the shell halves.) A thorough rinse in water and removal of \"the beard\" is suggested. Mussel shells usually open when cooked, revealing the cooked soft parts. Historically, it has been believed that after cooking all the mussels should have opened and those that have not are not safe to eat and should be discarded. However, according to marine biologist Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook's advice, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish. Ruello found 11.5% of all mussels failed to open during cooking, but when forced open, 100% were \"both adequately cooked and safe to eat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/29/2404364.htm |title=Mussel myth an open and shut case |publisher=ABC Science |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2015-08-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough mussels are valued as food, mussel poisoning due to toxic planktonic organisms can be a danger along some coastlines. For instance, mussels should be avoided along the west coast of the United States during the warmer months. This poisoning is usually due to a bloom of [[dinoflagellate]]s (red tides), which contain toxins. The dinoflagellates and their toxin are harmless to mussels, even when concentrated by the mussel's filter feeding, but if the mussels are consumed by humans, the concentrated toxins cause serious illness, such as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]].

These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.\n\nThe word \"mussel\" is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family [[Mytilidae]], most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong [[Byssus|byssal threads]] (\"beard\") to a firm substrate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/mussel|title=Mussel|last=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=22 May 2009|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref> A few species (in the genus ''[[Bathymodiolus]]'') have colonised [[hydrothermal vent]]s associated with deep ocean ridges.\n\nIn most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide, being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat [[nacre]]ous.\n\nThe common name \"mussel\" is also used for many freshwater bivalves, including the [[freshwater pearl mussel]]s. Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, canals, and they are classified in a different [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of bivalves, despite some very superficial similarities in appearance.\n\nFreshwater [[zebra mussels]] and their relatives in the family [[Dreissenidae]] are not related to previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many ''Mytilus'' species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner, using a byssus. They are classified with the [[Heterodonta]], the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as \"clams\".\n\n==General anatomy==\n[[File:Miesmuscheln-2.jpg|thumb|left| Marine [[blue mussel]], ''[[Mytilus edulis]]'', showing some of the inner anatomy.

Resolution of the scan is 29\u00b5m/[[Voxel]].]]\n\nThe mussel's external shell is composed of two hinged halves or \"valves\". The valves are joined together on the outside by a ligament, and are closed when necessary by strong internal muscles (anterior and posterior adductor muscles). Mussel shells carry out a variety of functions, including support for soft tissues, protection from predators and protection against desiccation.\n\n\nThe shell has three layers. In the pearly mussels there is an inner iridescent layer of [[nacre]] (mother-of-pearl) composed of [[calcium carbonate]], which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the [[periostracum]], an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called [[conchin]], and its function is to protect the prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).\n\nLike most bivalves, mussels have a large organ called a foot. In freshwater mussels, the foot is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling the rest of the animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.\n\nIn marine mussels, the foot is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is continuous with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate allowing it to remain [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] in areas of high flow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaccaro|first=Eleonora|last2=Waite|first2=J.

A mussel draws water in through its incurrent siphon. The water is then brought into the branchial chamber by the actions of the [[cilia]] located on the [[gill]]s for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.\n\nMarine mussels are usually found [[Sessility (zoology)|clumping]] together on wave-washed rocks, each attached to the rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against the force of the waves. At low tide mussels in the middle of a clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.\n\n===Reproduction===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]], with separate male and female individuals. In marine mussels, fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, it is capable of moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.\n\nFreshwater mussels reproduce sexually. Sperm is released by the male directly into the water and enters the female via the incurrent siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a [[glochidium]] (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish's fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the female mussel where they are constantly flushed with oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of [[aggressive mimicry]].\n\nGlochidia are generally species-specific, and will only live if they find the correct fish host. Once the larval mussels attach to the fish, the fish body reacts to cover them with cells forming a [[cyst]], where the glochidia remain for two to five weeks (depending on temperature). They grow, break free from the host, and drop to the bottom of the water to begin an independent life.\n\n===Predators===\nMarine mussels are eaten by humans, [[starfish]], seabirds, and by numerous species of [[predatory]] marine [[gastropod]]s in the family [[Muricidae]], such as the [[dog whelk]], ''Nucella lapillus''. Freshwater mussels are eaten by muskrats, otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans, and geese. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Mussels on rock.JPG|thumb|160px|Mussels completely covering rocks in [[intertidal zone]], in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]]]\nMarine mussels are abundant in the low and mid intertidal zone in temperate seas globally.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other species of marine mussel live in tropical intertidal areas, but not in the same huge numbers as in temperate zones.\n\nCertain species of marine mussels prefer salt marshes or quiet bays, while others thrive in pounding surf, completely covering wave-washed rocks. Some species have colonized abyssal depths near [[hydrothermal vents]]. The South African white mussel exceptionally does not bind itself to rocks but burrows into sandy beaches extending two tubes above the sand surface for ingestion of food and water and exhausting wastes.\n\nFreshwater mussels inhabit permanent lakes, rivers, canals and streams throughout the world except in the polar regions. They require a constant source of cool, clean water. They prefer water with a substantial mineral content, using calcium carbonate to build their shells.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aquaculture==\n[[File:Mussel dredgers at Carlingford harbour - geograph.org.uk - 174327.jpg|thumb|right|Mussel [[Fishing dredge|dredgers]]]]\n[[File:Bouchots DSC04101.jpg|thumb|75px|right|''Bouchots'' are marine pilings for growing mussels, here shown at an agricultural fair.]]\n[[File:Abucay,Bataanjf3721 06.JPG|thumb|right|125px|[[Bamboo]] is used for mussel breeding and propagation ([[Abucay, Bataan]], [[Philippines]]).]]\nIn 2005, China accounted for 40% of the global mussel catch according to a [[FAO]] study.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/SQServlet?file=/usr/local/tomcat/FI/5.5.23/figis/webapps/figis/temp/hqp_30371.xml&outtype=html China catches 0.77m tonnes of mussels in 2005]</ref> Within Europe, where mussels have been cultivated for centuries, Spain remained the industry leader.

Some species of marine mussel, including the [[Blue mussel]] (''Mytilus edulis'') and the [[New Zealand green-lipped mussel]] (''Perna canaliculus''), are also cultivated as a source of food.\n\nIn some areas of the world, mussel farmers collect naturally occurring marine mussel seed for transfer to more appropriate growing areas, however, most North American mussel farmers rely on hatchery-produced seed.<ref name=\"BC\" /> Growers typically purchase seed after it has set (about 1mm in size) or after it has been nursed in upwellers for 3-6 additional weeks and is 2-3mm.<ref name=\"BC\" /> The seed is then typically reared in a nursery environment, where it is transferred to a material with a suitable surface for later relocation to the growing area. After about three months in the nursery, mussel seed is \"socked\" (placed in a tube-like mesh material) and hung on longlines or rafts for grow-out. Within a few days, the mussels migrate to the outside of the sock for better access food sources in the water column. Mussels grow quickly and are usually ready for harvest in less than two years. Unlike other cultured bivalves, mussels use byssus threads (beard) to attach themselves to any firm substrate, which makes them suitable for a number of culture methods.\n\nThere are a variety of techniques for growing mussels.\n\n* '''Bouchot culture:''' Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, known in French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, on which the mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting prevents the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.\n* '''On-bottom culture:''' On-bottom culture is based on the principle of transferring mussel seed (spat) from areas where they have settled naturally to areas where they can be placed in lower densities to increase growth rates, facilitate harvest, and control predation (Mussel farmers must remove predators and macroalgae during the growth cycle).<ref name=\"Mytilus\">{{cite web|title=Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme, Mytilus edulis|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Mytilus_edulis/en|publisher=FAO}}</ref>\n* '''Raft culture:''' Raft culture is a commonly used method throughout the world. Lines of rope mesh socks are seeded with young mussels and suspended vertically from a raft. The specific length of the socks depends on depth and food availability.\n* '''Longline culture (rope culture):''' Mussels are cultivated extensively in New Zealand, where the most common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are hung from a rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats. The most common species cultivated in New Zealand is the New Zealand green-lipped mussel. Longline culture is the most recent development for mussel culture<ref name=\"Mytilus\" /> and are often used as an alternative to raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.\n\n===Harvest===\nIn roughly 12\u201315 months, mussels reach marketable size (40mm) and are ready for harvest. Harvesting methods depend on the grow-out area and the rearing method being used. Dredges are currently used for on-bottom culture. Mussels grown on wooden poles can be harvested by hand or with a hydraulic powered system. For raft and longline culture, a platform is typically lowered under the mussel lines, which are then cut from the system and brought to the surface and dumped into containers on a nearby vessel. After harvest, mussels are typically placed in seawater tanks to rid them of impurities before marketing.\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay3.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning mussels in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\n\n==Medical==\nByssal threads, used to anchor mussels to substrates, are now recognized as superior bonding agents.

In the USA during the Second World War, mussels were commonly served in diners and eateries across the country. This was due to the lack of access to red meat (such as beef and pork) for the general public, in relation to the aspect of the American [[wartime rationing]] policy concerning food, with much of the meat available being sent to aid the US military's war efforts abroad. Instead, mussels became a popular substitute for most meats (with the exception of chicken).<ref>Alton Brown, ''Good Eats,''</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, mussels are consumed with [[French fries]] (\"mosselen met friet\" or \"[[moules-frites]]\") or bread. In Belgium, mussels are sometimes served with fresh herbs and flavorful vegetables in a stock of butter and white wine. [[French fries|Fries]] and [[Belgian beer]] sometimes are accompaniments. In the Netherlands, mussels are sometimes served fried in batter or [[breading|breadcrumbs]], particularly at [[take-out]] food outlets or informal settings. In France, the [[\u00c9clade des Moules#Charente-Maritime|\u00c9clade des Moules]], or, locally, Terr\u00e9 de Moules, is a mussel bake that can be found along the beaches of the [[Bay of Biscay]].\n\nIn Italy, mussels are mixed with other sea food, they are consumed often steam cooked (most popular), sometimes with white wine, herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. In Spain, they are consumed mostly steam cooked, sometimes boiling white wine, onion and herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. They can also be eaten as \"tigres\", a sort of [[croquette]] using the mussel meat, shrimps and other pieces of fish in a thick bechamel then breaded and fried in the clean mussel shell. They are used in other sort of dishes such as rices or soups or commonly eaten canned in a [[pickling]] brine made of oil, vinegar, peppercorns, bay leaves and paprika.\n\nIn Turkey, mussels are either covered with flour and fried on shishs ('midye tava'), or filled with rice and served cold ('midye dolma') and are usually consumed after alcohol (mostly [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|raki]] or beer).\n\nThey are used in Ireland boiled and seasoned with vinegar, with the \"bray\" or boiling water as a supplementary hot drink.\n\nIn [[Cantonese cuisine]], mussels are cooked in a broth of garlic and fermented black bean. In New Zealand, they are served in a chilli or garlic-based [[vinaigrette]], processed into fritters and fried, or used as the base for a chowder.\n\nIn Brasil, it is common to see mussels being cooked and served with olive oil, usually accompanied by onion, garlic and other herbs. The plate is very popular among tourists and low classes, probably because of the hot climate that favours mussels reproduction.\n\nIn India, mussels are popular in [[Kerala]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]]-[[Bhatkal]], and [[Goa]]. They are either prepared with [[Moringa oleifera|drumsticks]], [[breadfruit]] or other vegetables, or filled with rice and coconut paste with spices and served hot. Fried mussels ('Kadukka' \u0d15\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 in [[Malayalam]]) of north Kerala especially in [[Thalassery]] are a spicy, favored delicacy.\nIn coastal [[Karnataka]] [[Beary]]'s prepare special rice ball stuffed with spicy fried mussels and steamed  locally known  as \"pachilede pindi\".\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Moules frites wth rose and pastis.JPG|thumb|300px|Moules frites]]\n[[File:Mussel dish.jpg|thumb|A mussel dish with cherry tomatoes and croutons]]\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay1.jpg|thumb|right|Simple mussels roasting in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\nMussels can be smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued or fried in butter or vegetable oil. As with all [[shellfish]], except shrimp, mussels should be checked to ensure they are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them unpalatable or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002851|Poisoning - fish and shellfish}}</ref> A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded. Unusually heavy, wild-caught, closed mussels may be discarded as they may contain only mud or sand. (They can be tested by slightly opening the shell halves.) A thorough rinse in water and removal of \"the beard\" is suggested. Mussel shells usually open when cooked, revealing the cooked soft parts. Historically, it has been believed that after cooking all the mussels should have opened and those that have not are not safe to eat and should be discarded. However, according to marine biologist Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook's advice, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish. Ruello found 11.5% of all mussels failed to open during cooking, but when forced open, 100% were \"both adequately cooked and safe to eat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/29/2404364.htm |title=Mussel myth an open and shut case |publisher=ABC Science |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2015-08-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough mussels are valued as food, mussel poisoning due to toxic planktonic organisms can be a danger along some coastlines. For instance, mussels should be avoided along the west coast of the United States during the warmer months. This poisoning is usually due to a bloom of [[dinoflagellate]]s (red tides), which contain toxins. The dinoflagellates and their toxin are harmless to mussels, even when concentrated by the mussel's filter feeding, but if the mussels are consumed by humans, the concentrated toxins cause serious illness, such as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]].

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

He scored 160 goals in 658 league and cup games in an 18-year professional career.\n\nStarting out at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], he turned professional with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1980. Five years later, following a loan spell with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], he signed with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He spent four seasons with Preston, then spent one season at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before transferring to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1990. After a six-year spell with the club he moved on to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], and finally [[Slough Town F.C.|Slough Town]]. He helped Sheffield United to win promotion out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1983\u201384, and was named as Preston North End's Player of the Year in 1987, having helped the club to win promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1986\u201387.\n\nHe went into coaching in 1999, and spent two periods as manager of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and three spells as a caretaker manager at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], where he was appointed academy manager in 2014.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Sheffield United===\nHaving joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] straight from school in 1979, Brazil stayed with Palace for just twelve months before taking the opportunity of first team football with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], signing on a free transfer in August 1980.<ref name=\"toon1892.com\">{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Kenneth H|title=Player Details {{!}}  Gary  Nicholas  Brazil {{!}} toon1892|url=http://toon1892.com/detail_player.php?id=97|website=toon1892.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> In nearly five years at [[Bramall Lane]] he played 78 games, of which 30 were as a substitute, scoring 10 goals.

He scored 160 goals in 658 league and cup games in an 18-year professional career.\n\nStarting out at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], he turned professional with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1980. Five years later, following a loan spell with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], he signed with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He spent four seasons with Preston, then spent one season at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before transferring to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1990. After a six-year spell with the club he moved on to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], and finally [[Slough Town F.C.|Slough Town]]. He helped Sheffield United to win promotion out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1983\u201384, and was named as Preston North End's Player of the Year in 1987, having helped the club to win promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1986\u201387.\n\nHe went into coaching in 1999, and spent two periods as manager of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and three spells as a caretaker manager at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], where he was appointed academy manager in 2014.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Sheffield United===\nHaving joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] straight from school in 1979, Brazil stayed with Palace for just twelve months before taking the opportunity of first team football with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], signing on a free transfer in August 1980.<ref name=\"toon1892.com\">{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Kenneth H|title=Player Details {{!}}  Gary  Nicholas  Brazil {{!}} toon1892|url=http://toon1892.com/detail_player.php?id=97|website=toon1892.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> In nearly five years at [[Bramall Lane]] he played 78 games, of which 30 were as a substitute, scoring 10 goals.

After [[Ian Porterfield]] took charge, they then made an immediate return as champions of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]]. A mid-table finish in [[1982\u201383 Football League|1982\u201383]] followed, before a second promotion in three years was achieved with a third-place finish in [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384]], though they had only finished ahead of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on goals scored.<ref name=\"Ellis\">{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Adam|title=Where Are They Now?

A promotion push in [[1988\u201389 Football League|1988\u201389]] ended in defeat to former club Port Vale in the play-off semi-finals. However Brazil had already departed, having been picked up by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a fee of \u00a3200,000 (of which half was made up in a swap deal with [[Ian Bogie]]) in February 1989.<ref name=\"toon1892.com\"/> In all competitions he had played 202 games for Preston, scoring 72 goals.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nHe started just three games of the rest of [[1988\u201389 Newcastle United F.C. season|the season]], as Newcastle suffered relegation out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

In September 1990, he moved on to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for a fee of \u00a3110,000.<ref name=\"toon1892.com\"/> In six seasons at [[Craven Cottage]] Brazil played 254 matches and scored 60 goals. He hit five goals in [[1990\u201391 Fulham F.C. season|1990\u201391]], as the \"Cottagers\" almost exited the Third Division at the wrong end under the stewardship of [[Alan Dicks]]. Brazil finished as the [[List of Fulham F.C. seasons|club's top scorer]] in [[1991\u201392 Football League|1991\u201392]] with 14 goals, as the club missed out on the play-offs by three places and four points. Following an indifferent [[1992\u201393 Football League|1992\u201393]] campaign, he finished as the club's top scorer again in [[1993\u201394 Fulham F.C. season|1993\u201394]] with 14 goals; however his scoring record was not enough to prevent the club slipping into the bottom tier under [[Don Mackay]]. An unsuccessful promotion campaign followed in [[1994\u201395 Fulham F.C. season|1994\u201395]] under [[Ian Branfoot]]'s stewardship, with Fulham finishing two places and three points outside the play-offs.\n\n===Later career===\nUpon leaving Fulham in at the end of [[1995\u201396 Football League|1995\u201396]] he had spells at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], also of the Third Division.<ref name=\"toon1892.com\"/> Fulham would finally win promotion out of the division in [[1996\u201397 Football League|1996\u201397]] under new boss [[Micky Adams]].

More broadly, the Liberal Party's ideological ancestry stretched back to the anti-Labor groupings in the first Commonwealth parliaments. The [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] was a fusion of the [[Free Trade Party]] and the [[Protectionist Party]] in 1909 by the second prime minister, [[Alfred Deakin]], in response to [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]'s growing electoral prominence. The Commonwealth Liberal Party merged with several Labor dissidents (including [[Billy Hughes]]) to form the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917. That party, in turn, merged with Labor dissidents to form the UAP in 1931.\n\nThe UAP had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector [[Joseph Lyons]] as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the [[Great Depression]] had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/before-office.aspx |title=Before office\u2014Joseph Lyons\u2014Australia's PMs\u2014Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the [[Lyons Government]] went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian pump-priming]] and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw [[Robert Menzies]] assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as [[Menzies Government (1939\u20131941)|Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941]] but resigned as leader of the minority [[World War II]] government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the [[1943 Australian federal election|1943 election]].  In New South Wales, the party merged with the [[Commonwealth Party (New South Wales)|Commonwealth Party]] to form the [[Democratic Party (1943)|Democratic Party]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/17869825|title=\"Democratic Party\" Formed|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=25 November 1943|accessdate=29 November 2019}}</ref> In Queensland [[United Australia Party \u2013 Queensland|the state party]] was absorbed into the [[Queensland People's Party]].<ref>John Laverty, 'Chandler, Sir John Beals (1887\u20131962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chandler-sir-john-beals-9724/text17171, published first in hardcopy 1993.

The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with control of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].

External Affairs Minister [[Percy Spender]] had put forward the proposal to work along similar lines to the NATO Alliance. The Treaty declared that any attack on one of the three parties in the Pacific area would be viewed as a threat to each, and that the common danger would be met in accordance with each nation's constitutional processes. In 1954, the Menzies Government signed the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty ([[SEATO]]) as a South East Asian counterpart to NATO.

The Australian economy was facing the [[early 1990s recession]]. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr [[John Hewson]], in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page [[Fightback! (policy)|Fightback!]] policy document\u2014a radical collection of [[Neoliberalism|\"dry\"]], [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] measures including the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), various changes to [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] including the abolition of [[bulk billing]] for non-[[Social security|concession holders]], the introduction of a nine-month limit on [[unemployment benefits]], various changes to [[industrial relations]] including the abolition of [[Industrial award|awards]], a $13&nbsp;billion personal [[income tax]] cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10&nbsp;billion in [[government spending]] cuts, the abolition of state [[payroll tax]]es and the [[privatisation]] of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the [[keynesian]] [[economic policies]] practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the [[tax burden]] from [[direct taxation]] of the wealthy to [[indirect taxation]] as a broad-based [[consumption tax]]. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST\u2014leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous [[birthday cake interview]], considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the [[1993 Australian federal election|1993 election]]. A number of the proposals were later adopted into law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the [[John Howard|Howard]] Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the [[Tony Abbott|Abbott]] Liberal government.\n\nAt the state level, the Liberals have been dominant for long periods in all states except Queensland, where they have always held fewer seats than the [[National Party of Australia|National party]] (not to be confused with the old Nationalist Party). The Liberals were in power in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] from 1955 to 1982. [[Jeff Kennett]] led the party back to office in that state in 1992, and remained Premier until 1999.\n\nIn South Australia, initially a Liberal and Country Party affiliated party, the [[Liberal and Country League]] (LCL), mostly led by [[Premier of South Australia]] [[Tom Playford]], was in power from the [[1933 South Australian state election|1933 election]] to the [[1965 South Australian state election|1965 election]], though with assistance from an electoral [[malapportionment]], or [[gerrymander]], known as the [[Playmander]]. The LCL's [[Steele Hall]] governed for one term from the [[1968 South Australian state election|1968 election]] to the [[1970 South Australian state election|1970 election]] and during this time began the process of dismantling the Playmander. [[David Tonkin]], as leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia]], became Premier at the [[1979 South Australian state election|1979 election]] for one term, losing office at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 election]]. The Liberals returned to power at the [[1993 South Australian state election|1993 election]], led by Premiers [[Dean Brown]], [[John Olsen]] and [[Rob Kerin]] through two terms, until their defeat at the [[2002 South Australian state election|2002 election]]. They remained in opposition for 16 years, under a record five [[Leader of the Opposition (South Australia)|Opposition Leaders]], until [[Steven Marshall]] led the party to victory in 2018.\n\nThe dual aligned [[Country Liberal Party]] ruled the [[Northern Territory]] from 1978 to 2001.\n\nThe party has held office in Western Australia intermittently since 1947. Liberal [[Richard Court]] was Premier of the state for most of the 1990s.\n\nIn New South Wales, the Liberal Party has not been in office as much as its Labor rival, and just three leaders have led the party from opposition to government in that state: Sir [[Robert Askin]], who was premier from 1965 to 1975, [[Nick Greiner]], who came to office in 1988 and resigned in 1992, and [[Barry O'Farrell]] who would lead the party out of 16 years in opposition in 2011.\n\nThe Liberal Party does not officially contest most local government elections, although many members do run for office in local government as independents. An exception is the [[Brisbane City Council]], where both [[Sallyanne Atkinson]] and [[Campbell Newman]] have been elected [[Lord Mayor of Brisbane]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.abc.net.au/thepollvault/2007/11/can-do-campbell.html|title= The Poll Vault: Can do Campbell now the Libs man|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071128104414/http://blogs.abc.net.au/thepollvault/2007/11/can-do-campbell.html|archivedate= 28 November 2007|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Howard Government===\n{{Main|Howard Government}}\n[[File:Image-Howard2003upr.JPG|left|100px|thumb|[[John Howard]], Prime Minister 1996\u20132007]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin at APEC Summit in Australia 7-9 September 2007-18.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[John Howard]] with [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] leaders in Sydney in 2007.

His government concluded the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]] with the Bush Administration in 2004.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHoward differed from his Labor predecessor Paul Keating in that he supported traditional Australian institutions like the [[Monarchy in Australia]], the commemoration of [[ANZAC Day]] and the design of the Australian flag, but like Keating he pursued privatisation of public utilities and the introduction of a broad based consumption tax (although Keating had dropped support for a GST by the time of his 1993 election victory). Howard's premiership coincided with Al Qaeda's 11 September attacks on the United States. The [[Howard Government]] invoked the ANZUS treaty in response to the attacks and supported America's campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 Federal elections]] the party strengthened its majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|Lower House]] and, with its coalition partners, became the first federal government in twenty years to gain an absolute majority in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. This control of both houses permitted their passing of legislation without the need to negotiate with independents or minor parties, exemplified by industrial relations legislation known as [[WorkChoices]], a wide-ranging effort to increase deregulation of industrial laws in Australia.\n\nIn 2005, Howard reflected on his government's cultural and foreign policy outlook in oft repeated terms:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.chineseembassy.org/eng/xw/t190220.htm |title=Transcript of the Prime Ministerthe Hon John Howard Mpaddress to the Lowy Institute For International Policy |publisher=Au.chineseembassy.org |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|When I became Prime Minister nine years ago, I believed that this nation was defining its place in the world too narrowly.

Historically, the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades. However, from its foundation the party has identified itself as an anti-socialist grouping of liberals and conservatives. Strong opposition to socialism and communism in Australia and abroad was one of its founding principles. The party's founder and longest-serving leader [[Robert Menzies]] envisaged that Australia's middle class would form its main constituency.<ref>[[The Forgotten People]]</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his term as Prime Minister of Australia and in a final address to the Liberal Party Federal Council in 1964, Menzies spoke of the \"Liberal Creed\" as follows:\n\n{{quotation|As the etymology of our name \"Liberal\" indicates, we have stood for freedom... We took the name 'Liberal' because we were determined to be a progressive party, willing to make experiments, in no sense reactionary but believing in the individual, his right and his enterprise, and rejecting the socialist panacea. We have realised that men and women are not just ciphers in a calculation, but are individual human beings whose individual welfare and development must be the main concern of government ... We have learned that the right answer is to set the individual free, to aim at equality of opportunity, to protect the individual against oppression, to create a society in which rights and duties are recognised and made effective.|Robert Menzies<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theaustralian.com/news/opinion/we-believe-the-liberal-party-and-the-liberal-cause/story-e6frg6zo-1225791120808 | title=We believe: the Liberal party and the liberal cause | date=26 October 2009 | work=The Australian}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after the election of the [[Howard Government]] the new Prime Minister [[John Howard]], who was to become the second-longest serving Liberal Prime Minister, spoke of his interpretation of the \"Liberal Tradition\" in a Robert Menzies Lecture in 1996:\n\n{{quotation|Menzies knew the importance for Australian Liberalism to draw upon both the classical liberal as well as the conservative political traditions.

In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auspsa.org.au/sites/default/files/the_australian_greens_and_the_moral_middle_class_robert_simms.pdf|title=The Australian Greens and the Moral Middle Class|first=Robert|last=Simms|publisher=Australian Political Studies Association|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the [[Australian Democrats]], founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister [[Don Chipp]] and members of minor liberal parties.

Today the party is divided on the question of republicanism, with some (such as incumbent leader [[Scott Morrison]]) being monarchists, while others (such as his predecessor [[Malcolm Turnbull]]) are [[Australian republicanism|republicans]]. The Menzies Government formalised Australia's [[ANZUS|alliance with the United States]] in 1951 and the party has remained a strong supporter of the mutual defence treaty.\n\nDomestically, Menzies presided over a fairly regulated economy in which utilities were publicly owned, and commercial activity was highly regulated through centralised wage-fixing and high [[tariff]] protection. Liberal leaders from Menzies to [[Malcolm Fraser]] generally maintained Australia's high tariff levels. At that time the Liberals' coalition partner, the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the older of the two in the coalition (now known as the \"National Party\"), had considerable influence over the government's economic policies. It was not until the late 1970s and through their period out of power federally in the 1980s that the party came to be influenced by what was known as the \"[[New Right]]\"\u2014a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation, privatisation of public utilities, reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts.\n\nSocially, while liberty and freedom of enterprise form the basis of its beliefs, elements of the party have wavered between what is termed \"small-l liberalism\" and social conservatism. Historically, Liberal Governments have been responsible for the carriage of a number of notable \"socially liberal\" reforms, including the opening of Australia to multiethnic immigration under Menzies and [[Harold Holt]]; Holt's [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]] on Aboriginal Rights;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/publications/fact-sheets/fs150.aspx |title=Fact sheets \u2013 National Archives of Australia |publisher=Naa.gov.au |date=27 May 1967 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104121728/http://naa.gov.au/about-us/publications/fact-sheets/fs150.aspx |archive-date=4 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[John Gorton]]'s [[Australian Council for the Arts|support for cinema and the arts]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianscreen.com.au/chronology/1960s/ |title=Chronology 1960s \u2013 ASO |publisher=Australianscreen.com.au |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> selection of the first Aboriginal Senator, [[Neville Bonner]], in 1971;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/features/obits/bonner/bonner_bio.htm |title=ABC News Obituary \u2013 Neville Bonner |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> and Malcolm Fraser's [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]].

Menzies deliberately created a weak national party machine and strong state divisions. Party policy is made almost entirely by the parliamentary parties, not by the party's rank-and-file members, although Liberal party members do have a degree of influence over party policy.<ref name=ourstructure>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.org.au/our-structure|title=Our Structure|date=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Liberal Party's basic organisational unit is the ''branch'', which consists of party members in a particular locality. For each electorate there is a ''conference''\u2014notionally above the branches\u2014which coordinates campaigning in the electorate and regularly communicates with the member (or candidate) for the electorate. As there are three levels of government in Australia, each branch elects delegates to a local, state, and federal conference.<ref name=ourstructure />\n\nAll the branches in an Australian state are grouped into a ''Division''.

More broadly, the Liberal Party's ideological ancestry stretched back to the anti-Labor groupings in the first Commonwealth parliaments. The [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] was a fusion of the [[Free Trade Party]] and the [[Protectionist Party]] in 1909 by the second prime minister, [[Alfred Deakin]], in response to [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]'s growing electoral prominence. The Commonwealth Liberal Party merged with several Labor dissidents (including [[Billy Hughes]]) to form the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917. That party, in turn, merged with Labor dissidents to form the UAP in 1931.\n\nThe UAP had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector [[Joseph Lyons]] as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the [[Great Depression]] had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/before-office.aspx |title=Before office\u2014Joseph Lyons\u2014Australia's PMs\u2014Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the [[Lyons Government]] went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian pump-priming]] and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw [[Robert Menzies]] assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as [[Menzies Government (1939\u20131941)|Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941]] but resigned as leader of the minority [[World War II]] government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the [[1943 Australian federal election|1943 election]].  In New South Wales, the party merged with the [[Commonwealth Party (New South Wales)|Commonwealth Party]] to form the [[Democratic Party (1943)|Democratic Party]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/17869825|title=\"Democratic Party\" Formed|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=25 November 1943|accessdate=29 November 2019}}</ref> In Queensland [[United Australia Party \u2013 Queensland|the state party]] was absorbed into the [[Queensland People's Party]].<ref>John Laverty, 'Chandler, Sir John Beals (1887\u20131962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chandler-sir-john-beals-9724/text17171, published first in hardcopy 1993.

Australia experienced prolonged economic growth during the post-war boom period of the [[Menzies Government (1949\u20131966)]] and Menzies fulfilled his promises at the 1949 election to end rationing of butter, tea and petrol and provided a five-shilling endowment for first-born children, as well as for others.<ref>Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978</ref> While himself an unashamed anglophile, Menzies' government concluded a number of major defence and trade treaties that set Australia on its post-war trajectory out of Britain's orbit; opened up Australia to multi-ethnic immigration; and instigated important legal reforms regarding Aboriginal Australians.\n\nMenzies was strongly opposed to Labor's plans to nationalise the Australian banking system and, following victory at the 1949 election, secured a [[double dissolution]] election for [[1951 Australian federal election|April 1951]], after the Labor-controlled Senate rejected his banking legislation. The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with control of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].

External Affairs Minister [[Percy Spender]] had put forward the proposal to work along similar lines to the NATO Alliance. The Treaty declared that any attack on one of the three parties in the Pacific area would be viewed as a threat to each, and that the common danger would be met in accordance with each nation's constitutional processes. In 1954, the Menzies Government signed the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty ([[SEATO]]) as a South East Asian counterpart to NATO.

The Gorton Government passed legislation establishing equal pay for men and women and increased pensions, allowances and education scholarships, as well as providing free health care to 250,000 of the nation's poor (but not universal health care).

In 1971, Defence Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], resigned and said Gorton was \"not fit to hold the great office of Prime Minister\". In a vote on the leadership the Liberal Party split 50/50, and although this was insufficient to remove him as the leader, Gorton decided this was also insufficient support for him, and he resigned.<ref name=\"primeministers.naa.gov.au\"/>\n\n===McMahon Government and Snedden leadership===\n{{Main|McMahon Government}}\n[[File:McMahon 1971 (cropped).jpg|left|100px|thumb|[[William McMahon]], Prime Minister 1971\u201372]]\n[[File:Billy Snedden 1972.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Billy Snedden]], Opposition Leader 1972\u201375]]\nFormer treasurer, [[William McMahon]], replaced Gorton as Prime Minister.

Whitlam refused, yet Fraser insisted leading to the divisive [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The deadlock came to an end when the Whitlam government was controversially dismissed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] on 11 November 1975 and Fraser was installed as caretaker Prime Minister, pending an election. Fraser won in a landslide at the resulting [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 election]].\n\nFraser maintained some of the social reforms of the Whitlam era, while seeking increased fiscal restraint. His government included the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian, [[Neville Bonner]], and in 1976, Parliament passed the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]], which, while limited to the Northern Territory, affirmed \"inalienable\" freehold title to some traditional lands. Fraser established the multicultural broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]<ref>https://www.nma.gov.au/explore/features/prime-ministers/malcolm-fraser</ref>, accepted [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees, opposed minority white rule in [[apartheid]] South Africa and [[Rhodesia]] and opposed Soviet expansionism. A significant program of economic reform, however, was not pursued. By 1983, the [[Australian economy]] was suffering with the [[early 1980s recession]] and amidst the effects of a severe drought. Fraser had promoted \"states' rights\" and his government refused to use Commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the [[Franklin Dam]] in Tasmania in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fraser/in-office.aspx |title=In office \u2013 Malcolm Fraser \u2013 Australia's PMs \u2013 Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> Liberal minister [[Don Chipp]] split off from the party to form a new [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] party, the [[Australian Democrats]] in 1977.

The Australian economy was facing the [[early 1990s recession]]. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr [[John Hewson]], in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page [[Fightback! (policy)|Fightback!]] policy document\u2014a radical collection of [[Neoliberalism|\"dry\"]], [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] measures including the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), various changes to [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] including the abolition of [[bulk billing]] for non-[[Social security|concession holders]], the introduction of a nine-month limit on [[unemployment benefits]], various changes to [[industrial relations]] including the abolition of [[Industrial award|awards]], a $13&nbsp;billion personal [[income tax]] cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10&nbsp;billion in [[government spending]] cuts, the abolition of state [[payroll tax]]es and the [[privatisation]] of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the [[keynesian]] [[economic policies]] practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the [[tax burden]] from [[direct taxation]] of the wealthy to [[indirect taxation]] as a broad-based [[consumption tax]]. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST\u2014leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous [[birthday cake interview]], considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the [[1993 Australian federal election|1993 election]]. A number of the proposals were later adopted into law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the [[John Howard|Howard]] Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the [[Tony Abbott|Abbott]] Liberal government.\n\nAt the state level, the Liberals have been dominant for long periods in all states except Queensland, where they have always held fewer seats than the [[National Party of Australia|National party]] (not to be confused with the old Nationalist Party). The Liberals were in power in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] from 1955 to 1982. [[Jeff Kennett]] led the party back to office in that state in 1992, and remained Premier until 1999.\n\nIn South Australia, initially a Liberal and Country Party affiliated party, the [[Liberal and Country League]] (LCL), mostly led by [[Premier of South Australia]] [[Tom Playford]], was in power from the [[1933 South Australian state election|1933 election]] to the [[1965 South Australian state election|1965 election]], though with assistance from an electoral [[malapportionment]], or [[gerrymander]], known as the [[Playmander]]. The LCL's [[Steele Hall]] governed for one term from the [[1968 South Australian state election|1968 election]] to the [[1970 South Australian state election|1970 election]] and during this time began the process of dismantling the Playmander. [[David Tonkin]], as leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia]], became Premier at the [[1979 South Australian state election|1979 election]] for one term, losing office at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 election]]. The Liberals returned to power at the [[1993 South Australian state election|1993 election]], led by Premiers [[Dean Brown]], [[John Olsen]] and [[Rob Kerin]] through two terms, until their defeat at the [[2002 South Australian state election|2002 election]]. They remained in opposition for 16 years, under a record five [[Leader of the Opposition (South Australia)|Opposition Leaders]], until [[Steven Marshall]] led the party to victory in 2018.\n\nThe dual aligned [[Country Liberal Party]] ruled the [[Northern Territory]] from 1978 to 2001.\n\nThe party has held office in Western Australia intermittently since 1947. Liberal [[Richard Court]] was Premier of the state for most of the 1990s.\n\nIn New South Wales, the Liberal Party has not been in office as much as its Labor rival, and just three leaders have led the party from opposition to government in that state: Sir [[Robert Askin]], who was premier from 1965 to 1975, [[Nick Greiner]], who came to office in 1988 and resigned in 1992, and [[Barry O'Farrell]] who would lead the party out of 16 years in opposition in 2011.\n\nThe Liberal Party does not officially contest most local government elections, although many members do run for office in local government as independents. An exception is the [[Brisbane City Council]], where both [[Sallyanne Atkinson]] and [[Campbell Newman]] have been elected [[Lord Mayor of Brisbane]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.abc.net.au/thepollvault/2007/11/can-do-campbell.html|title= The Poll Vault: Can do Campbell now the Libs man|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071128104414/http://blogs.abc.net.au/thepollvault/2007/11/can-do-campbell.html|archivedate= 28 November 2007|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Howard Government===\n{{Main|Howard Government}}\n[[File:Image-Howard2003upr.JPG|left|100px|thumb|[[John Howard]], Prime Minister 1996\u20132007]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin at APEC Summit in Australia 7-9 September 2007-18.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[John Howard]] with [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] leaders in Sydney in 2007.

His government concluded the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]] with the Bush Administration in 2004.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHoward differed from his Labor predecessor Paul Keating in that he supported traditional Australian institutions like the [[Monarchy in Australia]], the commemoration of [[ANZAC Day]] and the design of the Australian flag, but like Keating he pursued privatisation of public utilities and the introduction of a broad based consumption tax (although Keating had dropped support for a GST by the time of his 1993 election victory). Howard's premiership coincided with Al Qaeda's 11 September attacks on the United States. The [[Howard Government]] invoked the ANZUS treaty in response to the attacks and supported America's campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 Federal elections]] the party strengthened its majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|Lower House]] and, with its coalition partners, became the first federal government in twenty years to gain an absolute majority in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. This control of both houses permitted their passing of legislation without the need to negotiate with independents or minor parties, exemplified by industrial relations legislation known as [[WorkChoices]], a wide-ranging effort to increase deregulation of industrial laws in Australia.\n\nIn 2005, Howard reflected on his government's cultural and foreign policy outlook in oft repeated terms:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.chineseembassy.org/eng/xw/t190220.htm |title=Transcript of the Prime Ministerthe Hon John Howard Mpaddress to the Lowy Institute For International Policy |publisher=Au.chineseembassy.org |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|When I became Prime Minister nine years ago, I believed that this nation was defining its place in the world too narrowly.

He believed in a liberal political tradition that encompassed both [[Edmund Burke]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]\u2014a tradition which I have described in contemporary terms as the [[Broad church#In politics|broad church]] of Australian Liberalism.|John Howard<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\"/>}}\n\nThroughout their history, the Liberals have been in electoral terms largely the party of the middle class (whom Menzies, in the era of the party's formation called \"[[The forgotten people]]\"), though such class-based voting patterns are no longer as clear as they once were. In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auspsa.org.au/sites/default/files/the_australian_greens_and_the_moral_middle_class_robert_simms.pdf|title=The Australian Greens and the Moral Middle Class|first=Robert|last=Simms|publisher=Australian Political Studies Association|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the [[Australian Democrats]], founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister [[Don Chipp]] and members of minor liberal parties.

Today the party is divided on the question of republicanism, with some (such as incumbent leader [[Scott Morrison]]) being monarchists, while others (such as his predecessor [[Malcolm Turnbull]]) are [[Australian republicanism|republicans]]. The Menzies Government formalised Australia's [[ANZUS|alliance with the United States]] in 1951 and the party has remained a strong supporter of the mutual defence treaty.\n\nDomestically, Menzies presided over a fairly regulated economy in which utilities were publicly owned, and commercial activity was highly regulated through centralised wage-fixing and high [[tariff]] protection. Liberal leaders from Menzies to [[Malcolm Fraser]] generally maintained Australia's high tariff levels. At that time the Liberals' coalition partner, the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the older of the two in the coalition (now known as the \"National Party\"), had considerable influence over the government's economic policies. It was not until the late 1970s and through their period out of power federally in the 1980s that the party came to be influenced by what was known as the \"[[New Right]]\"\u2014a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation, privatisation of public utilities, reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts.\n\nSocially, while liberty and freedom of enterprise form the basis of its beliefs, elements of the party have wavered between what is termed \"small-l liberalism\" and social conservatism. Historically, Liberal Governments have been responsible for the carriage of a number of notable \"socially liberal\" reforms, including the opening of Australia to multiethnic immigration under Menzies and [[Harold Holt]]; Holt's [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]] on Aboriginal Rights;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/publications/fact-sheets/fs150.aspx |title=Fact sheets \u2013 National Archives of Australia |publisher=Naa.gov.au |date=27 May 1967 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104121728/http://naa.gov.au/about-us/publications/fact-sheets/fs150.aspx |archive-date=4 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[John Gorton]]'s [[Australian Council for the Arts|support for cinema and the arts]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianscreen.com.au/chronology/1960s/ |title=Chronology 1960s \u2013 ASO |publisher=Australianscreen.com.au |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> selection of the first Aboriginal Senator, [[Neville Bonner]], in 1971;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/features/obits/bonner/bonner_bio.htm |title=ABC News Obituary \u2013 Neville Bonner |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> and Malcolm Fraser's [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]].

It is those Australians that we have been working for, for the last five and a half years since we came to Government, under [[Tony Abbott]]'s leadership back in 2013. It has been those Australians who have worked hard every day, they have their dreams, they have their aspirations; to get a job, to get an apprenticeship, to start a business, to meet someone amazing. To start a family, to buy a home, to work hard and provide the best you can for your kids. To save your retirement and to ensure that when you're in your retirement, that you can enjoy it because you've worked hard for it. These are [[The Quiet Australians]] who have won a great victory tonight.</blockquote>\n\nThe Liberal Party is a member of the [[International Democrat Union]].\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Liberal Party's organisation is dominated by the six state divisions, reflecting the party's original commitment to a federalised system of government (a commitment which was strongly maintained by all Liberal governments bar the Gorton government until 1983, but was to a large extent abandoned by the Howard Government, which showed strong centralising tendencies). Menzies deliberately created a weak national party machine and strong state divisions. Party policy is made almost entirely by the parliamentary parties, not by the party's rank-and-file members, although Liberal party members do have a degree of influence over party policy.<ref name=ourstructure>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.org.au/our-structure|title=Our Structure|date=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Liberal Party's basic organisational unit is the ''branch'', which consists of party members in a particular locality. For each electorate there is a ''conference''\u2014notionally above the branches\u2014which coordinates campaigning in the electorate and regularly communicates with the member (or candidate) for the electorate. As there are three levels of government in Australia, each branch elects delegates to a local, state, and federal conference.<ref name=ourstructure />\n\nAll the branches in an Australian state are grouped into a ''Division''. The ruling body for the Division is a ''State Council''. There is also one ''Federal Council'' which represents the entire organisational Liberal Party in Australia. Branch executives are delegates to the Councils ''ex-officio'' and additional delegates are elected by branches, depending on their size.<ref name=ourstructure />\n\nPreselection of electoral candidates is performed by a special [[electoral college]] convened for the purpose. Membership of the electoral college consists of head office delegates, branch officers, and elected delegates from branches.<ref name=ourstructure />\n\n==List of leaders==\n{{See|Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia}}\nThe following is a complete list of Liberal Party leaders:\n\n'''Key:'''<br />\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party of Australia/meta/color}}|Liberal|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Australian Labor Party/meta/color}}|[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{National Party of Australia/meta/color}}|[[National Party of Australia|Country/National]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br />\n''PM'': [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|Prime Minister]]<br />\n''LO'': [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]<br />\n\u2020: Died in office\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| No.\n!

She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]], and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained renown for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=Anything/>\n\nIn California, Bosworth was educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]]; later, she went to the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\n==Career==\n===Acting===\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Garfield|first=David|year=1980|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|page=277|isbn=978-0025426504}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|author=NPR Staff|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=National Public Radio, Inc.|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|language=en|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Journalist===\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The X-Rated Emperor|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/02/guccione200502|issn=0733-8899|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=United States|date=November 10, 2009|| publication-date=February 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]], and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained renown for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=Anything/>\n\nIn California, Bosworth was educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]] and then the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\n==Career==\n===Acting===\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Garfield|first=David|year=1980|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|page=277|isbn=978-0025426504}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|author=NPR Staff|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=National Public Radio, Inc.|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|language=en|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Journalist===\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The X-Rated Emperor|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/02/guccione200502|issn=0733-8899|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=United States|date=November 10, 2009|| publication-date=February 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.
