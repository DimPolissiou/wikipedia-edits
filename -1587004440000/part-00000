Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton.

The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into [[St James' Park]].<ref name=formation>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/ClubHistory/0,,10278~2108980,00.html\n |title=The Formation of Newcastle United\n |author=P.

Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.<ref name=formation /><ref name=st_james>{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Mike Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium.<ref name=off_market /><ref name=direct>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n| title      = Newcastle reveal new stadium name\n|work=BBC Sport\n| date       = 4 November 2009\n| accessdate =4 November 2009\n| location   = London\n}}</ref> This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the [[2009\u201310 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]], but lasted until November 2011.<ref name=direct /><ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n| title       = Newcastle 'have cost Ashley \u00a3285.8m so far'\n| first       = Simon\n| last        = Bird\n| date        = 29 March 2011\n| work=Daily Mirror |location=UK\n| accessdate  =13 April 2011\n}}</ref> On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.

She went to the university of Zurich to study medicine and graduated in 1957.\n\nDuring World War II she worked with refugees, in [[Z\u00fcrich]], and following the war, did relief work in Poland. She would later visit Majandek death camp which sparked her interest in the power of compassion and resilience of the human spirit. The horror stories of the survivors left permanent impressions on Elisabeth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Blaylock|first=B|date=2005|title=In memoriam: Elisabeth kubler-ross, 1926-2004.|url=|journal=Families, Systems, & Health.|volume=23|pages=108-109|via=EBSCO}}</ref>\n\nShe was profoundly affected by a visit to the Maidanek concentration camp in Poland and the images of hundreds of butterflies carved into some of the walls there. To K\u00fcbler-Ross, the butterflies\u2014these final works of art by those facing death\u2014stayed with her for years and influenced her thinking about the end of life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1958 she married a fellow medical student from America, Emanuel (\"Manny\") Ross, and moved to the United States. Becoming pregnant disqualified her from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. After suffering two miscarriages, she had a son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Kenneth]], and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/K-bler-Ross-Elisabeth.html K\u00fcbler-Ross, Elisabeth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her husband requested a divorce in 1979.\n\n==Academic career==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continued her studies.\n\nShe began her psychiatric residency in the [[Manhattan Psychiatric Center|Manhattan State Hospital]] in the early 1960's, she began her career working to create treatment for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title \"hopeless patient\". These treatment programs would work to restore the patient's sense of dignity and self-respect. Elisabeth also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world<ref name=\":1\" />  During her time at the hospital, she realized how appalling the treatments of the imminently dying patients were. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals.\n\nIn 1962, she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. There, Elisabeth was a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but K\u00fcbler-Ross wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. <ref name=\":1\" /> She states to her students,<blockquote>\"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now you'll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to treat them with compassion the same compassion that you would want for yourself\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>K\u00fcbler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and then moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nA Life magazine ran an article on K\u00fcbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K\u00fcbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the \u201cgreatest mystery in science\u201d\u2014death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Healing Center==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded \"[[Shanti Nilaya]]\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \"entities\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \"spirits\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G.

Her reputation began to decline when she began researching the controversial subject of near-death experiences. Elisabeth was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife,<ref name=\":1\" /> serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS)<ref name=\":0\" /> Elisabeth reported her interviews for the first time in her book, [[On Death and Dying]]: ''What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families'' (1969)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_KHpHlsAM4 ''Video: Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross \u00fcber Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) ''], abgerufen am 14.

This was inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nShe conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.\n\n==Death==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, in the meantime Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed. She found herself living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.<ref>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. {{ISBN|9781587613180}}</ref>. Further, in a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a \"damned procrastinator\"<ref name=\":0\" />. Elisabeth died in 2004 at a nursing home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in the presence of her son, daughter, and two family friends.<ref name=\":0\" />  She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery.\n\n== Contributions ==\nElisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross was the first individual to transfigure the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice-care and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals' lives to the public eye.<ref name=\":1\" /> Elisabeth was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to \u201ctreat the dying with dignity\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />  Her extensive work with the dying led to the internationally best-selling book [[On Death and Dying]] in 1969, she proposed the, now famous, [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The five stages have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike.\n\nElisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring a book with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]] on grief and grieving.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n*''On Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1969\n*''Questions & Answers on Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1972\n*''Death: The Final Stage of Growth'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1974\n* ''Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', Macmillan, 1976. {{ISBN|0-02-567120-0}}.\n*''To Live Until We Say Goodbye'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1978\n*''The Dougy Letter -A Letter to a Dying Child'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1979\n*''Quest, Biography of EKR (Written with Derek Gill)'', (Harper & Row), 1980\n*''Working It Through'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Living with Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Remember the Secret'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1981\n*''On Children & Death'', (Simon & Schuster), 1985\n*''AIDS: The Ultimate Challenge'', (Simon & Schuster), 1988\n*''On Life After Death'', (Celestial Arts), 1991\n*''Death Is of Vital Importance'', (Out of Print- Now ''The Tunnel and the Light''), 1995\n*''Unfolding the Wings of Love'' (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1996\n*''Making the Most of the Inbetween'', (Various Foreign), 1996\n*''AIDS & Love'', The Conference in Barcelona, (Spain), 1996\n*''Longing to Go Back Home'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1997\n* ''Working It Through: An Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross Workshop on Life, Death, and Transition'', Simon & Schuster, 1997. {{ISBN|0-684-83942-3}}.\n*''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Scribner), 1997\n*''Why Are We Here'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1999\n*''The Tunnel and the Light'', (Avalon), 1999\n*''Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]], Scribner, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-87074-6}}.\n* ''On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]].

She went to the university of Zurich to study medicine and graduated in 1957.\n\nDuring World War II she worked with refugees, in [[Z\u00fcrich]], and following the war, did relief work in Poland. She would later visit Majandek death camp which sparked her interest in the power of compassion and resilience of the human spirit. The horror stories of the survivors left permanent impressions on Elisabeth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Blaylock|first=B|date=2005|title=In memoriam: Elisabeth kubler-ross, 1926-2004.|url=|journal=Families, Systems, & Health.|volume=23|pages=108-109|via=EBSCO}}</ref>\n\nShe was profoundly affected by a visit to the Maidanek concentration camp in Poland and the images of hundreds of butterflies carved into some of the walls there. To K\u00fcbler-Ross, the butterflies\u2014these final works of art by those facing death\u2014stayed with her for years and influenced her thinking about the end of life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1958 she married a fellow medical student from America, Emanuel (\"Manny\") Ross, and moved to the United States. Becoming pregnant disqualified her from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. After suffering two miscarriages, she had a son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Kenneth]], and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/K-bler-Ross-Elisabeth.html K\u00fcbler-Ross, Elisabeth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her husband requested a divorce in 1979.\n\n==Academic career==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continued her studies.\n\nShe began her psychiatric residency in the [[Manhattan Psychiatric Center|Manhattan State Hospital]] in the early 1960's, she began her career working to create treatment for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title \"hopeless patient\". These treatment programs would work to restore the patient's sense of dignity and self-respect. Elisabeth also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world<ref name=\":1\" />  During her time at the hospital, she realized how appalling the treatments of the imminently dying patients were. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals.\n\nIn 1962, she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. There, Elisabeth was a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but K\u00fcbler-Ross wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. <ref name=\":1\" /> She states to her students,<blockquote>\"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now you'll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to treat them with compassion the same compassion that you would want for yourself\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>K\u00fcbler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and then moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nA Life magazine ran an article on K\u00fcbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K\u00fcbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the \u201cgreatest mystery in science\u201d\u2014death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Healing Center==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded \"[[Shanti Nilaya]]\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \"entities\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \"spirits\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G.

Elisabeth was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife,<ref name=\":1\" /> serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS)<ref name=\":0\" /> Elisabeth reported her interviews for the first time in her book, [[On Death and Dying]]: ''What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families'' (1969)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_KHpHlsAM4 ''Video: Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross \u00fcber Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) ''], abgerufen am 14.

This was inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nShe conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.\n\n==Death==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, in the meantime Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed. She found herself living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.<ref>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. {{ISBN|9781587613180}}</ref>. Further, in a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a \"damned procrastinator\"<ref name=\":0\" />. Elisabeth died in 2004 at a nursing home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in the presence of her son, daughter, and two family friends.<ref name=\":0\" />  She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery.\n\n== Contributions ==\nElisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross was the first individual to transfigure the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice-care and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals' lives to the public eye.<ref name=\":1\" /> Elisabeth was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to \u201ctreat the dying with dignity\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />  Her extensive work with the dying led to the internationally best-selling book [[On Death and Dying]] in 1969, she proposed the, now famous, [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The five stages have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike.\n\nElisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring a book with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]] on grief and grieving.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n*''On Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1969\n*''Questions & Answers on Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1972\n*''Death: The Final Stage of Growth'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1974\n* ''Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', Macmillan, 1976. {{ISBN|0-02-567120-0}}.\n*''To Live Until We Say Goodbye'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1978\n*''The Dougy Letter -A Letter to a Dying Child'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1979\n*''Quest, Biography of EKR (Written with Derek Gill)'', (Harper & Row), 1980\n*''Working It Through'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Living with Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Remember the Secret'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1981\n*''On Children & Death'', (Simon & Schuster), 1985\n*''AIDS: The Ultimate Challenge'', (Simon & Schuster), 1988\n*''On Life After Death'', (Celestial Arts), 1991\n*''Death Is of Vital Importance'', (Out of Print- Now ''The Tunnel and the Light''), 1995\n*''Unfolding the Wings of Love'' (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1996\n*''Making the Most of the Inbetween'', (Various Foreign), 1996\n*''AIDS & Love'', The Conference in Barcelona, (Spain), 1996\n*''Longing to Go Back Home'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1997\n* ''Working It Through: An Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross Workshop on Life, Death, and Transition'', Simon & Schuster, 1997. {{ISBN|0-684-83942-3}}.\n*''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Scribner), 1997\n*''Why Are We Here'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1999\n*''The Tunnel and the Light'', (Avalon), 1999\n*''Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]], Scribner, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-87074-6}}.\n* ''On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]].

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\nThe municipality of Gandara is known for its products such as queseo, rice, rootcrops and peanuts exported in the entire region of Eastern Visayas and any point of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nGandara is the home also of the well-known corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez believed to be miraculous by the Gandare\u00f1os.\n[[File:Ma._Diana\u2019s_Chapel_in_Gandara,_Samar_(Home_of_the_miraculous_corpse_of_Maria_Diana_Alvarez).jpg|thumb|Ma.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\nThe municipality of Gandara is known for its products such as queseo, rice, rootcrops and peanuts exported in the entire region of Eastern Visayas and any point of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nGandara is the home also of the well-known corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez believed to be miraculous by the Gandare\u00f1os.\n[[File:Ma._Diana\u2019s_Chapel_in_Gandara,_Samar_(Home_of_the_miraculous_corpse_of_Maria_Diana_Alvarez).jpg|thumb|Ma.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading.

The franchise follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[anthropomorphic]] blue hedgehog who battles the evil [[Doctor Eggman]], a [[mad scientist]]. The main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games are [[platformer]]s mostly developed by [[Sonic Team]]; other games, developed by various studios, include [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the [[racing video game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], [[party game|party]] and [[sports game|sports]] genres. The franchise also incorporates [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog printed media|printed media]], [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog features|animations]], a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|2020 feature film]], and merchandise.\n\nThe [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|first ''Sonic'' game]], released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with [[Nintendo]]'s mascot [[Mario]]. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the [[16-bit era]] of the early 1990s. [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed the next three ''Sonic'' games in addition to ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'' (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] era, the first major 3D ''Sonic'' game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', was released in 1998 for the [[Dreamcast]]. Sega exited the console market and shifted to [[third-party development]] in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, [[Xbox]], and [[PlayStation]] systems.\n\nWhile ''Sonic'' games often have unique [[game mechanics]] and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based [[Health (game terminology)|health]] system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|large cast of characters]]; some, such as [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], starred in self-titled spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] such as ''[[Sega All-Stars (series)|Sega All-Stars]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the [[best-selling video game franchises]], grossing over {{US$|5 billion|long=no}} by 2014 and selling 140{{nbsp}}million by 2016. Series sales and [[free-to-play]] [[mobile game]] downloads totaled 920{{nbsp}}million by 2019. The Genesis ''Sonic'' games have been described as representative of the [[culture of the 1990s]] and listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest of all time]]. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, ''Sonic'' is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.\n\n=={{anchor|Video games|History}}Development==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

The franchise follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[anthropomorphic]] blue hedgehog who battles the evil [[Doctor Eggman]], a [[mad scientist]]. The main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games are [[platformer]]s mostly developed by [[Sonic Team]]; other games, developed by various studios, include [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the [[racing video game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], [[party game|party]] and [[sports game|sports]] genres. The franchise also incorporates [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog printed media|printed media]], [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog features|animations]], a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|2020 feature film]], and merchandise.\n\nThe [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|first ''Sonic'' game]], released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with [[Nintendo]]'s mascot [[Mario]]. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the [[16-bit era]] of the early 1990s. [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed the next three ''Sonic'' games in addition to ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'' (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] era, the first major 3D ''Sonic'' game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', was released in 1998 for the [[Dreamcast]]. Sega exited the console market and shifted to [[third-party development]] in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, [[Xbox]], and [[PlayStation]] systems.\n\nWhile ''Sonic'' games often have unique [[game mechanics]] and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based [[Health (game terminology)|health]] system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|large cast of characters]]; some, such as [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], starred in self-titled spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] such as ''[[Sega All-Stars (series)|Sega All-Stars]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the [[best-selling video game franchises]], selling 89{{nbsp}}million by March 2011 and grossing over {{US$|5 billion|long=no}} by 2014. Series sales and [[free-to-play]] [[mobile game]] downloads totaled 920{{nbsp}}million by 2019. The Genesis ''Sonic'' games have been described as representative of the [[culture of the 1990s]] and listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest of all time]]. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, ''Sonic'' is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.\n\n=={{anchor|Video games|History}}Development==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.
