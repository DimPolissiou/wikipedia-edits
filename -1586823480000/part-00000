Argentina had had a goal difference of +2, but in its last group match, it defeated Peru 6\u20130, and thus qualified for the final in a match accused of ultimately-unproven [[match fixing]]. The [[Brazil at the 1978 FIFA World Cup#Starting 11|Brazilian team]] qualified for the third place, and were the only team to remain unbeaten in the tournament.\n\nAt the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], held in Spain, Brazil were the tournament favorites, and easily moved through the early part of the draw, but a [[Brazil vs Italy (1982)|3\u20132 defeat]] in Barcelona to Italy, in a classic World Cup match, eliminated them from the tournament in the match that they refer to as \"Sarri\u00e1's Disaster\", referencing the stadium's name.

The game played to a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time, and after a goalless extra time, it all came down to a penalty shoot-out, where Brazil was defeated 4\u20133. After 40 years, Brazil was victorious in the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], this being their fourth victory in four tournaments hosted in Brazil.

Users could be an individual, business or organization. Bloggers writing about FriendFeed said that this service addresses the shortcomings of social media services which exclusively facilitate tracking of their own members' social media activities on that particular social media service, whereas FriendFeed provided the facility to track these activities (such as posting on [[blogs]], [[Twitter]], and [[Flickr]]) across a broad range of different social networks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2007/10/01/friendfeed-a-company-lets-you-see-all-your-friends-feeds/ |title=FriendFeed launch cover on VentureBeat, October 1, 2007 |publisher=Venturebeat.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011933/http://venturebeat.com/2007/10/01/friendfeed-a-company-lets-you-see-all-your-friends-feeds/ |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some bloggers had concerns about readers commenting on their posts on FriendFeed instead of on their blogs, resulting in fewer page views for the blogger.<ref>[http://www.centernetworks.com/conversation-monetization \"Just How Much is the Conversation Worth?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908204342/http://www.centernetworks.com/conversation-monetization |date=2008-09-08 }} CenterNetworks.com, July 3, 2008</ref>\n\nThe founders were all former [[Google]] employees who were involved in the launch of services such as [[Gmail]] and [[Google Maps]]. They included Bret Taylor, Jim Norris, Sanjeev Singh and Paul Buchheit. Along with the latter two founders, [[venture capital]] agency [[Benchmark Capital]] was involved with the investment funding.\n\nFriendFeed was based in [[Mountain View, California]], and had on average one million monthly visitors.

Users could be an individual, business or organization. Bloggers writing about FriendFeed said that this service addresses the shortcomings of social media services which exclusively facilitate tracking of their own members' social media activities on that particular social media service, whereas FriendFeed provided the facility to track these activities (such as posting on [[blogs]], [[Twitter]], and [[Flickr]]) across a broad range of different social networks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2007/10/01/friendfeed-a-company-lets-you-see-all-your-friends-feeds/ |title=FriendFeed launch cover on VentureBeat, October 1, 2007 |publisher=Venturebeat.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011933/http://venturebeat.com/2007/10/01/friendfeed-a-company-lets-you-see-all-your-friends-feeds/ |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some bloggers had concerns about readers commenting on their posts on FriendFeed instead of on their blogs, resulting in fewer page views for the blogger.<ref>[http://www.centernetworks.com/conversation-monetization \"Just How Much is the Conversation Worth?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908204342/http://www.centernetworks.com/conversation-monetization |date=2008-09-08 }} CenterNetworks.com, July 3, 2008</ref>\n\nThe founders were all former [[Google]] employees who were involved in the launch of services such as [[Gmail]] and [[Google Maps]].

[[Twelver]] Shias believe that al-Mahdi was born on the 15th [[Sha'ban]] 869 CE/ 255 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] and assumed [[Imamate]] at nearly 5 years of age following the killing of his father [[Hasan al-Askari]]. In the early years of his Imamah, he is believed to have had contact with his followers only through [[The Four Deputies]]. This period was known as the [[Minor Occultation]] ({{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0635\u064f\u0651\u063a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670}}) and lasted from 873\u2013941 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=10731|title=The great Shia scholar, Abu Ja\u2019far Mohammad ibn Uthman al-Amri \u2013 Imam Reza (A.S.)

P11</ref> A few days before the death of his fourth deputy [[Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri]] in 941, he is believed to have sent his followers a letter. In that letter, which was transmitted by al-Samarri, he declared the beginning of [[Major Occultation]] ({{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670}}), during which Mahdi was not to be in contact with his followers directly, but had instructed them to follow the pious high clerics for whom he has mentioned some distinguishing merits.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Sunni Muslims]] reject that he is the Mahdi and believe that the Mahdi has not yet been born. They believe his exact identity is only known to [[God in Islam|Allah]], other than the idea that he is to be from the descendants of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]].

Although during the lesser occultation the network of Imam deputies (wikala) claimed to have the right to handle Shia communities' issues, this system was not continued during the Greater Occultation.<ref name=Momen/> After the greater occultation, the role of Imam as the head of community was left vacant, which did not theoretically matter at the beginning of Occultation because Shias had no political power at that time. However, when Shia states arose in later centuries, since the hidden Imam was alive and was the leader of Muslims, the role of the Shia states among Shia communities was in question.<ref name=Momen/>\nThis problem has caused continuing tension between government and religion throughout Shia history.<ref name=Momen>{{cite book|last=Momen|first=Moojan|title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=170|isbn=978-0-300-03531-5}}</ref>\n\nThe occultation has resulted in many people claiming to be the returned Mahdi.

Shi'as believe that [[Jesus in Islam|`\u00ces\u00e2 (Jesus)]] will also come (after Imam Mahdi's re-appearance) and follow the Imam to destroy tyranny and falsehood and to bring justice and peace to the world.<ref>Sahih Muslim, bab nuzul 'Isa, Vol. 2; Sahih Bukhari, kitab bad' al-khalq wa nuzul 'Isa, Vol. 4</ref> This will also be accompanied by the [[raj'a]] (return) of several other personalities for retribution of the previously oppressed against the oppressor.

The troubled situation of the Abbasid khalifas made people think that a descendant of Muhammad would rise with a sword (Qa'im bi'lsayf) and wipe out injustice on earth which acted as a consolation for the oppressed people who were waiting for the establishment of God's will on earth.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|pp=39\u201340}}</ref>\n\n== Historicity ==\nThe historical existence of the twelfth imam has been long debated since the death of the eleventh Imam.<ref name=\"Goldziher 200\">{{cite book|last=Goldziher|first=Ignaz|title=Introduction to Islamic theology and law|pages=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zeStDQZOSgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=introduction+to+Islamic+theology+and+law&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA}}</ref> Even though Shi'ite Scholars believe that the Twelfth Imam is an actual person, the Eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari, was kept more or less a prisoner by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the camp at [[Samarra]], about {{convert|100|km|mile|abbr=off}} north of [[Baghdad]], and died there in 874 CE at the age of twenty-eight. It appears that none of the Shi'i notables knew of the existence of the son of the eleventh Imam. The only possible occasion the son of the eleventh Imam is said to have made a public appearance was as a child at the time of the eleventh Imam's death, thereafter the boy was seen no more.<ref name=Momen2>{{cite book|last=Momen|first=Moojan|title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam|pages=161\u201366}}</ref>\n\n\nIt was believed that the twelfth Imam was connected to his community through four agents, giving his commands via letter; [https://bahaipedia.org/Moojan_Momen Moojan Momen], a much-published Baha'i historian, doubts the historical accuracy of these accounts, mentioning that there is no indication that the number of agents was limited to four and several others are mentioned. It seems likely that after the death of the eleventh Imam, for the duration of a natural lifespan (i.e. seventy years) this system had continued to operate. The brother of the eleventh Imam, Jafar ibn Ali, remained firm in his assertion that his brother had no progeny and there were legal disputes over the ownership of his brother's estate with the supposed agents.<ref name=Momen2 />\n\nHenry Corbin in contrast believed that the question of historicity is irrelevant admitting that the idea of the hidden Imam was shaped by the person of twelfth and considering the extensive body of literature about him, saw the birth and his occultation as archetypal and symbolic, describing it as \"sacred history\". In his ''History of Islamic Philosophy'' He writes: \"The simultaneity of these (birth and occultation) is rich in meanings from the mystical point of view\u2026 here above all, our approach should be that of the phenomenological: we must discover the aims of Shi\u2019ite awareness...\".<ref name=\"Henry Corbin Pages 69-70\"/>\n\nThere was a hadith that was already present in orthodox Sunni collections wherein Muhammad declares that he will be followed by twelve caliphs (alternative versions have qayyims) from his descendants all from his tribe, the Quraysh. The hadith appears in both Bukhari (as amirs Bab al-istakhlaf, 7062) and Muslim (as \"caliphs\", Bab al-nas taba l-Quraysh, 4667).

Examples of this include the cases of [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] (according to the [[Kaysanites Shia]]), [[Muhammad ibn Abdallah|Muhammad ibn Abdallah An-Nafs Az-Zakiyya]], [[Musa al-Kadhim]] (according to the [[Waqifite Shia]]), [[Muhammad ibn Qasim (al-Alawi)]], [[Yahya ibn Umar]] and [[Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi]] (according to the [[Muhammadite Shia]]).\n\nAccording to Jassem Hossein, traditions regarding occultation of Mahdi had been collected by many different shia sects. Before 874, the traditions existed in Waqifi, Zaydi, Jarudi and Imamite books. In Waqifis, Anmati Ibrahim ibn Salih Koufi, a disciple of the fifth Imam, wrote a book titled \"Occultation\". Ali ibn Hossayn Taee Tatari and Hassan ibn Mohammad ibn Sama'ah each wrote a book titled \"Book of Occultation\" and introduced the seventh Imam as the Imam who will go into Occultation. Among Zaydis AbousSaeed Ibad ibn Yaqub Ravajini Asfari in a book titled Aboosaeed Asfari collects traditions on occultation and the twelve Imams and the end of Imams in twelve without naming them all. From the Twelvers, Ali ibn Mahziar Ahwazi who died on or before 874 CE wrote two books titled, Kitab Al-Malahem and Kitab Alqaem both on occultation and the rise of Imam with sword. Hossein ibn Mahboob Sarad wrote the book titled Al-mashikhah on occultation. Fazl ibn Shazan Nisabouri wrote Al-Qaybah which is narrated from Al-Mashikhah. He died two months before the 11th Imam and declared the twelfth Imam as the Qaem.<ref name=\"al-islam.org\"/>\n\nYaan Richard suggests occultation was a \"convenient solution\" for the last Imams' justification of their quietism.<ref name=Yaan>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Yaan|title=Shi'ite Islam|year=1995|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford UK, Cambridge US}}</ref> According to Sachedina, however, the idea of the eschatological Qa'im who would rise after going to occultation was mentioned by the fifth and sixth Imam, i.e. [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] at various times when the two were approached by their followers and assured of their support if they wanted to rise against the existing regime.<ref>{{harv|Sachedina|1981|pp=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\nHasan al-Askari's estate was divided between his brother Jafar and his mother. Moojan Momen writes: Jafar remained unshakeable in his assertion that his brother (Hasan al-Askari) had no progeny.\"<ref>Momen, Moojan. \"An Introduction to Shi\u2019i Islam\". London, 1985, p.&nbsp;162.</ref> According to Sachadina, \"sources describe Ja'far as a worldly and pleasure-loving man who in order to become the Imam had used various repressive means in the presence of al-Mu'tamid and more than once has tried to slander those who upheld the Imamate of the infant son of al-Askari in concealment.\" <ref name=\"Sachedina 1981 41\">{{harv|Sachedina|1981|p=41}}</ref>\n\nDuring the caliphate of al-Mu'tamid to that of al-Muqtadir, the agents of the dead Imam believed that Hasan al-Askari had left a son who will appear at Allah's will. This group of people were under attack and opposed by others. Al-Mutamid, the Abbasid caliph, ordered to investigate the house of Imam and also to inspect if Imam's wives were pregnant. During these investigations, Narjis was imprisoned for not revealing the place of her baby. In order to promote a dispute within Imam's family, they \"supported Ja'far a brother of al-Askari and claimant to the office of the Imamat\". The situation changed when \"political disturbances caused by the Zanj and provincial leaders in Iran, Egypt and Syria.\" led to the capture of the caliph.<ref name=\"Sachedina 1981 41\"/>\n\nAccording to Jassim M. Hussain, the majority of the Imamites denied his birth or even his existence, and abandoned their belief in the hidden Imam except for a small minority belonging to the circles of narrators, like Ibn Qubba and al-Nu'mani who based their belief on the traditions of the Imams (i.e. Hadith about twelve Imams). Jassim Hussain indicates, several books were written before the minor Occultation predicting the event of the twelfth Imam being the Mahdi and his going to occultation.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/occultation_12imam/3.htm#3Books Hussain, Jassim M.

In the early years of his Imamah, he is believed to have had contact with his followers only through [[The Four Deputies]]. This period was known as the [[Minor Occultation]] ({{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0635\u064f\u0651\u063a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670}}) and lasted from 873\u2013941 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=10731|title=The great Shia scholar, Abu Ja\u2019far Mohammad ibn Uthman al-Amri \u2013 Imam Reza (A.S.)

P11</ref> A few days before the death of his fourth deputy [[Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri]] in 941, he is believed to have sent his followers a letter. In that letter, which was transmitted by al-Samarri, he declared the beginning of [[Major Occultation]] ({{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670}}), during which Mahdi was not to be in contact with his followers directly, but had instructed them to follow the pious high clerics for whom he has mentioned some distinguishing merits.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Sunni Muslims]] reject that he is the Mahdi and believe that the Mahdi has not yet been born. They believe his exact identity is only known to [[God in Islam|Allah]], other than the idea that he is to be from the descendants of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]. Aside from the Mahdi's precise genealogy, Sunnis accept many of the same [[hadith]]s which Shias accept about the predictions regarding the Mahdi's emergence, his acts, and his universal [[Caliphate]]. Sunnis also have many hadiths about Mahdi which are in their Hadith collections.\n\n== Attributes ==\nAccording to the [[Shia]], the Mahdi belongs to [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]'s ''[[Ahl al-Bayt|Bayt]]'' (Household), being a descendant of [[Ali]], [[Fatimah]] and [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]], and is considered by Twelvers to be the son of Al-Askari, and consequently the twelfth Imam of the [[Twelve Imams]] of the ''Bayt''.

The hidden saints live among the people and are aware of them, but the people do not know them. Sura Kahf 18:65\u201366 implies that even though people do not know the hidden saints, they benefit from them like the sun hidden behind the clouds.<ref>{{harvnb|Sobhani|2001|pp=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nShias generally believe that in every age, there is an Imam, either apparent or hidden. But in times that there are dangers threatening the life of the Imam, he is concealed by God's order, hence the Occultation of the twelfth Imam.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|p=23}}</ref> Al-Nu'mani states two reasons for the Occultation in particular: a) a test for the followers of the Imam and their faith, b) saving the Imam from Bay'a (allegiance) to the oppressive leaders.<ref name=\"Sachedina104\">{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|p=104}}</ref> With all that said, a [[Hadith]] states that the real reason for the Occultation will be only known when the Imam re-appears as in the story of [[Musa (prophet)|Musa]] and [[Khidr]] where the reasons for Khidr's deeds were not immediately revealed to Musa.<ref name=\"Sachedina104\" />\n\nWhen Jabir asked Muhammad about the benefits of the hidden Imam, he replied that the people would benefit from his authority ([[Walayah (Twelver doctrine)|Walayah]]) as they benefit from the sun when it is covered by the clouds.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|p=105}}</ref> [[Sharif al-Murtaza]], a classical Shia scholar has argued that the reason for the Imam's Occultation was to protect his life after establishing the just state had been rendered impossible by his enemies.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|p=138}}</ref> But Shias would still benefit from the Imam because belief in his hidden presence keeps them from committing evil in their life.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|p=134}}</ref>\n\nSince Shias believe that [[N\u016br (Islam)|the primordial light of the prophethood]] has continued to shine through the ages in the character of the Imams, be they hidden or apparent, no idea ever rose regarding the inaccessibility of the Hidden Imam in the state of occultation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Messianism.html?id=5zUIYGQT4DwC|title=Islamic Messianism: The Idea of Mahdi in Twelver Shi'ism|last=Sachedina|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|date=1981|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9780873954426|location=|pages=181|language=en}}</ref> According to Baha'i scholar [https://bahaipedia.org/Moojan_Momen Moojan Momen], numerous stories exist of the Hidden Imam \"manifesting himself to prominent members of the [[ulama]] (Muslim religious scholars).\"<ref>Momen, Moojan, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 199</ref> Publishers close to the Lebanese Shia militant organization, [[Hezbollah]], have published accounts by Hezbollah fighters on how Mahdi intervened personally on the battlefields in critical moments during the [[2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict]] to help them fight against the Israeli army.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Minor Occultation ====\n{{Main|Minor Occultation|The Four Deputies}}\n\n''Ghaybat al-Sughra'' or Minor Occultation (874\u2013941), consists of the first few decades of the Imam's disappearance when communication with him was maintained through his deputies.

The troubled situation of the Abbasid khalifas made people think that a descendant of Muhammad would rise with a sword (Qa'im bi'lsayf) and wipe out injustice on earth which acted as a consolation for the oppressed people who were waiting for the establishment of God's will on earth.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachedina|1981|pp=39\u201340}}</ref>\n\n== Historicity ==\nThe historical existence of the twelfth imam has been long debated since the death of the eleventh Imam.<ref name=\"Goldziher 200\">{{cite book|last=Goldziher|first=Ignaz|title=Introduction to Islamic theology and law|pages=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zeStDQZOSgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=introduction+to+Islamic+theology+and+law&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA}}</ref> Even though Shi'ite Scholars believe that the Twelfth Imam is an actual person, the Eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari, was kept more or less a prisoner by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the camp at [[Samarra]], about {{convert|100|km|mile|abbr=off}} north of [[Baghdad]], and died there in 874 CE at the age of twenty-eight. It appears that none of the Shi'i notables knew of the existence of the son of the eleventh Imam. The only possible occasion the son of the eleventh Imam is said to have made a public appearance was as a child at the time of the eleventh Imam's death, thereafter the boy was seen no more.<ref name=Momen2>{{cite book|last=Momen|first=Moojan|title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam|pages=161\u201366}}</ref>\n\n\nIt was believed that the twelfth Imam was connected to his community through four agents, giving his commands via letter; [https://bahaipedia.org/Moojan_Momen Moojan Momen], a much-published Baha'i historian, doubts the historical accuracy of these accounts, mentioning that there is no indication that the number of agents was limited to four and several others are mentioned. It seems likely that after the death of the eleventh Imam, for the duration of a natural lifespan (i.e. seventy years) this system had continued to operate. The brother of the eleventh Imam, Jafar ibn Ali, remained firm in his assertion that his brother had no progeny and there were legal disputes over the ownership of his brother's estate with the supposed agents.<ref name=Momen2 />\n\nHenry Corbin in contrast believed that the question of historicity is irrelevant admitting that the idea of the hidden Imam was shaped by the person of twelfth and considering the extensive body of literature about him, saw the birth and his occultation as archetypal and symbolic, describing it as \"sacred history\". In his ''History of Islamic Philosophy'' He writes: \"The simultaneity of these (birth and occultation) is rich in meanings from the mystical point of view\u2026 here above all, our approach should be that of the phenomenological: we must discover the aims of Shi\u2019ite awareness...\".<ref name=\"Henry Corbin Pages 69-70\"/>\n\nThere was a hadith that was already present in orthodox Sunni collections wherein Muhammad declares that he will be followed by twelve caliphs (alternative versions have qayyims) from his descendants all from his tribe, the Quraysh. The hadith appears in both Bukhari (as amirs Bab al-istakhlaf, 7062) and Muslim (as \"caliphs\", Bab al-nas taba l-Quraysh, 4667).

Examples of this include the cases of [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] (according to the [[Kaysanites Shia]]), [[Muhammad ibn Abdallah|Muhammad ibn Abdallah An-Nafs Az-Zakiyya]], [[Musa al-Kadhim]] (according to the [[Waqifite Shia]]), [[Muhammad ibn Qasim (al-Alawi)]], [[Yahya ibn Umar]] and [[Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi]] (according to the [[Muhammadite Shia]]).\n\nAccording to Jassem Hossein, traditions regarding occultation of Mahdi had been collected by many different shia sects. Before 874, the traditions existed in Waqifi, Zaydi, Jarudi and Imamite books. In Waqifis, Anmati Ibrahim ibn Salih Koufi, a disciple of the fifth Imam, wrote a book titled \"Occultation\". Ali ibn Hossayn Taee Tatari and Hassan ibn Mohammad ibn Sama'ah each wrote a book titled \"Book of Occultation\" and introduced the seventh Imam as the Imam who will go into Occultation. Among Zaydis AbousSaeed Ibad ibn Yaqub Ravajini Asfari in a book titled Aboosaeed Asfari collects traditions on occultation and the twelve Imams and the end of Imams in twelve without naming them all. From the Twelvers, Ali ibn Mahziar Ahwazi who died on or before 874 CE wrote two books titled, Kitab Al-Malahem and Kitab Alqaem both on occultation and the rise of Imam with sword. Hossein ibn Mahboob Sarad wrote the book titled Al-mashikhah on occultation. Fazl ibn Shazan Nisabouri wrote Al-Qaybah which is narrated from Al-Mashikhah. He died two months before the 11th Imam and declared the twelfth Imam as the Qaem.<ref name=\"al-islam.org\"/>\n\nYaan Richard suggests occultation was a \"convenient solution\" for the last Imams' justification of their quietism.<ref name=Yaan>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Yaan|title=Shi'ite Islam|year=1995|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford UK, Cambridge US}}</ref> According to Sachedina, however, the idea of the eschatological Qa'im who would rise after going to occultation was mentioned by the fifth and sixth Imam, i.e. [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] at various times when the two were approached by their followers and assured of their support if they wanted to rise against the existing regime.<ref>{{harv|Sachedina|1981|pp=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\nHasan al-Askari's estate was divided between his brother Jafar and his mother. Moojan Momen writes: Jafar remained unshakeable in his assertion that his brother (Hasan al-Askari) had no progeny.\"<ref>Momen, Moojan. \"An Introduction to Shi\u2019i Islam\". London, 1985, p.&nbsp;162.</ref> According to Sachadina, \"sources describe Ja'far as a worldly and pleasure-loving man who in order to become the Imam had used various repressive means in the presence of al-Mu'tamid and more than once has tried to slander those who upheld the Imamate of the infant son of al-Askari in concealment.\" <ref name=\"Sachedina 1981 41\">{{harv|Sachedina|1981|p=41}}</ref>\n\nDuring the caliphate of al-Mu'tamid to that of al-Muqtadir, the agents of the dead Imam believed that Hasan al-Askari had left a son who will appear at Allah's will. This group of people were under attack and opposed by others. Al-Mutamid, the Abbasid caliph, ordered to investigate the house of Imam and also to inspect if Imam's wives were pregnant. During these investigations, Narjis was imprisoned for not revealing the place of her baby. In order to promote a dispute within Imam's family, they \"supported Ja'far a brother of al-Askari and claimant to the office of the Imamat\". The situation changed when \"political disturbances caused by the Zanj and provincial leaders in Iran, Egypt and Syria.\" led to the capture of the caliph.<ref name=\"Sachedina 1981 41\"/>\n\nAccording to Jassim M. Hussain, the majority of the Imamites denied his birth or even his existence, and abandoned their belief in the hidden Imam except for a small minority belonging to the circles of narrators, like Ibn Qubba and al-Nu'mani who based their belief on the traditions of the Imams (i.e. Hadith about twelve Imams).

The sense of responsibility for paving the way for the reappearance of Mahdi has also led Shi'as to re-evaluate their social circumstances and the shortcomings of their lives and strive to build their own provisional Islamic government in anticipation of Mahdi's promised rule.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Contemporary influence ===\nThe Shia millennial vision of history continues to be expressed, even today, through radical social protest against political oppression. [[Abdulaziz Sachedina]]<nowiki/> writes: \"Without the deep sense of paving the way for the reappearance of the Imam, the Shi'as would not have felt the need to re-evaluate their social circumstances and the shortcomings of their present lives. Thus, the ghayba (occultation) of the Mahdi has acted as a creative force in their lives that has not only helped them bear with patience the difficult times but also has also prepared them to fulfill their historical responsibility of establishing a true Islamic rule, even before the Imam assumes the leadership of the Shia after his final reappearance.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Messianism.html?id=5zUIYGQT4DwC|title=Islamic Messianism: The Idea of Mahdi in Twelver Shi'ism|last=Sachedina|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|date=1981|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9780873954426|location=|pages=182\u2013183|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Shia Mahdi doctrine was a key element in inspiring the [[1979 Islamic revolution]] in Iran led by [[Ayatollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] who argued as part of his theory of the [[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Rule of the Jurist]] that the highest and most learned Muslim Jurist could legitimately administer the government on a God-given mandate to prepare the world for the return of the Hidden Imam. Khomeini succeeded in using the potent concepts of Shia eschatology and \u200ctheodicy \u2013\u2013 such as the Shia notions of struggle against injustice and worldly oppression \u200c\u2013\u2013 to mobilize the masses towards revolutionary goals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hudson.org/research/9809-is-the-end-nigh-for-the-islamic-republic-|title=Is the End Nigh for the Islamic Republic? \u2013 by Bernd Kaussler|last=Kaussler|first=Bernd|access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIslamic traditions hold that before the ultimate return of the Muslim messiah, his influence manifests itself in the world in different ways. Throughout history, \"a vast and deeply personal literature\" has emerged in the Shia world that apparently exemplifies this influence in form of \"revelations, dreams, healings, visions, and other occurrences all attributed to the Mahdi's personal intervention.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Over the recent years in particular, a growing anticipation of Mahdi's imminent return among the wider public has been identified, leading to spread of widely-available literature about predictions and prophecies concerning Mahdi and his imminent appearance that include great detail on where, when and how Mahdi will appear, overturn the modern order and establish the just state.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, under the influence of the Lebanese resistant organization [[Hezbollah]], literature containing classical traditions as well as interpretations of contemporary events in the light of Mahdi's return have sprang from the Lebanese press. A book including \"miraculous occurrences\" has been published including accounts by Hezbollah fighters on how Mahdi intervened on the battlefields during the [[2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict]] to help them fight against the Israeli army.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother instance of contemporary Shia messianic tendency manifested itself in the discourse and policies of the former Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] who thought that Mahdi's return was imminent. He \"merged messianic rhetoric with populist nationalism\" at home and in his UN speeches he \"combined references to the Mahdi with a blistering [[Third-Worldism|Third-Worldist]] ideological attack on \"[[Imperialism|Western Imperialism]]\" and \"[[Zionism]]\" intended to appeal to some Middle East audiences.\" He and his supporters also sought to depict Iran as \"a chosen nation and a superpower uniquely blessed by the special favors of the Lord of Age\" [Hidden Imam] to lead a global mission against injustice.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn Iraq where many hold deep suspicions of the U.S., there are frequent assertions in the apocalyptic literature claiming that the U.S.-led invasion was aimed at finding and killing the Mahdi as part of an apocalyptic war against the Shia world.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hudson.org/research/7906-messianism-in-the-shiite-crescent|title=Messianism in the Shiite Crescent \u2013 by David Cook|last=Cook|first=David|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Political controversies ====\nOn 3 May 2017, the then-[[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] deputy crown prince [[Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud]], in an interview with [[Middle East Broadcasting Center|MBC]], made repeated references to the Shi'ite ideology of the Iranian state to reject the possibility of dialogue with Iran for settling the regional rivalry between the two countries. He argued that it was impossible to have dialogue with an entity with an \"extremist ideology\" that believes its policies are divinely-guided to prepare conditions for the return of the Imam Mahdi, fearing a spread of Twelver Shi'ite or Iranian influence to the [[Hejaz|land of Islam's holiest shrine]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/20170503/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salmans-warning-to-iran#full|title=Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s warning to Iran {{!}} The National|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]]|access-date=24 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah]] Secretary General of the Iran-backed Lebanese resistance organization [[Hezbollah]] responded to bin Salman's remarks by accusing him of wanting to turn a political struggle in the region into a religious one.

The film centers on Buddy, a human who was adopted and raised by [[Christmas elf|Santa's elves]]. He learns about this and heads to [[New York City]] to meet his biological father while also spreading Christmas cheer in a world of cynics in the process. \n\n''Elf'' was released in the United States on November 7, 2003 by [[New Line Cinema]] to critical and commercial success, grossing $220 million worldwide against a $33 million budget. Ferrell\u2019s performance as Buddy the Elf was praised by audiences and critics alike, with many calling it one of his best performances. It inspired the 2010 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Elf (Broadway musical)|Elf: The Musical]]'' and [[NBC]]'s 2014 [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] animated television special ''[[Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas]]''.

When he is discovered at the [[Santa's workshop|workshop]], the elves name him Buddy after the brand label on his diaper, and Papa Elf adopts and raises him. Buddy grows up at the North Pole, believing he is an elf and accepted by the elf community, but due to his human size, he is unable to keep up with the other elves and demoted to the demeaning job of toy testing. Soon, Buddy overhears that he is a human, and Papa Elf explains that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells and given up for adoption. Susan subsequently died, and Walter, who now works for a children's book publisher at the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]], is unaware of Buddy's existence. To Buddy's horror, Santa reveals that Walter is on the naughty list due to his selfish and unscrupulous demeanor, but suggests Buddy could help redeem him.\n\nBuddy promptly travels to New York and finds his father at work, but even after he mentions Susan Wells, Walter misinterprets him as a dysfunctional [[Singing telegram|christmas-gram]] messenger and has him kicked out of the premises. Inspired by a sarcastic remark from a security guard, Buddy heads to a local [[Gimbels]] department store, where the manager mistakes him for an employee. At the store's Santa Land, he meets Jovie, an unenthusiastic employee with whom he is instantly smitten. After hearing that Santa will be at the store the following day, Buddy jubilantly decorates Santa Land overnight. When Buddy realizes that the Gimbels Santa is not the real Santa, he unmasks him and causes a wild tumult in the store that lands Buddy in jail.\n\nWalter reluctantly bails him out and takes him to a doctor for a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]], which confirms that Buddy is in fact his long-lost son. The doctor convinces Walter to take Buddy home to meet his [[stepmother]] Emily and twelve-year-old [[half-brother]] Michael, believing once he is faced with reality he will drop the \u201celf thing\u201d and move on as a regular adult. Walter and Michael are put off by Buddy's strange behavior, but Emily insists that they care for him until he \"recovers.\" Michael eventually warms up to Buddy after Buddy defends him from a gang of bullies in a snowball fight, and Michael encourages Buddy to ask Jovie on a date, which she accepts. During the date, the two fall in love. \n\nMeanwhile, Walter's company is in trouble after their most recent book fails to sell. Walter's boss, Fulton Greenway, lays down a hard deadline for Walter to have a new book ready by Christmas Eve. In desperation, Walter and his team secure a meeting with best-selling children's author Miles Finch. Buddy interrupts the meeting to boast of his newfound love and mistakes Finch, who has [[dwarfism]], for an elf. Buddy unintentionally insults Finch and pesters him into losing his temper. An angered and insulted Finch attacks Buddy and walks out on Walter, who snaps in anger at Buddy for ruining the meeting and harshly disowns him. Heartbroken, Buddy leaves a note for Walter, Emily, and Michael on an [[Etch A Sketch]] and wanders about in the streets, lamenting that he does not fit in anywhere.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, after finding Finch's notebook full of ideas, Walter and his team scramble to create a book to pitch. As Walter prepares to pitch the book to Greenway that evening, Michael, who found Buddy's note, arrives and informs Walter that Buddy is gone. Realizing he was wrong and forced to choose between his job or his family, Walter confronts Greenway and despite being fired, leaves with Michael to find Buddy.\n\nAs Buddy wanders the streets, he watches Santa's sleigh crash in [[Central Park]], attracting a large crowd. Buddy tracks down Santa, who explains that the sleigh has lost its engine and cannot fly without it due to a shortage of Christmas spirit. Buddy finds the engine and is reunited with Walter and Michael. Walter apologizes to Buddy and accepts him as his son. Buddy then takes them to meet Santa, who proves himself to Michael by showing him what he truly wanted for Christmas. Michael takes Santa's list and reads it in front of television news cameras gathered outside the park, proving that Santa Claus is real. The Central Park Rangers, who have a grudge against Santa for placing them on the naughty list, chase the sleigh as Buddy tries to reattach the engine. Jovie leads the crowd in singing \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]],\" helping raise enough Christmas spirit to fully power the sleigh without the engine for the first time in years.\n\nBy the next Christmas, Walter starts his own publishing company with a best-selling book about Buddy's adventures.

The film centers on Buddy, a human who was adopted and raised by [[Christmas elf|Santa's elves]]. He learns about this and heads to [[New York City]] to meet his biological father while also spreading Christmas cheer in a world of cynics in the process. \n\n''Elf'' was released in the United States on November 7, 2003 by [[New Line Cinema]] to critical and commercial success, grossing $220 million worldwide against a $33 million budget. Ferrell\u2019s performance as Buddy the Elf was praised by audiences and critics alike, with many calling it one of his best performances. It inspired the 2010 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Elf (Broadway musical)|Elf: The Musical]]'' and [[NBC]]'s 2014 [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] animated television special ''[[Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas]]''. It is often listed among the greatest Christmas films of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetoptens.com/top-christmas-movies/|title=Top Ten Christmas Movies Of All Time |website=Thetoptens.com|access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-christmas-movies/|title=The 50 Best Christmas Movies of All Time|language=en-US|access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-christmas-movies-of-all-time|title=The 50 Best Christmas Movies of All Time|last=Patches|first=Dan Jackson, Matt|date=December 22, 2017|website=Thrillist|access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP: FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], a baby boy at an [[orphanage]] crawls into [[Santa Claus]]'s sack as he is captivated by the sight of a [[teddy bear]], and is unwittingly transported back to the North Pole. When he is discovered at the [[Santa's workshop|workshop]], the elves name him Buddy after the brand label on his diaper, and Papa Elf adopts and raises him. Buddy grows up at the North Pole, believing he is an elf and accepted by the elf community, but due to his human size, he is unable to keep up with the other elves and demoted to the demeaning job of toy testing. Soon, Buddy overhears that he is a human, and Papa Elf explains that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells and given up for adoption. Susan subsequently died, and Walter, who now works for a children's book publisher at the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]], is unaware of Buddy's existence. To Buddy's horror, Santa reveals that Walter is on the naughty list due to his selfish and unscrupulous demeanor, but suggests Buddy could help redeem him.\n\nBuddy promptly travels to New York and finds his father at work, but even after he mentions Susan Wells, Walter misinterprets him as a dysfunctional [[Singing telegram|christmas-gram]] messenger and has him kicked out of the premises. Inspired by a sarcastic remark from a security guard, Buddy heads to a local [[Gimbels]] department store, where the manager mistakes him for an employee. At the store's Santa Land, he meets Jovie, an unenthusiastic employee with whom he is instantly smitten. After hearing that Santa will be at the store the following day, Buddy jubilantly decorates Santa Land overnight. When Buddy realizes that the Gimbels Santa is not the real Santa, he unmasks him and causes a wild tumult in the store that lands Buddy in jail.\n\nWalter reluctantly bails him out and takes him to a doctor for a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]], which confirms that Buddy is in fact his long-lost son. The doctor convinces Walter to take Buddy home to meet his [[stepmother]] Emily and twelve-year-old [[half-brother]] Michael, believing once he is faced with reality he will drop the \u201celf thing\u201d and move on as a regular adult. Walter and Michael are put off by Buddy's strange behavior, but Emily insists that they care for him until he \"recovers.\" Michael eventually warms up to Buddy after Buddy defends him from a gang of bullies in a snowball fight, and Michael encourages Buddy to ask Jovie on a date, which she accepts. During the date, the two fall in love. \n\nMeanwhile, Walter's company is in trouble after their most recent book fails to sell. Walter's boss, Fulton Greenway, lays down a hard deadline for Walter to have a new book ready by Christmas Eve. In desperation, Walter and his team secure a meeting with best-selling children's author Miles Finch. Buddy interrupts the meeting to boast of his newfound love and mistakes Finch, who has [[dwarfism]], for an elf. Buddy unintentionally insults Finch and pesters him into losing his temper. An angered and insulted Finch attacks Buddy and walks out on Walter, who snaps in anger at Buddy for ruining the meeting and harshly disowns him. Heartbroken, Buddy leaves a note for Walter, Emily, and Michael on an [[Etch A Sketch]] and wanders about in the streets, lamenting that he does not fit in anywhere.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, after finding Finch's notebook full of ideas, Walter and his team scramble to create a book to pitch. As Walter prepares to pitch the book to Greenway that evening, Michael, who found Buddy's note, arrives and informs Walter that Buddy is gone. Realizing he was wrong and forced to choose between his job or his family, Walter confronts Greenway and despite being fired, leaves with Michael to find Buddy.\n\nAs Buddy wanders the streets, he watches Santa's sleigh crash in [[Central Park]], attracting a large crowd. Buddy tracks down Santa, who explains that the sleigh has lost its engine and cannot fly without it due to a shortage of Christmas spirit. Buddy finds the engine and is reunited with Walter and Michael. Walter apologizes to Buddy and accepts him as his son. Buddy then takes them to meet Santa, who proves himself to Michael by showing him what he truly wanted for Christmas. Michael takes Santa's list and reads it in front of television news cameras gathered outside the park, proving that Santa Claus is real. The Central Park Rangers, who have a grudge against Santa for placing them on the naughty list, chase the sleigh as Buddy tries to reattach the engine. Jovie leads the crowd in singing \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]],\" helping raise enough Christmas spirit to fully power the sleigh without the engine for the first time in years.\n\nBy the next Christmas, Walter starts his own publishing company with a best-selling book about Buddy's adventures. Buddy and Jovie, now married, bring their newborn daughter Susie to visit Papa Elf.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Buddy Hobbs, aka \"Buddy the Elf\", an eccentric human who was raised by Santa's elves.\n* [[James Caan]] as Walter Hobbs, a children's book publisher and Buddy's biological father.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Jovie, an unenthusiastic worker at [[Gimbels]] and Buddy's love interest.\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Emily Hobbs, Walter's wife, Michael's mother and Buddy's stepmother.\n* [[Daniel Tay]] as Michael Hobbs, Walter and Emily's son and Buddy's younger half brother.\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as Papa Elf, Buddy\u2019s adoptive father.\n* [[Ed Asner]] as [[Santa Claus]], who finds Buddy in his sack and gives him to Papa Elf to raise.\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Wanda, the manager of Gimbels and Jovie's boss.\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Miles Finch, a best-selling children's author who attacks Buddy for (mistakenly) calling him an elf.\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Deb, Walter Hobbs' secretary.\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Mr. Greenway, Walter Hobbs' controlling and uncaring boss, the CEO of Greenway Press.\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Morris, an associate of Walter Hobbs.\n* [[Kyle Gass]] as Eugene Dupree, an associate of Walter Hobbs.\n* [[Artie Lange]] as the Fake Santa, a Mall Santa who Buddy gets into an altercation with due to him not being the real Santa Claus.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Dr. Ben Leonardo, the Hobbs family's [[pediatrician]].\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] as Eye Witness.\n* [[Peter Billingsley]] as Ming Ming (uncredited), the head elf of their workshop.\n* [[Mark Acheson]] as a mailroom worker.\n* [[David Paul Grove]] as Pom Pom, an elf who Buddy faints on when he discovers he's a human.\n* Claire Lautier as Charlotte Dennon, NY 1 Reporter.\n* Jane Bradbury as Susan Wells.

The baby boomers became the largest voting demographic in the early 1980s and helped to propel President Reagan into power, a period which ushered in a long running trend of rapidly increasing income inequality. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Bowman|first=Karlyn|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/12/opinion/la-oe-bowman-baby-boomers-more-conservative-20110912|title=As the boomers turn|date=2011-09-12|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1979-2007, those receiving the highest 1 percentile of incomes saw their already large incomes increase by 278% while those in the middle at the 40th-60th percentiles saw a 35% increase.

Citing Wade Clark Roof, a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of California]] at [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], the articles stated that about 42% of baby boomers were dropouts from formal religion, 33% had never strayed from church, and 25% of boomers were returning to religious practice. \n\nThe boomers returning to religion were \"usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists.

A [[Video game remake|Re-Imagining]] of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|''Resident Evil 2'']], it was released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and student [[Claire Redfield]] as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a [[zombie apocalypse]].  \n\nCapcom considered remaking ''Resident Evil 2'' following the successful release of [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|the remake of the first ''Resident Evil'']] in 2002. It was delayed as series creator [[Shinji Mikami]] did not want to divert development from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005). Capcom announced the ''Resident Evil 2'' remake in August 2015, and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at [[E3 2018]].\n\n''Resident Evil 2'' received acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous [[game of the year|\"game of the year]]\" awards. By December 2019, it had sold over 5.8 million copies, outselling the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 Remake gameplay.png|left|thumb|[[Claire Redfield]] is one of the game's two main playable characters.]]\n''Resident Evil 2'' is a re-imagining of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|of the same name]]. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the re-imagining features \"over-the-shoulder\" [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to ''[[Resident Evil&nbsp;4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|title=E3 2018: Resident Evil 2 Re-imagining Is Familiar But Terrifying In New Ways|last=Espineli|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084807/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the standard difficulty mode allows players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.\n\nAs with the original game, the re-imagining of ''Resident Evil 2'' offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, the rookie cop [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or the college student [[Claire Redfield]]. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.\n\nSimilar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe game is set in Raccoon City in September 1998, two months after the events of ''[[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Most of the citizens have been turned into mindless creatures, referred to by survivors as zombies, due to an outbreak of a viral [[bioweapon]] known as the [[T-Virus]], manufactured by [[Umbrella Corporation]].<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|pages=117\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|page=253}}</ref> The game begins at a [[gas station]] outside of the city, where rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] meets college student [[Claire Redfield]], who is looking for her brother [[Chris Redfield]].\n\nAfter being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the city's police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters, including the \"[[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]\",{{efn|Officially known as T-00, but commonly referred to as \"Mr. X\".}} who is dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find a way to escape the city.\n\n=== Claire scenario ===\nClaire encounters a young girl, Sherry Birkin, who is being pursued by a monstrous creature. The two manage to escape into the police station parking garage, where corrupt Police Chief Brian Irons abducts Sherry, and locks her in an abandoned orphanage. Claire soon receives a call from Irons to trade Sherry for a pendant she had dropped during the abduction, threatening to kill the little girl if Claire does not comply. Reluctantly, Claire agrees to do so.\n\nSherry tries to escape on her own, but is soon cornered by Irons. Before Irons can harm her, the creature that had been chasing Sherry returns and implants Irons with a parasite. Claire arrives to save Sherry, and the parasite bursts out of Irons' chest, killing him. As Claire and Sherry attempt to leave, the Tyrant arrives and chases the pair into an elevator, but is killed by the creature stalking Sherry. The creature then tries to attack Claire and Sherry, but accidentally causes the elevator to fall into the sewers. The resulting impact knocks Claire unconscious, and Sherry is forced to abandon her to escape.\n\nClaire is found by Annette, Sherry's mother. Annette reveals that the creature after Sherry is William, her husband. The Birkins developed the G-Virus for Umbrella; however, William planned to sell it to the U.S. military. Umbrella sent its paramilitary force to confiscate his work, leading to William being fatally shot. To avoid death and vowing revenge, William had injected himself with the G-Virus. The infected William hunted down the Umbrella soldiers in the sewers. During the carnage he shattered vials of the T-virus the troops had taken, infecting sewer rats and indirectly causing the Raccoon City outbreak. Now a mindless mutating beast, the G-Virus drives William to infect Sherry, as she is the closest genetic match to William and thus the most suitable host to spread the infection.\n\nClaire finds Sherry trapped in a trash compactor by Annette. Upon reaching her, however, Sherry falls ill. Annette realizes William has already infected Sherry and has Claire bring her to an Umbrella lab called NEST, where a vaccine is stored. Once there, Claire uses Sherry's pendant to unlock the vaccine, but William attacks. Claire sends Annette to administer the vaccine while she fights William. After seemingly killing him, Claire reunites with Annette, who has managed to cure Sherry before dying from internal injuries. Sherry tearfully bids her mother goodbye. As the facility enacts a self-destruct protocol, Claire and Sherry make their way to an evacuation train. William returns yet again, and Claire defeats him just as the train prepares to leave. Upon boarding, Claire discovers Leon there as well.\n\n=== Leon scenario ===\nLeon is saved from an infected dog by FBI agent, [[Ada Wong]]. They find reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells; imprisoned by Irons for investigating Umbrella. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant kills Ben. While attempting to escape the police station, Leon is intercepted by the Tyrant but is again saved by Ada. Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve a G-Virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.\n\nIn the sewers, Annette Birkin ambushes the pair and shoots at Ada; Leon takes the bullet and passes out. Ada pursues Annette but is knocked into a trash compactor. Leon rescues her, and they descend to NEST via cable car, where Ada kisses Leon.\n\nAda, injured, requests that Leon obtain the G sample. In Birkin's lab, Leon obtains a sample but is attacked by William. Annette tries to kill him, but is mortally wounded. Leon defeats William and tends to Annette, who claims that Ada is a mercenary and will sell the virus to the highest bidder.\n\nLeon confronts Ada as the lab's self-destruct protocol begins, where she admits to being a mercenary. Ada demands the G-Virus sample from Leon at gunpoint, but Annette shoots Ada before succumbing to her injuries. As Ada falls off the bridge; Leon catches her, letting the virus sample fall into the abyss. Leon loses his grip and Ada falls.\n\nAs Leon attempts to escape the lab, he is ambushed by the Tyrant, now transformed into the larger and more powerful Super Tyrant and engages it in a final battle. Ada, having survived the fall, tosses a rocket launcher to him, which Leon uses to finally destroy the Super Tyrant. Leon boards the evacuation train, discovering Claire and Sherry already aboard.\n\n=== Ending ===\nAfter Leon, Claire, and Sherry reunite, William attacks the train, having mutated into a gigantic putrid mass of fangs and flesh. Claire and Leon are almost killed in the fight, but manage to uncouple the carriage occupied by William.

A [[Video game remake|Re-Imagining]] of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|''Resident Evil 2'']], it was released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and student [[Claire Redfield]] as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a [[zombie apocalypse]].  \n\nCapcom considered remaking ''Resident Evil 2'' following the successful release of [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|the remake of the first ''Resident Evil'']] in 2002. It was delayed as series creator [[Shinji Mikami]] did not want to divert development from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005). Capcom announced the ''Resident Evil 2'' remake in August 2015, and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at [[E3 2018]].\n\n''Resident Evil 2'' received acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous [[game of the year|\"game of the year]]\" awards. By December 2019, it had sold over 5.8 million copies, outselling the original. All of the official pages by Cacpcom state \" The Survival Horror Classic Re-imagined\" which is why they removed remake from the title.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 Remake gameplay.png|left|thumb|[[Claire Redfield]] is one of the game's two main playable characters.]]\n''Resident Evil 2'' is a re-imagining of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|of the same name]]. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the re-imagining features \"over-the-shoulder\" [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to ''[[Resident Evil&nbsp;4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|title=E3 2018: Resident Evil 2 Re-imagining Is Familiar But Terrifying In New Ways|last=Espineli|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084807/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the standard difficulty mode allows players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.\n\nAs with the original game, the re-imagining of ''Resident Evil 2'' offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, the rookie cop [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or the college student [[Claire Redfield]]. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.\n\nSimilar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe game is set in Raccoon City in September 1998, two months after the events of ''[[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Most of the citizens have been turned into mindless creatures, referred to by survivors as zombies, due to an outbreak of a viral [[bioweapon]] known as the [[T-Virus]], manufactured by [[Umbrella Corporation]].<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|pages=117\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|page=253}}</ref> The game begins at a [[gas station]] outside of the city, where rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] meets college student [[Claire Redfield]], who is looking for her brother [[Chris Redfield]].\n\nAfter being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the city's police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters, including the \"[[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]\",{{efn|Officially known as T-00, but commonly referred to as \"Mr. X\".}} who is dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find a way to escape the city.\n\n=== Claire scenario ===\nClaire encounters a young girl, Sherry Birkin, who is being pursued by a monstrous creature. The two manage to escape into the police station parking garage, where corrupt Police Chief Brian Irons abducts Sherry, and locks her in an abandoned orphanage. Claire soon receives a call from Irons to trade Sherry for a pendant she had dropped during the abduction, threatening to kill the little girl if Claire does not comply. Reluctantly, Claire agrees to do so.\n\nSherry tries to escape on her own, but is soon cornered by Irons. Before Irons can harm her, the creature that had been chasing Sherry returns and implants Irons with a parasite. Claire arrives to save Sherry, and the parasite bursts out of Irons' chest, killing him. As Claire and Sherry attempt to leave, the Tyrant arrives and chases the pair into an elevator, but is killed by the creature stalking Sherry. The creature then tries to attack Claire and Sherry, but accidentally causes the elevator to fall into the sewers. The resulting impact knocks Claire unconscious, and Sherry is forced to abandon her to escape.\n\nClaire is found by Annette, Sherry's mother. Annette reveals that the creature after Sherry is William, her husband. The Birkins developed the G-Virus for Umbrella; however, William planned to sell it to the U.S. military. Umbrella sent its paramilitary force to confiscate his work, leading to William being fatally shot. To avoid death and vowing revenge, William had injected himself with the G-Virus. The infected William hunted down the Umbrella soldiers in the sewers. During the carnage he shattered vials of the T-virus the troops had taken, infecting sewer rats and indirectly causing the Raccoon City outbreak. Now a mindless mutating beast, the G-Virus drives William to infect Sherry, as she is the closest genetic match to William and thus the most suitable host to spread the infection.\n\nClaire finds Sherry trapped in a trash compactor by Annette. Upon reaching her, however, Sherry falls ill. Annette realizes William has already infected Sherry and has Claire bring her to an Umbrella lab called NEST, where a vaccine is stored. Once there, Claire uses Sherry's pendant to unlock the vaccine, but William attacks. Claire sends Annette to administer the vaccine while she fights William. After seemingly killing him, Claire reunites with Annette, who has managed to cure Sherry before dying from internal injuries. Sherry tearfully bids her mother goodbye. As the facility enacts a self-destruct protocol, Claire and Sherry make their way to an evacuation train. William returns yet again, and Claire defeats him just as the train prepares to leave. Upon boarding, Claire discovers Leon there as well.\n\n=== Leon scenario ===\nLeon is saved from an infected dog by FBI agent, [[Ada Wong]]. They find reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells; imprisoned by Irons for investigating Umbrella. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant kills Ben. While attempting to escape the police station, Leon is intercepted by the Tyrant but is again saved by Ada. Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve a G-Virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.\n\nIn the sewers, Annette Birkin ambushes the pair and shoots at Ada; Leon takes the bullet and passes out. Ada pursues Annette but is knocked into a trash compactor. Leon rescues her, and they descend to NEST via cable car, where Ada kisses Leon.\n\nAda, injured, requests that Leon obtain the G sample. In Birkin's lab, Leon obtains a sample but is attacked by William. Annette tries to kill him, but is mortally wounded. Leon defeats William and tends to Annette, who claims that Ada is a mercenary and will sell the virus to the highest bidder.\n\nLeon confronts Ada as the lab's self-destruct protocol begins, where she admits to being a mercenary. Ada demands the G-Virus sample from Leon at gunpoint, but Annette shoots Ada before succumbing to her injuries. As Ada falls off the bridge; Leon catches her, letting the virus sample fall into the abyss. Leon loses his grip and Ada falls.\n\nAs Leon attempts to escape the lab, he is ambushed by the Tyrant, now transformed into the larger and more powerful Super Tyrant and engages it in a final battle. Ada, having survived the fall, tosses a rocket launcher to him, which Leon uses to finally destroy the Super Tyrant. Leon boards the evacuation train, discovering Claire and Sherry already aboard.\n\n=== Ending ===\nAfter Leon, Claire, and Sherry reunite, William attacks the train, having mutated into a gigantic putrid mass of fangs and flesh. Claire and Leon are almost killed in the fight, but manage to uncouple the carriage occupied by William. The carriage falls behind and is consumed by the exploding lab, destroying William once and for all. As the three survivors finally escape Raccoon City, they vow to continue the fight against Umbrella.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 police car at E3 2018.jpg|thumb|Promotional booth at [[E3 2018]]]]\nThe original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' was released for the PlayStation in 1998.

Division was ordered into federal service on 23 December 1940 at home stations. The division's units were ordered to report to Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas, and had arrived by the end of January, 1941. The incomplete ranks of the 35th were swelled by thousands of [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|draftees]], a large portion of whom, through the allowance of local recruitment while National Guard divisions were increasing their strength, were ordered to join the division from the states where the division's units had originated. After completing the [[War Department]]-mandated divisional training program, the 35th Division maneuvered against other units in Arkansas and Louisiana in the fall of 1941. After the Pearl Harbor attack came its first assignment, the defense of the Southern California Sector of the [[Western Defense Command]].\n\n====Reorganization====\n\nOn 3 February 1942, the 35th Division was \"triangularized,\" losing its infantry and field artillery brigade headquarters. The 138th Infantry Regiment departed, assigned to [[Army Ground Forces|GHQ]]. The 35th Division's engineer, field artillery, quartermaster, and medical regiments were reorganized as battalions. On 27 January 1943, the 140th Infantry Regiment was relieved from the division, and was replaced by the 320th Infantry Regiment on 26 January 1943. \n\n===Further training===\n\nThe newly-christened 35th Infantry Division departed California for [[Fort Rucker|Camp Rucker]], [[Alabama]], arriving on 1 April 1943. After participating in the [[Second United States Army|Second Army]] Tennessee Maneuvers from 22 November 1943 to 17 January 1944 and receiving mountain warfare training at the [[West Virginia Maneuver Area]] from 21 February to 28 March 1944, the 35th Infantry Division was declared ready for overseas service. Further movement to Camp Butner, North Carolina, and Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, saw the division through to England, where it arrived on 25 May 1944.\n\n===Commanders===\n* Major General [[Ralph E.

It landed on [[Omaha Beach]], [[Normandy]] 5\u20137 July 1944 and entered combat on 11 July, fighting in the Normandy hedgerows north of [[Saint-L\u00f4|St. Lo]]. The division beat off twelve [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] counterattacks at Emelie before entering St. Lo on 18 July. After mopping up in the St. Lo area, it took part in the offensive action southwest of St. Lo, pushing the Germans across the [[Vire River]] on 2 August, and breaking out of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. While en route to an assembly area, the division was \"flagged off the road,\" to secure the [[Mortain]]-[[Avranches]] corridor and to rescue the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Division's]] \"Lost Battalion\" August 7\u201313, 1944.\n\nThen racing across France through [[Orl\u00e9ans|Orleans]] and [[Sens]], the division attacked across the [[Moselle]] on 13 September, captured [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] on 15 September, secured [[Chambrey]] on 1 October, and drove on to the German border, taking [[Sarreguemines]] and crossing the [[Saar (river)|Saar]] on 8 December. After crossing the [[Blies|Blies River]] on 12 December, the division moved to [[Metz]] for rest and rehabilitation on 19 December. The 35th moved to [[Arlon]], [[Belgium]] December 25\u201326, and took part in the fighting to relieve [[Bastogne]], throwing off the attacks of four German divisions, taking [[Bastogne|Villers-laBonne-Eau]] on 10 January, after a 13-day fight and [[Bastogne|Lutrebois]] in a 5-day engagement. On 18 January 1945, the division returned to Metz to resume its interrupted rest.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn late January, the division was defending the [[National forest (France)|Foret de Domaniale]] area. Moving to the [[Netherlands]] to hold a defensive line along the [[Rur|Roer]] on 22 February, the division attacked across the Roer on 23 February, pierced the [[Siegfried Line]], reached the [[Rhine]] at [[Wesel]] on 10 March, and crossed 25\u201326 March. It smashed across the [[Rhine\u2013Herne Canal|Herne Canal]] and reached the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr River]] early in April, when it was ordered to move to the [[Elbe]] April 12. Making the 295-mile dash in two days, the 35th mopped up in the vicinity of [[Colbitz]] and [[Angern]], until 26 April 1945 when it moved to [[Hanover]] for occupational and mopping-up duty, continuing occupation beyond [[Victory in Europe Day|VE-day]].

Division was ordered into federal service on 23 December 1940 at home stations. The division's units were ordered to report to Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas, and had arrived by the end of January, 1941. The incomplete ranks of the 35th were swelled by thousands of [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|draftees]], a large portion of whom, through the allowance of local recruitment while National Guard divisions were increasing their strength, were ordered to join the division from the states where the division's units had originated. After completing the [[War Department]]-mandated divisional training program, the 35th Division maneuvered against other units in Arkansas and Louisiana in the fall of 1941. After the Pearl Harbor attack came its first assignment, the defense of the Southern California Sector of the [[Western Defense Command]].\n\n====Reorganization====\n\nOn 3 February 1942, the 35th Division was \"triangularized,\" losing its infantry and field artillery brigade headquarters. The 138th Infantry Regiment departed, assigned to [[Army Ground Forces|GHQ]]. The 35th Division's engineer, field artillery, quartermaster, and medical regiments were reorganized as battalions. On 27 January 1943, the 140th Infantry Regiment was relieved from the division, and was replaced by the 320th Infantry Regiment on 26 January 1943. \n\n===Further training===\n\nThe newly-christened 35th Infantry Division departed California for [[Fort Rucker|Camp Rucker]], [[Alabama]], arriving on 1 April 1943. After participating in the [[Second United States Army|Second Army]] Tennessee Maneuvers from 22 November 1943 to 17 January 1944 and receiving mountain warfare training at the [[West Virginia Maneuver Area]] from 21 February to 28 March 1944, the 35th Infantry Division was declared ready for overseas service. Further movement to Camp Butner, North Carolina, and Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, saw the division through to England, where it arrived on 25 May 1944.\n\n===Commanders===\n* Major General [[Ralph E. Truman]] (December 1940 \u2013 October 1941)\n* Major General [[William H.

It landed on [[Omaha Beach]], [[Normandy]] 5\u20137 July 1944 and entered combat on 11 July, fighting in the Normandy hedgerows north of [[Saint-L\u00f4|St. Lo]]. The division beat off twelve [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] counterattacks at Emelie before entering St. Lo on 18 July. After mopping up in the St. Lo area, it took part in the offensive action southwest of St. Lo, pushing the Germans across the [[Vire River]] on 2 August, and breaking out of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. While en route to an assembly area, the division was \"flagged off the road,\" to secure the [[Mortain]]-[[Avranches]] corridor and to rescue the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Division's]] \"Lost Battalion\" August 7\u201313, 1944.\n\nThen racing across France through [[Orl\u00e9ans|Orleans]] and [[Sens]], the division attacked across the [[Moselle]] on 13 September, captured [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] on 15 September, secured [[Chambrey]] on 1 October, and drove on to the German border, taking [[Sarreguemines]] and crossing the [[Saar (river)|Saar]] on 8 December. After crossing the [[Blies|Blies River]] on 12 December, the division moved to [[Metz]] for rest and rehabilitation on 19 December. The 35th moved to [[Arlon]], [[Belgium]] December 25\u201326, and took part in the fighting to relieve [[Bastogne]], throwing off the attacks of four German divisions, taking [[Bastogne|Villers-laBonne-Eau]] on 10 January, after a 13-day fight and [[Bastogne|Lutrebois]] in a 5-day engagement. On 18 January 1945, the division returned to Metz to resume its interrupted rest.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn late January, the division was defending the [[National forest (France)|Foret de Domaniale]] area. Moving to the [[Netherlands]] to hold a defensive line along the [[Rur|Roer]] on 22 February, the division attacked across the Roer on 23 February, pierced the [[Siegfried Line]], reached the [[Rhine]] at [[Wesel]] on 10 March, and crossed 25\u201326 March. It smashed across the [[Rhine\u2013Herne Canal|Herne Canal]] and reached the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr River]] early in April, when it was ordered to move to the [[Elbe]] April 12. Making the 295-mile dash in two days, the 35th mopped up in the vicinity of [[Colbitz]] and [[Angern]], until 26 April 1945 when it moved to [[Hanover]] for occupational and mopping-up duty, continuing occupation beyond [[Victory in Europe Day|VE-day]].

The Christian Socialist Movement, since 2013 known as [[Christians on the Left]], is one formal group.{{sfn|Leech|2000|pp=677\u2013678}}\n\nOther earlier figures are also viewed as Christian socialists, such as the nineteenth century writers [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] (''The Kingdom of Christ'', 1838), [[John Ruskin]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'', 1862), [[Charles Kingsley]] ([[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|''The Water-Babies'']], 1863), [[Thomas Hughes]] (''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', 1857), [[Frederick James Furnivall]] (co-creator of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), [[Adin Ballou]] (''Practical Christian Socialism'', 1854), and [[Francis Bellamy]] (a [[Baptist]] minister and the author of the United States' [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Biblical age===\nElements that would form the basis of Christian socialism are found in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}\n\n====Old Testament====\nThe Old Testament had divided perspectives on the issue of poverty. One part of the Jewish tradition held that poverty was judgment of God upon the wicked while viewing prosperity as a reward for the good, stating that \"The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want\" (Prov. 13:25).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=20}}\n\nHowever, there are other sections that instruct generosity to the \"have nots\" of society. The [[Torah]] instructs followers to treat neighbours equally and to be generous to have nots, such as stating:\n{{quote|You shall not oppress your neighbour...but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord|([[Book of Leviticus|Lev]] 19:13, 18).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=21}}}}\n{{quote|He [the [[God in Christianity|Lord]] your God] executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojourner therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt|(Deut. 10:18\u201319).{{sfn|Cort|1988}}}}\n{{quote|When you reap in your harvest in the field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it...When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again...When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I command you to do this|([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deut]]. 24:19\u201322).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}}}\n\nSome of the [[Psalms]] include many references to [[social justice]] for the poor:\n{{quote|''Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked''|(Ps. 82 (81): 3, 4).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n{{quote|''Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in his commandments!...He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honour''|(Ps. 112 (111): 1, 9).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n\n[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] emphasizes the need for \"justice\" and \"righteousness\" that is described as conduct that emphasizes love for those who are poor and to oppose oppression and injustice towards the poor.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}} The prophet [[Isaiah]] (759\u2013694 B.C.) to whom is attributed the first thirty-nine chapters of the [[Book of Isaiah]] (\"Proto-Isaiah\"), followed upon Amos' themes of justice and righteousness involving the poor as necessary for followers of God, denouncing those who do not do these things, stating:\n{{quote|''Even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood...cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow''|(Isa. 1:15\u201317).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}}}}\n\nThe [[Book of Sirach]], one of the [[Deuterocanonical]] or [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal]] books of the Old Testament, denounces the pursuit of wealth, stating:\n{{quote|''He who loves gold will not be justified, and he who pursues money will be led astray by it. Many have come to ruin because of gold, and their destruction has met them face to face. It is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it, and every fool will be taken captive by it''|(Sir. 31: 5\u20137).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=28}}}}\n\n====New Testament====\nIn the New Testament, [[Jesus]] in Matthew 25:31\u201346 identifies himself with the hungry, the poor, the sick, and the prisoners.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Matthew 25:31\u201346 is a major component of Christianity and is considered the cornerstone of Christian socialism.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Another key statement in the New Testament that is an important component of Christian socialism is Luke 10:25\u201337 that follows the statement \"You shall love your neighbour as yourself\" with the question \"And who is my neighbour?\", and in the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] Jesus gives the revolutionary response that the neighbour includes anyone in need, even people we might be expected to shun.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}} (The [[Samaritans]] were considered a heretical sect by Jews and neither would usually deal with the other.){{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}}\n\n[[Image:Giovanni Paolo Pannini 001.jpg|thumb|right|400px|\"Jesus Expels the Moneylenders from the Temple\" by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]]]]\nIn the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus says, \"Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied\" (Luke 6:20, 21).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=37}}\n\nChristian socialists note that [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the brother of Jesus of Nazareth, in the [[Epistle of James]] criticizes the rich intensely and in strong language:\n{{Quote|Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up for treasure for the last days. Behold, the wages of the labourers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter|(Jam. 5:1\u20136).{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=41\u201342}}}}\n\nDuring the New Testament period and beyond, there is evidence that many Christian communities practiced forms of sharing, redistribution and communism.{{sfn|Montero|2017}}\n\n===Church Fathers age===\n[[Basil of Caesarea]] (c. 330\u2013379), the [[Church Fathers|Father]] of the Eastern monks who became [[Bishop of Caesarea]], established a complex around the church and monastery that included hostels, almshouses, and hospitals for infectious diseases.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} During the great famine of 368, Basil denounced against profiteers and the indifferent rich.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} Basil wrote the sermon on ''The Rich Fool'' in which he states:\n{{quote|Who is the covetous man? One for whom plenty is not enough. Who is the defrauder? One who takes away what belongs to everyone. And are not you covetous, are you not a defrauder, when you keep for private use what you were given for distribution? When some one strips a man of his clothes we call him a thief. And one who might clothe the naked and does not\u2014should not he be given the same name? The bread in your hoard belongs to the hungry; the cloak in your wardrobe belongs to the naked; the shoes you let rot belong to the barefoot; the money in your vaults belongs to the destitute. All you might help and do not\u2014to all these you are doing wrong{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=43\u201344}}}}\n\n[[John Chrysostom]] declared his reasons for his attitude towards the rich and position of attitude towards wealth by saying:\n{{quote|I am often reproached for continually attacking the rich. Yes, because the rich are continually attacking the poor. But those I attack are not the rich as such, only those who misuse their wealth. I point out constantly that those I accuse are not the rich, but the rapacious; wealth is one thing, covetousness another. Learn to distinguish.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=45}}}}\n\n===19th century to present===\nA variety of socialist perspectives emerged in 19th century Britain, beginning with [[John Ruskin]].\n\n====John Ruskin====\nThe influential [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art critic [[John Ruskin]] expounded theories about social justice in ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860). In it, he stated four goals that might be called \"socialist\" although Ruskin did not use the term.{{sfn|Ruskin|1872|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}\n# \"training schools for youth, established at government cost\"\n# in connection with these schools, the government should establish \"manufactories and workshops, for the production and sale of every necessary of life\"\n# all unemployed people should be \"set to work\" or trained for work if needed or forced to work if necessary\n# \"for the old and destitute, comfort and home should be provided\"\n\nRuskin was not \"an authentic Socialist in any of its various nineteenth-century meanings.\" His only real contact with the Christian Socialists came through the [[Working Men's College]]. However, he influenced later socialist thinking, especially [[William Morris]].{{sfn|Norman|1987|pp=122, 132}}\n\n====Artists====\nThe painters of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] were influenced and sponsored by Ruskin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html |title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction |last=Landow |first=George P. |year=2015 |orig-year=1989 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> The artist [[William Morris]] was a leader of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] founded in December 1884.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/morris/wmsocialm.html |title=Morris's Socialism |last=Cody |first=David |year=2002 |orig-year=1987 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Fabian Society====\nThe [[Fabian Society]] was founded in the same year; [[Sydney Webb|Sydney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] were among its leading members.

It is a view that the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] compel [[Christians]] to support [[communism]] as the ideal [[social system]].

This opinion was moderated an encyclical issued by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 15 May 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', wherein Pius describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI called upon true socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a matter of clarity and also as a matter of principle. Communists were accused of attempting to overthrow all existing civil society, and Christian socialism, if allied to communism, was deemed to be an [[oxymoron]] because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Pius XI famously wrote at the time that \"no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist\",<ref>{{cite magazine |date=8 July 1957 |title=Socialism & the Vatican |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825096,00.html |url-access=subscription |magazine=Time |volume=70 |issue=2 |page=19 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> yet had clarified that a Catholic was free to vote for the British Labour Party, the UK affiliate of the Socialist International. Nonetheless, prominent Catholic Socialists did exist during Pope Pius XI's era, such as [[Dorothy Day]] of the United States of America, and [[Michael O'Flanagan|Father Michael O'Flanagan]] of Ireland.\n\nPope Benedict XVI addressed the Italian Senate, declaring, \u201cIn many respects democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine; in any case, it contributed toward the formation of a social consciousness.\u201d <ref>https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/without-roots-the-west-relativism-christianity-islam.html</ref>\n\n[[Pope Francis]] has shown sympathy to socialist causes with claims such as that capitalism is \"Terrorism against all of Humanity\"<ref name=\"Knight2016\">{{Cite web |title=Pope Francis: Capitalism is 'Terrorism Against All of Humanity' |last=Knight |first=Nika |work=Common Dreams |date=2 August 2016 |access-date=8 September 2018 |url= https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/08/02/pope-francis-capitalism-terrorism-against-all-humanity |quote=}}</ref> and that \"it is the communists who think like Christians.

One of the pastors in the movement, Jacques Kaltenbach, was also to have a formative influence on [[Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9|Andr\u00e9 Trocm\u00e9]].{{sfn|Chalamet|2013}}\n\nUnder the Vichy regime, which had seen the emergence of other forms of witness (particularly the support of internees in the camps, and aiding Jews to escape), the movement was reborn to tackle the problems of a changing world. It expressed a Christian socialism, more or less in line with the beginning of a new political left. Political activism was very broad and included the denunciation of torture, East\u2013West debate on European integration and taking a stance on the process of decolonization. It facilitated meetings between employers, managers and trade unionists to discern a new economic order.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter the events of [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], Calvinism in France became much more left-wing in its orientation.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\">{{cite magazine |last1=Wells |first1=Paul |date=May 1988 |title=L'\u00c9glise C'est Moi: The French Churches and the 'Me' Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kBtZ5WdrI8C&pg=PA14 |magazine=Third Way |volume=11 |issue=5 |location=London |publisher=Hymns Ancient & Modern |pages=14\u201316 |access-date=4 June 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> One doctrinal text produced in this period, ''Church and Authorities'', was described as Marxist in its orientation.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\"/> Churches now seized for themselves the political and social issues to tackle, such as nuclear power and justice for the Third World.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Social Christianity movement temporarily discontinued and its journal, ''Other Times'', ceased to be published.<ref name=\"France Culture 2010\"/> However, the movement was relaunched on 10 June 2010 with a petition signed by over 240 people<ref name=\"France Culture 2010\"/> and now maintains an active presence with its own website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianismesocial.org |title=Accueil |website=...Se r\u00e9clamant du christianisme social |language=French |trans-title=Welcome |access-date=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, Calvinists have supported capitalism and have been in the vanguard of promoting market capitalism<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite magazine |date=16 April 1998 |title=Prim but Punchy |url=http://www.economist.com/node/160426 |url-access=limited |magazine=The Economist |volume=346 |issue=8064 |page=48 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> and have produced many of France's leading entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"The Economist\"/> With regard to politics and social issues however, they are very much socialists.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\"/> Three of France's post-war prime ministers have been Calvinists, despite Protestants only making up two percent of the population.

Its beginnings may be traced to [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] (1684\u20131761), of Llanddowror, [[Carmarthenshire]], whose sympathy for the poor led him to set on foot a system of circulating charity schools for the education of children.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, until the nineteenth century, the prevailing thought amongst Welsh non-conformists was that \"it would be wiser if the churches limited their activities to those of the altar and not to meddle at all with the state and social questions\". This stemmed partly from the traditional nonconformist belief in the separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=3}}\n\nIn his influential sermon, ''Y Ddwy Alwedigaeth'' (The Two Vocations), [[Emrys ap Iwan]] challenged this passive pietism: \"We must not think, like the old Methodists, Puritans and some Catholics, that we can only seek Godliness outside our earthly vocation.\" He condemned those Christians who limited godliness to directly religious matters such as Sabbath observance and personal devotion. He declared that all earthly things, including language and culture, have some kind of divine origin.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nMany of the founders of the Welsh nationalist social-democratic party, [[Plaid Cymru]] were also devout Calvinists,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} including [[John Edward Daniel]]. Daniel was the theologian credited for bringing neo-orthodoxy to Wales. Daniel argued that God did not create man as an isolated individual but as a social being.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe second generation of Plaid Cymru leaders included [[R. Tudur Jones]]. His political stance, combined with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine, created an integrated vision that was significant to the religious life of Christian Wales in the later half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Davies|Jenkins|Baines|Lynch|2008}} Jones argued that the \"state should be a servant, to preserve order and to allow men to live the good life\".{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=5}}\n\nToday, many Calvinist socialists in Wales support same-sex marriage on the grounds that it delivers marriage equality in the eyes of the state while still allowing churches to follow their own conscience, thus upholding the traditional Protestant belief in separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=7}}\n\nThe Calvinist tradition in Plaid Cymru has also influenced its non-violent approach.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} \"The ideal is no fist violence, no verbal violence, and no heart violence.... Christians... point to the New Testament example of Jesus Christ clearing the temple. Here there is no suggestion of violence against people; rather the tables are turned as a symbolic act. The life and teaching of Jesus Christ were seen as the foundations of nonviolent direct action [for Plaid Cymru members]... loving their enemies on the one hand, but not compromising on what they saw as an issue of moral rightness.\"{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=6}} Plaid Cymru continues to see itself as very much part of the Christian pacifist tradition.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=7}}\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Lawrence Reed]], in ''Rendering Unto Caesar'', writes that Jesus was not a socialist in that he promoted voluntary giving and charity rather than the mandatory taking by government (taxes).{{sfn|Reed|2015}}{{Dubious|Criticism section dubious|date=December 2018}} Johnnie Moore (Professor of Religion at [[Liberty University]]) writing on the homepage of [[Fox News Radio]]'s [[Todd Starnes]], says Jesus was a capitalist.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Moore | first1=Johnnie | title=Was Jesus a Socialist or a Capitalist? | url=http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/was-jesus-a-socialist-or-a-capitalist.html | publisher=Fox News Radio | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230518/http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/was-jesus-a-socialist-or-a-capitalist.html | archive-date=5 October 2016 | url-status=unfit | access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>{{Dubious|Criticism section dubious|date=December 2018}} [[Bryan Fischer]], of the [[American Family Association]], says Jesus was a capitalist who advocated \"''voluntary'' redistribution of wealth\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Bryan|authorlink1=Bryan Fischer|title=Jesus Was Not a Socialist|url=http://www.afa.net/the-stand/bible/2015/10/jesus-was-not-a-socialist/|website=The Stand|publisher=American Family Association|date=15 October 2015|access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>{{Dubious|Criticism section dubious|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] was critical of socialist doctrines, and warned that those who seek socialism \"may soon have too much of it.\"  Specifically, he regarded collectivist Christianity as inferior to faith on an individual level.

The Christian Socialist Movement, since 2013 known as [[Christians on the Left]], is one formal group.{{sfn|Leech|2000|pp=677\u2013678}}\n\nOther earlier figures are also viewed as Christian socialists, such as the nineteenth century writers [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] (''The Kingdom of Christ'', 1838), [[John Ruskin]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'', 1862), [[Charles Kingsley]] ([[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|''The Water-Babies'']], 1863), [[Thomas Hughes]] (''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', 1857), [[Frederick James Furnivall]] (co-creator of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), [[Adin Ballou]] (''Practical Christian Socialism'', 1854), and [[Francis Bellamy]] (a [[Baptist]] minister and the author of the United States' [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Biblical age===\nElements that would form the basis of Christian socialism are found in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}\n\n====Old Testament====\nOld Testament had divided perspectives on the issue of poverty. One part of the Jewish tradition held that poverty was judgment of God upon the wicked while viewing prosperity as a reward for the good, stating that \"The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want\" (Prov. 13:25).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=20}}\n\nHowever, there are other sections that instruct generosity to the \"have nots\" of society. The [[Torah]] instructs followers to treat neighbours equally and to be generous to have nots, such as stating:\n{{quote|You shall not oppress your neighbour...but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord|([[Book of Leviticus|Lev]] 19:13, 18).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=21}}}}\n{{quote|He [the [[God in Christianity|Lord]] your God] executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojourner therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt|(Deut. 10:18\u201319).{{sfn|Cort|1988}}}}\n{{quote|When you reap in your harvest in the field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it...When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again...When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I command you to do this|([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deut]]. 24:19\u201322).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}}}\n\nSome of the [[Psalms]] include many references to [[social justice]] for the poor:\n{{quote|''Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked''|(Ps. 82 (81): 3, 4).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n{{quote|''Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in his commandments!...He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honour''|(Ps. 112 (111): 1, 9).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n\n[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] emphasizes the need for \"justice\" and \"righteousness\" that is described as conduct that emphasizes love for those who are poor and to oppose oppression and injustice towards the poor.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}} The prophet [[Isaiah]] (759\u2013694 B.C.) to whom is attributed the first thirty-nine chapters of the [[Book of Isaiah]] (\"Proto-Isaiah\"), followed upon Amos' themes of justice and righteousness involving the poor as necessary for followers of God, denouncing those who do not do these things, stating:\n{{quote|''Even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood...cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow''|(Isa. 1:15\u201317).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}}}}\n\nThe [[Book of Sirach]], one of the [[Deuterocanonical]] or [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal]] books of the Old Testament, denounces the pursuit of wealth, stating:\n{{quote|''He who loves gold will not be justified, and he who pursues money will be led astray by it. Many have come to ruin because of gold, and their destruction has met them face to face. It is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it, and every fool will be taken captive by it''|(Sir. 31: 5\u20137).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=28}}}}\n\n====New Testament====\nIn the New Testament, [[Jesus]] in Matthew 25:31\u201346 identifies himself with the hungry, the poor, the sick, and the prisoners.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Matthew 25:31\u201346 is a major component of Christianity and is considered the cornerstone of Christian socialism.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Another key statement in the New Testament that is an important component of Christian socialism is Luke 10:25\u201337 that follows the statement \"You shall love your neighbour as yourself\" with the question \"And who is my neighbour?\", and in the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] Jesus gives the revolutionary response that the neighbour includes anyone in need, even people we might be expected to shun.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}} (The [[Samaritans]] were considered a heretical sect by Jews and neither would usually deal with the other.){{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}}\n\n[[Image:Giovanni Paolo Pannini 001.jpg|thumb|right|400px|\"Jesus Expels the Moneylenders from the Temple\" by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]]]]\nIn the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus says, \"Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied\" (Luke 6:20, 21).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=37}}\n\nChristian socialists note that [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the brother of Jesus of Nazareth, in the [[Epistle of James]] criticizes the rich intensely and in strong language:\n{{Quote|Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up for treasure for the last days. Behold, the wages of the labourers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter|(Jam. 5:1\u20136).{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=41\u201342}}}}\n\nDuring the New Testament period and beyond, there is evidence that many Christian communities practiced forms of sharing, redistribution and communism.{{sfn|Montero|2017}}\n\n===Church Fathers age===\n[[Basil of Caesarea]] (c. 330\u2013379), the [[Church Fathers|Father]] of the Eastern monks who became [[Bishop of Caesarea]], established a complex around the church and monastery that included hostels, almshouses, and hospitals for infectious diseases.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} During the great famine of 368, Basil denounced against profiteers and the indifferent rich.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} Basil wrote the sermon on ''The Rich Fool'' in which he states:\n{{quote|Who is the covetous man? One for whom plenty is not enough. Who is the defrauder? One who takes away what belongs to everyone. And are not you covetous, are you not a defrauder, when you keep for private use what you were given for distribution? When some one strips a man of his clothes we call him a thief. And one who might clothe the naked and does not\u2014should not he be given the same name? The bread in your hoard belongs to the hungry; the cloak in your wardrobe belongs to the naked; the shoes you let rot belong to the barefoot; the money in your vaults belongs to the destitute. All you might help and do not\u2014to all these you are doing wrong{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=43\u201344}}}}\n\n[[John Chrysostom]] declared his reasons for his attitude towards the rich and position of attitude towards wealth by saying:\n{{quote|I am often reproached for continually attacking the rich. Yes, because the rich are continually attacking the poor. But those I attack are not the rich as such, only those who misuse their wealth. I point out constantly that those I accuse are not the rich, but the rapacious; wealth is one thing, covetousness another. Learn to distinguish.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=45}}}}\n\n===19th century to present===\nA variety of socialist perspectives emerged in 19th century Britain, beginning with [[John Ruskin]].\n\n====John Ruskin====\nThe influential [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art critic [[John Ruskin]] expounded theories about social justice in ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860). In it, he stated four goals that might be called \"socialist\" although Ruskin did not use the term.{{sfn|Ruskin|1872|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}\n# \"training schools for youth, established at government cost\"\n# in connection with these schools, the government should establish \"manufactories and workshops, for the production and sale of every necessary of life\"\n# all unemployed people should be \"set to work\" or trained for work if needed or forced to work if necessary\n# \"for the old and destitute, comfort and home should be provided\"\n\nRuskin was not \"an authentic Socialist in any of its various nineteenth-century meanings.\" His only real contact with the Christian Socialists came through the [[Working Men's College]]. However, he influenced later socialist thinking, especially [[William Morris]].{{sfn|Norman|1987|pp=122, 132}}\n\n====Artists====\nThe painters of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] were influenced and sponsored by Ruskin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html |title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction |last=Landow |first=George P. |year=2015 |orig-year=1989 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> The artist [[William Morris]] was a leader of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] founded in December 1884.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/morris/wmsocialm.html |title=Morris's Socialism |last=Cody |first=David |year=2002 |orig-year=1987 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Fabian Society====\nThe [[Fabian Society]] was founded in the same year; [[Sydney Webb|Sydney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] were among its leading members.

So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed.<br /> It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right.

This opinion was moderated an encyclical issued by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 15 May 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', wherein Pius describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI called upon true socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a matter of clarity and also as a matter of principle. Communists were accused of attempting to overthrow all existing civil society, and Christian socialism, if allied to communism, was deemed to be an [[oxymoron]] because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Pius XI famously wrote at the time that \"no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist\",<ref>{{cite magazine |date=8 July 1957 |title=Socialism & the Vatican |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825096,00.html |url-access=subscription |magazine=Time |volume=70 |issue=2 |page=19 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> yet had clarified that a Catholic was free to vote for the British Labour Party, the UK affiliate of the Socialist International. Nonetheless, prominent Catholic Socialists did exist during Pope Pius XI's era, such as [[Dorothy Day]] of the United States of America, and [[Michael O'Flanagan|Father Michael O'Flanagan]] of Ireland.\n\nPope Benedict XVI addressed the Italian Senate, declaring, \u201cIn many respects democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine; in any case, it contributed toward the formation of a social consciousness.\u201d <ref>https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/without-roots-the-west-relativism-christianity-islam.html</ref>\n\n[[Pope Francis]] has shown sympathy to socialist causes with claims such as that capitalism is \"Terrorism against all of Humanity\"<ref name=\"Knight2016\">{{Cite web |title=Pope Francis: Capitalism is 'Terrorism Against All of Humanity' |last=Knight |first=Nika |work=Common Dreams |date=2 August 2016 |access-date=8 September 2018 |url= https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/08/02/pope-francis-capitalism-terrorism-against-all-humanity |quote=}}</ref> and that \"it is the communists who think like Christians.

It expressed a Christian socialism, more or less in line with the beginning of a new political left. Political activism was very broad and included the denunciation of torture, East\u2013West debate on European integration and taking a stance on the process of decolonization. It facilitated meetings between employers, managers and trade unionists to discern a new economic order.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter the events of [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], Calvinism in France became much more left-wing in its orientation.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\">{{cite magazine |last1=Wells |first1=Paul |date=May 1988 |title=L'\u00c9glise C'est Moi: The French Churches and the 'Me' Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kBtZ5WdrI8C&pg=PA14 |magazine=Third Way |volume=11 |issue=5 |location=London |publisher=Hymns Ancient & Modern |pages=14\u201316 |access-date=4 June 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> One doctrinal text produced in this period, ''Church and Authorities'', was described as Marxist in its orientation.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\"/> Churches now seized for themselves the political and social issues to tackle, such as nuclear power and justice for the Third World.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Social Christianity movement temporarily discontinued and its journal, ''Other Times'', ceased to be published.<ref name=\"France Culture 2010\"/> However, the movement was relaunched on 10 June 2010 with a petition signed by over 240 people<ref name=\"France Culture 2010\"/> and now maintains an active presence with its own website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianismesocial.org |title=Accueil |website=...Se r\u00e9clamant du christianisme social |language=French |trans-title=Welcome |access-date=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, Calvinists have supported capitalism and have been in the vanguard of promoting market capitalism<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite magazine |date=16 April 1998 |title=Prim but Punchy |url=http://www.economist.com/node/160426 |url-access=limited |magazine=The Economist |volume=346 |issue=8064 |page=48 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> and have produced many of France's leading entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"The Economist\"/> With regard to politics and social issues however, they are very much socialists.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\"/> Three of France's post-war prime ministers have been Calvinists, despite Protestants only making up two percent of the population.

Its beginnings may be traced to [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] (1684\u20131761), of Llanddowror, [[Carmarthenshire]], whose sympathy for the poor led him to set on foot a system of circulating charity schools for the education of children.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, until the nineteenth century, the prevailing thought amongst Welsh non-conformists was that \"it would be wiser if the churches limited their activities to those of the altar and not to meddle at all with the state and social questions\". This stemmed partly from the traditional nonconformist belief in the separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=3}}\n\nIn his influential sermon, ''Y Ddwy Alwedigaeth'' (The Two Vocations), [[Emrys ap Iwan]] challenged this passive pietism: \"We must not think, like the old Methodists, Puritans and some Catholics, that we can only seek Godliness outside our earthly vocation.\" He condemned those Christians who limited godliness to directly religious matters such as Sabbath observance and personal devotion. He declared that all earthly things, including language and culture, have some kind of divine origin.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nMany of the founders of the Welsh nationalist social-democratic party, [[Plaid Cymru]] were also devout Calvinists,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} including [[John Edward Daniel]]. Daniel was the theologian credited for bringing neo-orthodoxy to Wales. Daniel argued that God did not create man as an isolated individual but as a social being.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe second generation of Plaid Cymru leaders included [[R. Tudur Jones]]. His political stance, combined with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine, created an integrated vision that was significant to the religious life of Christian Wales in the later half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Davies|Jenkins|Baines|Lynch|2008}} Jones argued that the \"state should be a servant, to preserve order and to allow men to live the good life\".{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=5}}\n\nToday, many Calvinist socialists in Wales support same-sex marriage on the grounds that it delivers marriage equality in the eyes of the state while still allowing churches to follow their own conscience, thus upholding the traditional Protestant belief in separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=7}}\n\nThe Calvinist tradition in Plaid Cymru has also influenced its non-violent approach.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} \"The ideal is no fist violence, no verbal violence, and no heart violence.... Christians... point to the New Testament example of Jesus Christ clearing the temple. Here there is no suggestion of violence against people; rather the tables are turned as a symbolic act.
