Kurt was described as being a happy and excitable child, who also exhibited sensitivity and care.

While living with the [[born-again Christian]] family of his friend Jesse Reed, he became a devout Christian and regularly attended church services. He later renounced Christianity, engaging in what was described as \"anti-God\" rants. The song \"[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]\" is about his experience while living with the Reed family.

He stated, \"I started being really proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasn't.\" His friend tried to kiss him and Cobain backed away, explaining to his friend that he was not gay, but remained friends with him. In a 1993 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Cobain claimed that he was \"gay in spirit\" and \"probably could be [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].\" He also stated that he used to spray paint \"God Is Gay\" on pickup trucks in the Aberdeen area.

Two weeks prior to graduation, he dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]], upon realizing that he did not have enough credits to graduate. His mother gave him a choice: find employment or leave. After one week, Cobain found his clothes and other belongings packed away in boxes.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|35}} Feeling banished from his own mother's home, Cobain stayed with friends, occasionally sneaking back into his mother's basement.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|37}} Cobain also claimed that, during periods of homelessness, he lived under a bridge over the [[Wishkah River]],<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|37}} an experience that inspired the song \"[[Something in the Way]]\".

The couple had a close relationship, but one that was often strained with financial difficulties and Cobain's absence when touring. Marander supported the couple by working at the cafeteria of the [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]], often stealing food. During his time with Marander, Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening, watching television, and concentrating on art projects. Her insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write \"[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]\", which was featured on the Nirvana album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''. Marander is credited with having taken the cover photo for the album. She did not become aware that Cobain wrote \"About a Girl\" about her until years after his death. <ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|88\u201393}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|116\u2013117}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|122}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|134\u2013136}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|143}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}}\n\nSoon after his separation from Marander, Cobain began dating [[Tobi Vail]], an influential [[punk zine]]ster of the [[riot grrrl]] band [[Bikini Kill]] who embraced the [[DIY]] ethos. After meeting Vail, Cobain vomited, as he was so completely overwhelmed with anxiety caused by his infatuation with her. This event inspired the lyric \"love you so much it makes me sick,\" which appears in the song \"[[Aneurysm (song)|Aneurysm]]\".<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|152}} While Cobain regarded Vail as his female counterpart, his relationship with her waned; he desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship, which Vail regarded as sexist within a [[countercultural]] punk rock community. Vail's lovers were described by her friend Alice Wheeler as \"fashion accessories.\"<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}} Cobain and Vail spent most of their time together as a couple discussing political and philosophical issues. In 1990, they collaborated on a musical project called Bathtub is Real, in which they both sang and played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track tape]] machine that belonged to Vail's father. In [[Everett True]]'s 2009 book ''Nirvana: The Biography'', Vail is quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|[Kurt] would play the songs he was writing, I would play the songs I was writing and we'd record them on my dad's four-track.

Once, while he was discussing [[anarchism]] and punk rock with friend [[Kathleen Hanna]], another member of Bikini Kill, Hanna spray-painted \"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on Cobain's apartment wall. [[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|Teen Spirit]] was the name of a deodorant Vail wore.

While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met [[Krist Novoselic]], a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs room of the salon.

The band name \"Nirvana\" was taken from the [[Nirvana|Buddhist concept]], which Cobain described as \"freedom from pain, suffering and the external world,\" a concept that he aligned with the [[punk rock]] ethos and [[Punk ideologies|ideology]].\n\nCobain was disenchanted after early touring, due to the band's inability to draw substantial crowds and the difficulty of sustaining themselves. During their first few years playing together, Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a rotating list of drummers. Eventually, the band settled on [[Chad Channing]], with whom Nirvana recorded the album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] in 1989. Cobain, however, became dissatisfied with Channing's style and subsequently fired him which made the band in need of a new drummer. They eventually hired [[Dave Grohl]] who helped the band record their 1991 major-label debut, ''Nevermind''. With ''Nevermind''{{'}}s lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] called \"[[grunge]]\". Since their debut, Nirvana has sold over 25&nbsp;million albums in the United States (U.S.) alone, and over 80&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|title=Top-Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html|title=Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> The success of ''Nevermind'' provided numerous Seattle bands, such as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]], access to wider audiences. As a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the U.S. during the early to middle 1990s. Nirvana was considered the \"flagship band of [[Generation X]],\" and Cobain found himself reluctantly anointed by the media as the generation's \"spokesman.\"<ref name=\"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana2\"/>\n\nCobain struggled to reconcile the massive success of Nirvana with his [[Underground rock|underground]] roots and vision. He also felt persecuted by the media, comparing himself to [[Frances Farmer]]. He began to harbor resentment against people who claimed to be fans of the band, yet refused to acknowledge, or misinterpreted, the band's social and political views. A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and homophobia, he was publicly proud that Nirvana had played at a [[gay rights]] benefit, supporting No-on-Nine, in Oregon in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portside.org/2014-01-07/king-outcast-teens-kurt-cobain-and-politics-nirvana|title=King of the Outcast Teens: Kurt Cobain and the Politics of Nirvana|last=Barrett|first=Dawson|date=January 6, 2014|publisher=Portside|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> The show was held in opposition to [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure Nine]], a ballot measure, that if passed, would have directed schools to teach that homosexuality was \"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hornet.com/stories/nirvana-gay-rights-1992-gop/|title=In 1992, Nirvana Fought an Anti-Gay Ballot Initiative (and Wanted to Burn Down GOP Headquarters)|publisher=Hornet|last=Villarreal|first=David|date=December 7, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref> Cobain was a vocal supporter of the [[pro-choice]] movement and Nirvana was involved in [[L7 (band)|L7]]'s [[Rock for Choice]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Gold|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-29/entertainment/ca-68_1_pop-music-review|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Bands Get Together for Rock for Choice|date=September 29, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> He received [[death threat]]s from a small number of [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]] activists for participating in the pro-choice campaign, with one activist threatening to shoot Cobain as soon as he stepped on a stage.<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|253}}\n\n=== Collaboration with other artists ===\nIn 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American [[alternative rock]] band [[Screaming Trees]] formed a side project known as the Jury.

Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands, including Led Zeppelin's \"[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]],\" \"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\" and \"[[Immigrant Song]],\" Black Sabbath's \"[[Hand of Doom (song)|Hand of Doom]],\" and Kiss' \"Do You Love Me?\" and wrote the ''[[Incesticide]]'' song \"Aero Zeppelin\" as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. Recollecting touring with his band, Cobain stated, \u201cI used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van. We\u2019d be stuck with a dead battery because I\u2019d listened to Queen too much\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |first=Amy|last=Weller|title=If it wasn't for Freddie Mercury... 13 artists inspired by the Queen icon |url=https://www.gigwise.com/photos/84002/9/if-it-wasnt-for-freddie-mercury-13-artists-inspired-by-the-queen-icon |date=September 5, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2018 |work=Gigwise}}</ref>\n\nPunk rock proved to be a profound influence on a teenaged Cobain's attitude and artistic style. His first punk rock album was ''[[Sandinista!]]'' by [[The Clash]],<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|169}} but he became a bigger fan of a fellow 1970s British punk band the [[Sex Pistols]], describing them as \"one million times more important than the Clash\" in his journals.<ref name=\"Cobain, Kurt 2002\"/> He was introduced to 1980s American hardcore bands like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Millions of Dead Cops]] and [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] by [[Buzz Osborne]], lead singer and guitarist of the [[Melvins]] and fellow Aberdeen native.

In a 1992 interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'', \"convinced him to abandon his more Black Flag-influenced songwriting in favor of the [[Iggy Pop]]/Aerosmith\u2013type songwriting that appeared on ''Nevermind''.<ref>Cobain, Kurt. \"Kurt Cobain of Nirvana Talks About the Records That Changed His Life. ''[[Melody Maker]]''. August 29, 1992.</ref> In a 1993 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he said that \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was his attempt at \"trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band\u2014or at least a Pixies cover band.

It was under recommendation from Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]] that Nirvana signed to [[DGC Records|DGC]] in 1990,<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|162}} and both bands did a two-week tour of Europe in the summer of 1991, as documented in the 1992 documentary, ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]''. In 1993, Cobain said of R.E.M.: \"If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what they've written... I don't know how that band does what they do. God, they're the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music\".<ref name=\"pixies\"/>\n\nAfter attaining mainstream success, Cobain became a devoted champion of lesser known [[indie rock|indie]] bands, covering songs by [[The Vaselines]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Wipers]] and [[Fang (band)|Fang]] onstage and/or in the studio, wearing [[Daniel Johnston]] [[T-shirts]] during photo shoots, having the [[K Records]] logo tattooed on his forearm, and enlisting bands like [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Shonen Knife]], [[Chokebore]] and [[Half Japanese]] along for the ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour in late 1993 and early 1994. Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him: ex-[[Germs (band)|Germs]] guitarist [[Pat Smear]] joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvana's 1993 ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' appearance to perform three songs from their second album, ''[[Meat Puppets II]]''.\n\nNirvana's ''Unplugged'' set also included renditions of \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold the World]],\" by British rock musician [[David Bowie]], and the American folk song, \"[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]],\" as adapted by the American folk musician [[Lead Belly]]. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer, and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author [[William S. Burroughs]]. \"I remember [Burroughs] saying in an interview, 'These new rock'n'roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul, like Leadbelly,'\" Cobain said. \"I'd never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records, and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music.

He wrote about fame, drug addiction and abortion on \"[[Pennyroyal Tea]]\", as well as women's rights and the life of Seattle-born Farmer on \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\".\n\nCobain was affected enough to write the song \"[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]\" from ''Nevermind'', after reading a newspaper story of an incident in 1987, where a 14-year-old girl was kidnapped after attending a punk rock show then raped and tortured with a [[Blow torch|blowtorch]].

He spent the day talking to counselors about his drug abuse and personal problems, happily playing with his daughter Frances. These interactions were the last time Cobain saw his daughter.\n\nThe following night, Cobain walked outside to have a cigarette and climbed over a six-foot-high fence to leave the facility (which he had joked earlier in the day would be a stupid feat to attempt). He took a taxi to Los Angeles Airport and flew back to Seattle. On the flight, he sat near to [[Duff McKagan]] of [[Guns N' Roses]]. Despite Cobain's own personal animosity towards Guns N' Roses, and specifically [[Axl Rose]], Cobain \"seemed happy\" to see McKagan. McKagan later stated he knew from \"all of my instincts that something was wrong\".<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|331}} Most of his close friends and family were unaware of his whereabouts. On April 2 and 3, Cobain was spotted in numerous locations around Seattle. On April 3, Love contacted private investigator Tom Grant, and hired him to find Cobain. Cobain was not seen the next day.

The book explored Cobain's drug addiction, as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobain's death, Azerrad republished the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobain's life. The book is notable, as it involved the band members themselves, who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrad's taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain, titled ''[[Kurt Cobain: About a Son]]''. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana, it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.\n\nJournalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] published their investigation of any possible conspiracy surrounding Cobain's death in their 1999 book''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?''. Halperin and Wallace argued that, while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened.<ref>Halperin & Wallace, p. 202</ref> A notable element of the book included the journalists' discussions with Tom Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.\n\nIn 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain, titled ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]''. For the book, Cross conducted over 400 interviews, and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobain's journals, lyrics, and diaries.<ref name=\"Heavierthan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperionbooks.com/book/heavier-than-heaven-a-biography-of-kurt-cobain/|title=Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain|publisher=HyperionBooks.com|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> Cross' biography was met with criticism, including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.<ref>''Nirvana: the True Story'' by [[Everett True]]</ref> Friend [[Everett True]], who derided the book as being inaccurate, omissive, and highly biased; he said ''Heavier than Heaven'' was \"the Courtney-sanctioned version of history\"<ref name=\"SmellsLike2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=184892|title=Smells Like Everett True \u2013 Books \u2013 The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper|publisher=Thestranger.com|date=March 27, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}</ref> or, alternatively, Cross's \"Oh, I think I need to find the new [[Bruce Springsteen]] now\" Kurt Cobain book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|title=MAGNET Interview: Everett True|work=magnetmagazine.com|author=Matthew Fritch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|archivedate=June 17, 2003|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> However, beyond the criticism, the book contained details about Cobain and Nirvana's career that would have otherwise been unnoted. In 2008, Cross published ''Cobain Unseen: Mosaic of an Artist'', a compilation of annotated photographs and creations and writings by Cobain throughout his life and career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/23454963/cobain_unseen_rare_photos_artw/photo/17|title=Cobain Unseen: Rare Photos, Artwork and Journal Entries|work=Rolling Stone|author=Charles M.

Cross}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a sampling of Cobain's writings was published as ''[[Journals (Cobain)|Journals]]''. The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover; the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically (although Cobain generally did not date them). The journal pages are reproduced in color, and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book, released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals, Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road, made lists of what music he was enjoying, and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release, reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words, but were disturbed by what was viewed as an [[Invasion of privacy|invasion of his privacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |title=Nirvana releases a hit and miss|work=Notre Dame Observer|date=November 19, 2002|author=David Hartwig|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 8, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307110632/http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[ECW Press]] released a book titled ''Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music''.

He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love; Love's father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors|Mentors]] bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke]], who claimed Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hoke's last interview, as he died days later, reportedly hit by a train. However, Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying:\n\n{{quote|I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him.

However, Nirvana bassist Novoselic later said, \"He hung out there, but you couldn't live on those muddy banks, with the tides coming up and down. That was his own revisionism\".<ref name=\"requiem\">Cross, Charles R. \"Requiem for a Dream.\" ''Guitar World.''

The couple had a close relationship, but one that was often strained with financial difficulties and Cobain's absence when touring. Marander supported the couple by working at the cafeteria of the [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]], often stealing food. During his time with Marander, Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening, watching television, and concentrating on art projects. Her insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write \"[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]\", which was featured on the Nirvana album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''. Marander is credited with having taken the cover photo for the album. She did not become aware that Cobain wrote \"About a Girl\" about her until years after his death. <ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|88\u201393}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|116\u2013117}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|122}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|134\u2013136}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|143}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}}\n\nSoon after his separation from Marander, Cobain began dating [[Tobi Vail]], an influential [[punk zine]]ster of the [[riot grrrl]] band [[Bikini Kill]] who embraced the [[DIY]] ethos. After meeting Vail, Cobain vomited, as he was so completely overwhelmed with anxiety caused by his infatuation with her. This event inspired the lyric \"love you so much it makes me sick,\" which appears in the song \"[[Aneurysm (song)|Aneurysm]]\".<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|152}} While Cobain regarded Vail as his female counterpart, his relationship with her waned; he desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship, which Vail regarded as sexist within a [[countercultural]] punk rock community. Vail's lovers were described by her friend Alice Wheeler as \"fashion accessories.\"<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}} Cobain and Vail spent most of their time together as a couple discussing political and philosophical issues. In 1990, they collaborated on a musical project called Bathtub is Real, in which they both sang and played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track tape]] machine that belonged to Vail's father. In [[Everett True]]'s 2009 book ''Nirvana: The Biography'', Vail is quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|[Kurt] would play the songs he was writing, I would play the songs I was writing and we'd record them on my dad's four-track. Sometimes I'd sing on the songs he was writing and play drums on them ... He was really into the fact that I was creative and into music. I don't think he'd ever played music with a girl before.

Once, while he was discussing [[anarchism]] and punk rock with friend [[Kathleen Hanna]], another member of Bikini Kill, Hanna spray-painted \"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on Cobain's apartment wall. [[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|Teen Spirit]] was the name of a deodorant Vail wore. Cobain, unaware of the deodorant's existence, interpreted the slogan as having a revolutionary meaning, and it inspired the title of the Nirvana song \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]].\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Queenan|title=Was Smells Like Teen Spirit really named after a deodorant|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/19/popandrock.nirvana|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early musical projects ===\nOn his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar\u2014Kurt chose the guitar. Soon, he was trying to play [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[power ballad]], \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\". He also learned how to play \"[[Louie Louie]],\" [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", and [[the Cars]]' \"[[My Best Friend's Girl (song)|My Best Friend's Girl]]\", before he began working on his own songs. Cobain played left-handed, despite being forced to write right-handed.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|22}}\n\nIn early 1985, Cobain formed [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]] after he had dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]].<ref name=\"gaar\">Gillian G.

While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met [[Krist Novoselic]], a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Cobain's earlier band, Fecal Matter.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />\n\n=== Nirvana ===\n[[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Cobain and Novoselic playing at the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards]]]]\n{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}\n<!-- Please don't significantly expand this section, it is intended to simply cover the basics of Cobain's involvement in Nirvana. The details about Nirvana's career are extensively discussed in [[Nirvana (band)]]. -->\n\nAfter months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|45}} Religion appeared to remain a significant muse to Cobain during this time, as he often used Christian related imagery in his work, and developed a budding interest in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy. The band name \"Nirvana\" was taken from the [[Nirvana|Buddhist concept]], which Cobain described as \"freedom from pain, suffering and the external world,\" a concept that he aligned with the [[punk rock]] ethos and [[Punk ideologies|ideology]].\n\nCobain was disenchanted after early touring, due to the band's inability to draw substantial crowds and the difficulty of sustaining themselves. During their first few years playing together, Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a rotating list of drummers. Eventually, the band settled on [[Chad Channing]], with whom Nirvana recorded the album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] in 1989. Cobain, however, became dissatisfied with Channing's style and subsequently fired him which made the band in need of a new drummer. They eventually hired [[Dave Grohl]] who helped the band record their 1991 major-label debut, ''Nevermind''. With ''Nevermind''{{'}}s lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] called \"[[grunge]]\". Since their debut, Nirvana has sold over 25&nbsp;million albums in the United States (U.S.) alone, and over 80&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|title=Top-Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html|title=Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> The success of ''Nevermind'' provided numerous Seattle bands, such as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]], access to wider audiences. As a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the U.S. during the early to middle 1990s. Nirvana was considered the \"flagship band of [[Generation X]],\" and Cobain found himself reluctantly anointed by the media as the generation's \"spokesman.\"<ref name=\"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana2\"/>\n\nCobain struggled to reconcile the massive success of Nirvana with his [[Underground rock|underground]] roots and vision. He also felt persecuted by the media, comparing himself to [[Frances Farmer]]. He began to harbor resentment against people who claimed to be fans of the band, yet refused to acknowledge, or misinterpreted, the band's social and political views. A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and homophobia, he was publicly proud that Nirvana had played at a [[gay rights]] benefit, supporting No-on-Nine, in Oregon in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portside.org/2014-01-07/king-outcast-teens-kurt-cobain-and-politics-nirvana|title=King of the Outcast Teens: Kurt Cobain and the Politics of Nirvana|last=Barrett|first=Dawson|date=January 6, 2014|publisher=Portside|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> The show was held in opposition to [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure Nine]], a ballot measure, that if passed, would have directed schools to teach that homosexuality was \"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hornet.com/stories/nirvana-gay-rights-1992-gop/|title=In 1992, Nirvana Fought an Anti-Gay Ballot Initiative (and Wanted to Burn Down GOP Headquarters)|publisher=Hornet|last=Villarreal|first=David|date=December 7, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref> Cobain was a vocal supporter of the [[pro-choice]] movement and Nirvana was involved in [[L7 (band)|L7]]'s [[Rock for Choice]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Gold|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-29/entertainment/ca-68_1_pop-music-review|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Bands Get Together for Rock for Choice|date=September 29, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> He received [[death threat]]s from a small number of [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]] activists for participating in the pro-choice campaign, with one activist threatening to shoot Cobain as soon as he stepped on a stage.<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|253}}\n\n=== Collaboration with other artists ===\nIn 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American [[alternative rock]] band [[Screaming Trees]] formed a side project known as the Jury.

Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands, including Led Zeppelin's \"[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]],\" \"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\" and \"[[Immigrant Song]],\" Black Sabbath's \"[[Hand of Doom (song)|Hand of Doom]],\" and Kiss' \"Do You Love Me?\" and wrote the ''[[Incesticide]]'' song \"Aero Zeppelin\" as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. Recollecting touring with his band, Cobain stated, \u201cI used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van.

His first punk rock album was ''[[Sandinista!]]'' by [[The Clash]],<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|169}} but he became a bigger fan of a fellow 1970s British punk band the [[Sex Pistols]], describing them as \"one million times more important than the Clash\" in his journals.<ref name=\"Cobain, Kurt 2002\"/> He was introduced to 1980s American hardcore bands like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Millions of Dead Cops]] and [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] by [[Buzz Osborne]], lead singer and guitarist of the [[Melvins]] and fellow Aberdeen native.

In a 1992 interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'', \"convinced him to abandon his more Black Flag-influenced songwriting in favor of the [[Iggy Pop]]/Aerosmith\u2013type songwriting that appeared on ''Nevermind''.<ref>Cobain, Kurt. \"Kurt Cobain of Nirvana Talks About the Records That Changed His Life.

It was under recommendation from Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]] that Nirvana signed to [[DGC Records|DGC]] in 1990,<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|162}} and both bands did a two-week tour of Europe in the summer of 1991, as documented in the 1992 documentary, ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]''. In 1993, Cobain said of R.E.M.: \"If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what they've written... I don't know how that band does what they do. God, they're the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music\".<ref name=\"pixies\"/>\n\nAfter attaining mainstream success, Cobain became a devoted champion of lesser known [[indie rock|indie]] bands, covering songs by [[The Vaselines]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Wipers]] and [[Fang (band)|Fang]] onstage and/or in the studio, wearing [[Daniel Johnston]] [[T-shirts]] during photo shoots, having the [[K Records]] logo tattooed on his forearm, and enlisting bands like [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Shonen Knife]], [[Chokebore]] and [[Half Japanese]] along for the ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour in late 1993 and early 1994. Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him: ex-[[Germs (band)|Germs]] guitarist [[Pat Smear]] joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvana's 1993 ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' appearance to perform three songs from their second album, ''[[Meat Puppets II]]''.\n\nNirvana's ''Unplugged'' set also included renditions of \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold the World]],\" by British rock musician [[David Bowie]], and the American folk song, \"[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]],\" as adapted by the American folk musician [[Lead Belly]]. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer, and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author [[William S. Burroughs]]. \"I remember [Burroughs] saying in an interview, 'These new rock'n'roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul, like Leadbelly,'\" Cobain said. \"I'd never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records, and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music.

The book explored Cobain's drug addiction, as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobain's death, Azerrad republished the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobain's life. The book is notable, as it involved the band members themselves, who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrad's taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain, titled ''[[Kurt Cobain: About a Son]]''. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana, it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.\n\nJournalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] published their investigation of any possible conspiracy surrounding Cobain's death in their 1999 book''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?''. Halperin and Wallace argued that, while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened.<ref>Halperin & Wallace, p. 202</ref> A notable element of the book included the journalists' discussions with Tom Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.\n\nIn 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain, titled ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]''. For the book, Cross conducted over 400 interviews, and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobain's journals, lyrics, and diaries.<ref name=\"Heavierthan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperionbooks.com/book/heavier-than-heaven-a-biography-of-kurt-cobain/|title=Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain|publisher=HyperionBooks.com|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> Cross' biography was met with criticism, including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.<ref>''Nirvana: the True Story'' by [[Everett True]]</ref> Friend [[Everett True]], who derided the book as being inaccurate, omissive, and highly biased; he said ''Heavier than Heaven'' was \"the Courtney-sanctioned version of history\"<ref name=\"SmellsLike2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=184892|title=Smells Like Everett True \u2013 Books \u2013 The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper|publisher=Thestranger.com|date=March 27, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}</ref> or, alternatively, Cross's \"Oh, I think I need to find the new [[Bruce Springsteen]] now\" Kurt Cobain book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|title=MAGNET Interview: Everett True|work=magnetmagazine.com|author=Matthew Fritch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|archivedate=June 17, 2003|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> However, beyond the criticism, the book contained details about Cobain and Nirvana's career that would have otherwise been unnoted.

The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover; the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically (although Cobain generally did not date them). The journal pages are reproduced in color, and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book, released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals, Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road, made lists of what music he was enjoying, and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release, reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words, but were disturbed by what was viewed as an [[Invasion of privacy|invasion of his privacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |title=Nirvana releases a hit and miss|work=Notre Dame Observer|date=November 19, 2002|author=David Hartwig|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 8, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307110632/http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[ECW Press]] released a book titled ''Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music''.

He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love; Love's father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors|Mentors]] bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke]], who claimed Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hoke's last interview, as he died days later, reportedly hit by a train. However, Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying:\n\n{{quote|I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun.

The content was variable: most focused on recording the ownership of estates and the descent of lordships of [[manor]]s, thus the genealogies of county families, heraldry and other antiquarian material; In the introduction to one typical early work of this style, ''The Antiquities of Warwickshire'' published in 1656, the author [[William Dugdale]] writes:<ref>https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/n7/mode/2up</ref>\n{{quote|I offer unto you my noble countriemen, as the most proper persons to whom it can be presented wherein you will see very much of your worthy ancestors, to whose memory I have erected it as a monumentall pillar and to shew in what honour they lived in those flourishing ages past. In this kind, or not much different, have divers persons in forrein parts very learnedly written; some whereof I have noted in my preface: and I could wish that there were more that would adventure in the like manner for the rest of the counties of this nation, considering how acceptable those are, which others have already performed}}\nThus his work was designed primarily to be read by his fellow county gentry of Warwickshire, whose public lives and marriages were largely confined within their own county of residence, which they administered as Justices of the Peace and Sheriffs, and represented in Parliament. The genealogical and heraldic tradition continues with the series of [[Victoria County History|Victoria County Histories]] commenced in the late 19th century. \n\nOther forms recorded [[archaeological site]]s. A closely related genre, which emerged in the second half of the 17th century, was the county \"Natural History\", which focused on the county's flora, fauna and natural phenomena, but which also often included chapters on antiquities. The best known examples were [[Robert Plot]]'s two volumes on Oxfordshire (1677) and Staffordshire (1686); and [[John Aubrey]]'s unpublished work on Wiltshire.\n\n==Development==\n===Continental models===\nDugdale quotes as his foreign models C\u00e9sar de Nostredame (1553-1629), historian of [[Provence]] in France, author of ''Rerum antiquarum et nobiliorum Provinciae'', written c.1560, published 1615; Ottavio Rossi, historian of [[Brescia]] in Italy, author of ''Memorie Bresciane, Opera Historica, E Simbolica'' (1626);  Guillaume Catel (1560-1626), historian of [[Languedoc]] in France, author of ''M\u00e9moires sur l'histoire du Languedoc'' (1633); [[Samuel Guichenon]] (1607-1664), historian of Bresse in France, author of  ''Histoire de la [[Bresse]] et du [[Bugey]]'' (1650) and [[Antonius Sanderus]] (1586-1664), historian of Flanders, author of ''Flandria Illustrata'' (1641).\n\n===English pioneers===\n[[William Lambarde]]'s ''Perambulation of [[Kent]]'' (completed 1570; published 1576) is generally acknowledged as the first example of the genre in England. It was followed by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew's]] ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602), and [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton's]] ''Description of Leicester Shire'' (1622), as well as a number of other projects (such as those of [[Sir William Pole]], [[Thomas Westcote]], and [[Tristram Risdon]] in Devon, and [[Sampson Erdeswicke]] in Staffordshire) which, although they sometimes circulated in manuscript, did not come to completion or publication. Following the appearance of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century [[John Bowyer Nichols]] followed the line of a history of [[Leicestershire]] compiled by his father [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nichols, John Bowyer}}</ref> The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: \"Antiquities of\", \"Worthies of\", \"Geological survey\", \"Description of\", later \"Directory of\", all could indicate the intention of producing a \"history\", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today. [[Chorography]], [[topography]] and [[toponymy]] might all be involved. Materials and collections for their counties were made by antiquaries, but publication might await sponsorship or enough subscriptions, as well as a capable author who would make a readable book, perhaps of multiple volumes, from notes.\n\n==Listing by county==\n\n===Bedfordshire===\nSee: [[History of Bedfordshire]]; [[:Category: History of Bedfordshire]];\n\n*''[[Magna Britannia]]'' (1806)\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/catalogue.aspx?gid=1&type=1 ''Victoria County History''] three volumes, 1904\u20131912\n\n===Berkshire===\n*[[Elias Ashmole]], ''Antiquities of Berkshire'' (1719)\n* J.

The content was variable: most focused on recording the ownership of estates and the descent of lordships of [[manor]]s, thus the genealogies of county families, heraldry and other antiquarian material; In the introduction to one typical early work of this style, ''The Antiquities of Warwickshire'' published in 1656, the author [[William Dugdale]] writes:<ref>https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/n7/mode/2up</ref><br/>\n:''I offer unto you my noble countriemen, as the most proper persons to whom it can be presented wherein you will see very much of your worthy ancestors, to whose memory I have erected it as a monumentall pillar and to shew in what honour they lived in those flourishing ages past. In this kind, or not much different, have divers persons in forrein parts very learnedly written; some whereof I have noted in my preface: and I could wish that there were more that would adventure in the like manner for the rest of the counties of this nation, considering how acceptable those are, which others have already performed''.<br/>\nThus his work was designed primarily to be read by his fellow county gentry of Warwickshire, whose public lives and marriages were largely confined within their own county of residence, which they administered as Justices of the Peace and Sheriffs, and represented in Parliament. The genealogical and heraldic tradition continues with the series of [[Victoria County History|Victoria County Histories]] commenced in the late 19th century. \n\nOther forms recorded [[archaeological site]]s. A closely related genre, which emerged in the second half of the 17th century, was the county \"Natural History\", which focused on the county's flora, fauna and natural phenomena, but which also often included chapters on antiquities. The best known examples were [[Robert Plot]]'s two volumes on Oxfordshire (1677) and Staffordshire (1686); and [[John Aubrey]]'s unpublished work on Wiltshire.\n\n==Development==\n===Continental models===\nDugdale quotes as his foreign models C\u00e9sar de Nostredame (1553-1629), historian of [[Provence]] in France, author of ''Rerum antiquarum et nobiliorum Provinciae'', written c.1560, published 1615; Ottavio Rossi, historian of [[Brescia]] in Italy, author of ''Memorie Bresciane, Opera Historica, E Simbolica'' (1626);  Guillaume Catel (1560-1626), historian of [[Languedoc]] in France, author of ''M\u00e9moires sur l'histoire du Languedoc'' (1633); [[Samuel Guichenon]] (1607-1664), historian of Bresse in France, author of  ''Histoire de la [[Bresse]] et du [[Bugey]]'' (1650) and [[Antonius Sanderus]] (1586-1664), historian of Flanders, author of ''Flandria Illustrata'' (1641).\n\n===English pioneers===\n[[William Lambarde]]'s ''Perambulation of [[Kent]]'' (completed 1570; published 1576) is generally acknowledged as the first example of the genre in England. It was followed by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew's]] ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602), and [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton's]] ''Description of Leicester Shire'' (1622), as well as a number of other projects (such as those of [[Sir William Pole]], [[Thomas Westcote]], and [[Tristram Risdon]] in Devon, and [[Sampson Erdeswicke]] in Staffordshire) which, although they sometimes circulated in manuscript, did not come to completion or publication. Following the appearance of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century [[John Bowyer Nichols]] followed the line of a history of [[Leicestershire]] compiled by his father [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nichols, John Bowyer}}</ref> The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: \"Antiquities of\", \"Worthies of\", \"Geological survey\", \"Description of\", later \"Directory of\", all could indicate the intention of producing a \"history\", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today. [[Chorography]], [[topography]] and [[toponymy]] might all be involved.

Maimon, of blessed memory, had been taken up (i.e. euphemism for \"had died\"), in the year [4],965 [[anno mundi]] (= 1204/5 CE) in Egypt, and the Jews wept for him \u2013 as did [all] the Egyptians \u2013 three days, and they coined a name for that time of year, [saying], 'there was wailing,' and on the seventh day [of his passing], the news reached Alexandria, and on the eighth day, [the news reached] Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem they made a great public mourning [on his behalf] and called for a fast and public gathering, where it was that the prayer precentor read out the admonitions, 'If you shall walk in my statutes [etc.]' (Leviticus 26:3-ff.), as well as read the concluding verse [from the Prophets], 'And it came to pass that Samuel spoke to all of Israel [etc.],' and he then concluded by saying that the Ark of God had been taken away. Now after certain days they brought up his coffin to the Land of Israel, during which journey thieves encountered them, causing those who had gone up to flee, leaving there the coffin. Now the thieves, when they saw that they had all fled, they desired to have the coffin cast into the sea, but were unable with all their strength to uproot the coffin from the ground, even though they had been more than thirty men, and when they considered the matter, they then said to themselves that he was a godly and holy man, and so they went their way. However, they gave assurances to the Jews that they would escort them to their destination, and so it was that they also accompanied him and '''he was buried in Tiberias'''.\"</ref>\n\nDuring his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides' writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, even as far away as Iraq and Yemen. Yet, while Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish community in Egypt]], his writings also had vociferous critics, particularly in Spain. Nonetheless, he was posthumously acknowledged as among the foremost rabbinical [[Posek|decisors]] and philosophers in [[Jewish history]], and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of [[Talmud]]ic law. He is sometimes known as \"ha Nesher ha Gadol\" (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a ''bona fide'' exponent of the [[Oral Torah]].\n\nAside from being revered by Jewish historians, Maimonides also figures very prominently in the history of Islamic and Arab sciences and is mentioned extensively in studies. Influenced by [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and his contemporary [[Averroes]], he in his turn influenced other prominent Arab and Muslim philosophers and scientists. He became a prominent philosopher and [[polymath]] in both the Jewish and Islamic worlds.\n\n==Name==\nHis full Hebrew name is Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon ({{Hebrew|\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05df \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05df}}), whose [[Hebrew acronym|acronym]] forms \"Rambam\" ({{Hebrew|\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\u05f4\u05dd}}).

Because of the dispute about the date of Maimonides's birth, it is not clear which year the work was published.</ref>\n\nFollowing this sojourn in Morocco, together with two sons,<ref>Davidson, p. 29.</ref> he sojourned in the [[Holy Land (Biblical)|Holy Land]], before settling in [[Fostat|Fustat]], Egypt around 1168.

He sent five letters to the Jewish communities of Lower Egypt asking them to pool money together to pay the [[ransom]]. The money was collected and then given to two judges sent to Palestine to negotiate with the Crusaders. The captives were eventually released.<ref>Cohen, Mark R.

Maimonides directed his brother to procure goods only at the [[Sudan|Sudanese]] port of [[\u2018Aydhab]]. After a long arduous trip through the desert, however, David was unimpressed by the goods on offer there. Against his brother's wishes, David boarded a ship for India, since great wealth was to be found in the East.<ref>The \"India Trade\" (a term devised by the Arabist S.D. Goitein) was a highly lucrative business venture in which Jewish merchants from Egypt, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East imported and exported goods ranging from pepper to brass from various ports along the [[Malabar Coast]] between the 11th\u201313th centuries.

The death of his brother caused Maimonides to become sick with grief.\n\nIn a letter (discovered later in the [[Cairo Geniza]]), he wrote:\n\n{{quote|The greatest misfortune that has befallen me during my entire life\u2014worse than anything else\u2014was the demise of the saint, may his memory be blessed, who drowned in the Indian sea, carrying much money belonging to me, to him, and to others, and left with me a little daughter and a widow.

They summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism:\n# The [[existence of God]].\n# God's [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|unity]] and indivisibility into elements.\n# God's [[spirituality]] and [[incorporeal]]ity.\n# God's [[eternity]].\n# [[God in Judaism#To God alone may one offer prayer|God alone]] should be the object of [[worship]].\n# [[Revelation]] through God's [[prophet]]s.\n# The preeminence of [[Moses]] among the prophets.\n# That the entire Torah (both the Written and Oral law) are of Divine origin and were dictated to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai.\n# The [[Torah]] given by Moses is permanent and will not be replaced or changed.\n# God's awareness of all human actions and thoughts.\n# Reward of righteousness and punishment of evil.\n# The coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]].\n# The [[resurrection of the dead]].\n\nMaimonides compiled the principles from various Talmudic sources. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbis [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]], and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries.<ref>''Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought'', Menachem Kellner</ref> However, these principles have become widely held and are considered to be the cardinal principals of faith for [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm|title=The Thirteen Principles of Jewish Faith|website=www.chabad.org}}</ref><ref>See, for example: [[Marc B. Shapiro]]. ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised''. Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (2011). pp. 1\u201314.</ref> Two poetic restatements of these principles (''[[Ani Ma'amin]]'' and ''[[Yigdal]]'') eventually became canonized in many editions of the \"[[Siddur]]\" (Jewish prayer book). Maimonides famously omitted any mention of these \"Principles of Faith\" from his later works, the [[Mishneh Torah]], and the [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Guide for the Perplexed]], leading some to suggest that either he retracted his earlier position, or that these principles are descriptive rather than prescriptive.\n\n==Legal works==\n{{main article|Mishneh Torah}}\nWith ''Mishneh Torah'', Maimonides composed a code of [[Jewish law]] with the widest-possible scope and depth. The work gathers all the binding laws from the [[Talmud]], and incorporates the positions of the [[Geonim]] (post-Talmudic early Medieval scholars, mainly from [[Mesopotamia]]).\n\nLater codes of Jewish law, e.g. [[Arba'ah Turim]] by Rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] and [[Shulchan Aruch]] by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], draw heavily on ''Mishneh Torah'': both often quote whole sections verbatim. However, it met initially with much opposition.<ref>Siegelbaum, Chana Bracha (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4HVwBMI5zK0C&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq=Mishneh+Torah+met+initially+opposition&source=bl&ots=p7VTtHovyS&sig=_ntA1Qo23D9AQ5MvoggZ9194Tg4&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAmoVChMIldLSte66xwIVghyQCh22dA_s#v=onepage&q=Mishneh%20Torah%20met%20initially%20opposition&f=false ''Women at the crossroads : a woman's perspective on the weekly Torah portion''] Gush Etzion: Midreshet B'erot Bat Ayin. {{ISBN|9781936068098}} page 199</ref> There were two main reasons for this opposition. First, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; second, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to \"cut out\" study of the Talmud,<ref>Last section of Maimonides's Introduction to Mishneh Torah</ref> to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law, although Maimonides later wrote that this was not his intent. His most forceful opponents were the rabbis of [[Provence]] (Southern France), and a running critique by Rabbi [[Abraham ben David]] (Raavad III) is printed in virtually all editions of ''Mishneh Torah''.  It was still recognized as a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of [[halakha]]. Throughout the centuries, it has been widely studied and its halakhic decisions have weighed heavily in later rulings.\n\nIn response to those who would attempt to force followers of Maimonides and his ''Mishneh Torah'' to abide by the rulings of his own [[Shulchan Aruch]] or other later works, Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] wrote: \"Who would dare force communities who follow the Rambam to follow any other decisor, early or late? \u2026 The Rambam is the greatest of the decisors, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabistan]] and the [[Maghreb]] practice according to his word, and accepted him as their rabbi.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=636&pgnum=70 |title=Avkat Rochel ch. 32 }}</ref>\n\nAn oft-cited legal maxim from his pen is: \"[[Blackstone's formulation|It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death]].\"  He argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely according to the judge's caprice.<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269\u201371 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).</ref>\n\nScholars specializing in the study of the history and subculture of Judaism in premodern China (Sino-Judaica) have noted surprising similarities between this work and the liturgy of the [[Kaifeng Jews]], descendants of Persian merchants who settled in the Middle Kingdom during the early [[Song dynasty]].<ref>Leslie, Donald. ''The Survival of the Chinese Jews; The Jewish Community of Kaifeng''. T\u02bboung pao, 10. Leiden: Brill, 1972, p. 157</ref> Beyond scriptural similarities, Michael Pollak comments the Jews' [[Pentateuch]] was divided into 53 sections according to the Persian style.<ref>Pollak, Michael. ''Mandarins, Jews, and Missionaries: The Jewish Experience in the Chinese Empire''. The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1980, p. 413</ref> He also points out:\n\n{{quote|There is no proof, to be sure, that Kaifeng Jewry ever had direct access to the works of \"the Great Eagle,\" but it would have had ample time and opportunity to acquire or become acquainted with them well before its reservoir of Jewish learning began to run out. Nor do the Maimonidean leanings of the ''{{linktext|kehillah}}'' contradict the historical evidence that has the Jews arriving in [[Kaifeng]] no later than 1126, the year in which [[Jingkang Incident|the Sung fled the city]]\u2014and nine years before Maimonides was born. In 1163, when the ''kehillah'' built the first of its synagogues, Maimonides was only twenty-eight years old, so that it is highly unlikely that even his earliest authoritative teachings could by then have reached China.<ref>Pollak, ''Mandarins, Jews, and Missionaries'', pp. 297\u2013298</ref>}}\n\n===Tzedakah (charity)===\nOne of the most widely referred to sections of the ''Mishneh Torah'' is the section dealing with [[tzedakah]]. In Hilkhot Matanot Aniyim (Laws about Giving to Poor People), Chapter 10:7\u201314, Maimonides lists his famous Eight Levels of Giving (where the first level is most preferable, and the eighth the least):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dannysiegel.com/maimonides_8_degrees.pdf |title=Hebrew Source of Maimonides's Levels of Giving with Danny Siegel's translation |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>\n\n# Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need; so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.\n# Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person (or public fund) which is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion.\n# Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient.\n# Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient.\n# Giving tzedakah before being asked.\n# Giving adequately after being asked.\n# Giving willingly, but inadequately.\n# Giving \"in sadness\" (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say \"Giving unwillingly.\"\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[File:Measure of men.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Maimonides teaching students about the 'measure of man' in an [[illuminated manuscript]].]]\nThrough the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (which was initially written in Arabic as ''Dal\u0101lat al-\u1e25\u0101\u02beir\u012bn'') and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers, especially on [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. He was a Jewish Scholastic. Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of Aristotle. Maimonides strove to reconcile [[wikt:Aristotelian|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy]] and science with the teachings of the [[Bible|Torah]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=The Guide to the Perplexed|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3963/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> In his ''Guide for the Perplexed'', he often explains the function and purpose of the statutory provisions contained in the Torah against the backdrop of the historical conditions. Maimonides is said to have been influenced by [[Asaph ha-Jehoudi]], who was the first [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] medical writer.\n\n===Theology===\nMaimonides equated the [[God in Judaism|God of Abraham]] to what philosophers refer to as the [[necessary being|Necessary Being]].  God is unique in the universe, and the Torah commands that one love and fear God (Deut 10:12) on account of that uniqueness.  To Maimonides, this meant that one ought to contemplate God's works and to marvel at the order and wisdom that went into their creation.  When one does this, one inevitably comes to love God and to sense how insignificant one is in comparison to God.  This is the basis of the Torah.<ref>Kraemer, 326-8</ref>\n\nThe principle that inspired his philosophical activity was identical to a fundamental tenet of [[scholasticism]]: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy. Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of Aristotle and the teachings of the Talmud, commonly finding basis in the former for the latter.<ref>Kraemer, 66</ref>\n\nMaimonides' admiration for the [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] commentators led him to doctrines which the later Scholastics did not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of \"[[negative theology]]\" (also known as \"Apophatic theology\".) In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes. For instance, one should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; it can be said that God is not non-existent. We should not say that \"God is wise\"; but we can say that \"God is not ignorant,\" i.e., in some way, God has some properties of knowledge. We should not say that \"God is One,\" but we can state that \"there is no multiplicity in God's being.\" In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of God by describing what God is not, rather than by describing what God \"is.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\">Robinson, George.  [https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/maimonides-conception-of-god/ \"Maimonides\u2019 Conception of God/\"] ''My Jewish Learning''.  30 April 2018.</ref>\n\nMaimonides argued adamantly that God is not corporeal.  This was central to his thinking about the sin of [[idolatry]].  Maimonides insisted that all of the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] phrases pertaining to God in sacred texts are to be interpreted [[metaphorically]].<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\n===Character development===\n{{see also|Golden mean (Judaism)}}\nMaimonides taught about the developing one's [[moral character]].  Although his life predated the modern concept of a [[personality]], Maimonides believed that each person has an innate disposition along an ethical and emotional spectrum.  Although one's disposition is often determined by factors outside of one's control, human beings have [[free will]] to choose to behave in ways that build character.<ref>Telushkin, 29</ref> He wrote, \"One is obligated to conduct his affairs with others in a gentle and pleasing manner.\"<ref>Commentary on ''The Ethics of the Fathers'' 1:15.  Qtd. in Telushkin, 115</ref> Maimonides advised those with anti-social character traits ought to identify those traits and then make a conscious effort to behave in the opposite way.  For example, an arrogant person should practice humility.<ref>Kraemer, 332-4</ref> If the circumstances of one's environment are such that it is impossible to behave ethically, one must move to a new location.<ref>MT ''De'ot'' 6:1</ref>\n\n===Prophecy===\nHe agrees with \"the Philosopher\" (Aristotle) in teaching that the use of logic is the \"right\" way of thinking. In order to build an inner understanding of how to know God, every human being must, by study, meditation and uncompromising strong will, attain the degree of complete logical, spiritual and physical perfection required in the [[prophet]]ic state. Here he rejects previous ideas (especially portrayed by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi in \"Hakuzari\") that in order to become a prophet, God must intervene. Maimonides claims that any man or woman<ref>\"Maimonides believed that women were capable of being instructed in Talmud and even that women can be prophetesses.\" Kraemer, 336</ref> has the potential to become a prophet (not just Jews) and that in fact it is the purpose of the human race.\n\n===The problem of evil===\nMaimonides wrote on [[theodicy]] (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a God with the existence of evil). He took the premise that an omnipotent and good God exists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Moses Maimonides|title=The Guide to the Perplexed|year=2007|publisher=BN Publishers}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Joseph Jacobs|title=Moses Ben Maimon|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&letter=M&search=maimonides#ixzz1GVE5kJqV |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Shlomo Pines|title=Maimonides (1135\u20131204)|journal=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006|volume=5|pages=647\u2013654}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Isadore Twersky|title=Maimonides, Moses|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2005|volume=8|pages=5613\u20135618}}</ref> In his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', Maimonides writes that all the evil that exists within human beings stems from their individual attributes, while all good comes from a universally shared humanity (Guide 3:8). He says that there are people who are guided by higher purpose, and there are those who are guided by physicality and must strive to find the higher purpose with which to guide their actions.\n\nTo justify the existence of evil, assuming God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, Maimonides postulates that one who created something by causing its opposite not to exist is not the same as creating something that exists; so evil is merely the absence of good. God did not create evil, rather God created good, and evil exists where good is absent (Guide 3:10). Therefore, all good is divine invention, and evil both is not and comes secondarily.\n\nMaimonides contests the common view that evil outweighs good in the world. He says that if one were to examine existence only in terms of humanity, then that person may observe evil to dominate good, but if one looks at the whole of the universe, then he sees good is significantly more common than evil (Guide 3:12). Man, he reasons, is too insignificant a figure in God's myriad works to be their primary characterizing force, and so when people see mostly evil in their lives, they are not taking into account the extent of positive Creation outside of themselves.\n\nMaimonides believes that there are three types of evil in the world: evil caused by nature, evil that people bring upon others, and evil man brings upon himself (Guide 3:12). The first type of evil Maimonides states is the rarest form, but arguably of the most necessary\u2014the balance of life and death in both the human and animal worlds itself, he recognizes, is essential to God's plan. Maimonides writes that the second type of evil is relatively rare, and that humanity brings it upon itself. The third type of evil humans bring upon themselves and is the source of most of the ills of the world. These are the result of people falling victim to their physical desires. To prevent the majority of evil which stems from harm we do to ourselves, we must learn how to ignore our bodily urges.\n\n===Skepticism of astrology===\n{{further information|Jewish views on astrology}}\nMaimonides answered an inquiry concerning astrology, addressed to him from [[Marseille]].<ref>Joel E. Kramer, \"Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait,\" p. 45. In {{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides |editor=Kenneth Seeskin |date=September 2005 |isbn=9780521525787}}</ref> He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he had studied astrology, and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. He ridicules the concept that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose, and would make man a slave of destiny.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rudavsky|first1=T.|title=Maimonidies|date=March 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-4898-6|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===True beliefs versus necessary beliefs===\nIn ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Book III, Chapter 28,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp164.htm |title=Guide for the Perplexed, on |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Maimonides draws a distinction between \"true beliefs,\" which were beliefs about God that produced intellectual perfection, and \"necessary beliefs,\" which were conducive to improving social order. Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about God in the latter class.  He uses as an example the notion that God becomes \"angry\" with people who do wrong.  In the view of Maimonides (taken from [[Avicenna]]), God does not become angry with people, as God has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe God does, so that they desist from doing wrong.\n\n===Eschatology===\n{{see also|Jewish eschatology}}\n====The World to Come====\nMaimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal [[active intellect]]; this is his interpretation of the ''no\u00fbs poietik\u00f3s'' of Aristotelian philosophy. It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of God.\n\nThe knowledge of God is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature. This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with [[immortality]]. One who has attained a correct knowledge of God has reached a condition of existence, which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and from death itself. Man is in a position to work out his own salvation and his immortality.\n\n[[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s doctrine of immortality was strikingly similar. But Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things ''sub specie \u00e6ternitatis'', while Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the [[Torah]] and the rabbinic understanding of the [[oral law]].\n\n====The Messianic era====\nPerhaps one of Maimonides's most highly acclaimed and renowned writings is his treatise on the Messianic era, written originally in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and which he elaborates on in great detail in his Commentary on the [[Mishnah]] (Introduction to the 10th chapter of [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]], also known as ''Pere\u1e33 \u1e24ele\u1e33'').

All of the Scriptural verses bear witness of him, and of us with him, but there is nothing which exists now that will change, excepting that the kingdom will be given over to Israel; thus have we heard it in the language used by the Sages: 'There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, excepting only the subjugation of kingdoms' <small>(San. 91b)</small>. There shall remain in his days, both, the strong and the weak, in comparison to others, only that in those days the people's livelihood will be made much easier for them, insofar that if a man should work any work no matter how short-lived, he will gain much thereby. This is that which they have spoken about, saying: 'In the future, the Land of Israel shall produce sweet-rolls of bread and clothes made of white woollen fabric' <small>(Shab. 30b)</small>, seeing that people will say whenever a man finds something ready [and prepared for use] in abundance that so-and-so has found baked bread and a cooked dish, the proof of which being what is written: 'And the sons of the stranger shall be your field workers and vine dressers' <small>(Isa. 61:5)</small>. Meaning, a time of ploughing and a time of reaping will be there; Wherefore, it was for this reason that that erudite man who said these things{{efn|name=a}} was angered at his disciple when he failed to understand their import and had thought rather that these things should be understood in their plain sense, and he was compelled to answer him in a way that he'd understand, even though that wasn't the proper response [to give him]. The evidence for this, ''viz''., that he didn't give him a truthful answer in accordance with what he learned of the verse, is this: 'Don't answer a foolish man in accordance with his folly' <small>(Proverbs 26:4)</small>.\n\t\nNow the greatest advantage at that time will be that we'll have rest from the subjugation of the wicked kingdom, which prevents us from performing that which God has enjoined unto us to do, while knowledge will be vastly increased, as it says: 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lo-rd' <small>(Isa. 11:9)</small>. Meanwhile, battles and wars will come to an end, as it says: 'Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation' <small>(Micha 4:3)</small>, while all those who will be in those days will attain to great perfection, by which he will merit the world to come. The Messiah will then die [as all men], and his son, and his son's son will rule after him. Now God has already described his death; he says: 'He shall not tire nor be weary, till he establish judgment in the earth: and the isles shall hope for his law' <small>(Isa. 42:4)</small>. His kingdom shall continue for a very long time, while the lives of men will also be prolonged; for by the absence of worries and troubles they shall prolong their lives. Neither should it seem strange that his kingdom will continue for thousands of years, inasmuch as the Sages have already said that no matter how noble the things that are collected together, when they are but few that are amassed together, they will fall apart. Nevertheless, we do not desire the days of the Messiah so that our grain and possessions might increase, or so that we can mount horses, or be engaged in revelry of drink and musical instruments, as those who are confused may think. Rather, the prophets fervently desired them and the pious men longed for them because of what shall be there of the ingathering of righteous men, and of proper conduct, and wisdom, and the uprightness of the king and his great wisdom and his drawing nigh unto the Creator, just as it was said of him: 'Thou art my son, [etc.]' <small>(Psalm 2:7)</small>, as well as the observance of the entire Law of Moses, without worries and without fear, and without constraint, just as He has promised 'And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD. For they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them' <small>(Jer. 31:33 [34])</small>; 'and I shall put my Law in their heart,' 'and I shall remove the heart of stone from your flesh' <small>(Ezek. 36:26)</small>, and there are many similar verses that speak of such matters. It is in this manner [that a man] will acquire the next world with a firm acquisition, while the desired end [of every man] is the world to come, and all that comes before it is [merely] human effort.\n\t\nWherefore, he that can perceive the truth has looked at the ultimate purpose of life and has forsaken all other things, whereby He says: 'All of Israel has a portion in the world to come.' Moreover, seeing that this is the desired end and purpose of one's life, it is not fitting that he who wishes to serve [his Maker] out of love should serve Him for the sole intent of attaining the next world, as we have premised earlier, but rather that he may serve Him in the manner that I shall prescribe, ''viz''., that if he has already come to believe that knowledge has been imparted unto the prophets from God, and that by it (i.e., that knowledge) He has revealed to them that the [coveted] virtues are such and such, and the faults are such and such, it behooves him, therefore, by reason of his being a moderate man of reason, to draw near to the virtues and to shun that which is deficient. If he has done this, Lo! He would have completed the mortal chapter [related to his existence], and he is then distinguished from the [brute] beasts; and since he would have become a [more] perfect man, one of the virtues of man is that no hindrance be found that will hinder him from attaining life for his soul in what is his remaining [spiritual] existence through her (i.e., the soul's) [continued] consciousness,{{efn|name=b}} and which is the world to come as we have explained.{{efn|name=c}}  Moreover, it is that which is said: 'Be ye not like a horse, [or] like a mule, which has no understanding; [who must be held back by bit and bridle]' <small>(Psalm 32:9)</small>, meaning, the thing that prevents them from idleness and uncontrollable conduct is an external thing like a bit and a bridle. May a man never be like this, but rather, let his soul be what stops him from acting in such a manner, that is to say, his [inner] human form{{efn|name=d}} [given to man by God at the hour of Creation] \u2013 if it were perfected, it will prevent him from whatever thing that withholds from him perfection (i.e., the betterment of his condition), which things are called deficiencies, but it will spurn him on in whatever is considered wholesome, which things are the virtues. This then is what has become clear unto me from all of their words relating to this noble matter, but things that can be easily misconstrued.\"{{efn|name=e}} \n\t\n</poem>\n----\n'''Notes:'''\n{{notelist|notes=\n{{efn|name=a|Rabban Gamliel; see: [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 30b}}\n{{efn|name=b|The Judeo-Arabic word used by Maimonides is \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d4\u05d0, or \"that which is known by her (i.e., by the soul),\" meaning, the ''ens intelligibile''.

Yosef Qafih), vol. 2, Rav Kook Institute, Jerusalem 1963 (Hebrew)}}\n}}\n|}\n|}\n\n====Resurrection====\n\nReligious Jews believed in immortality in a spiritual sense, and most believed that the future would include a messianic era and a resurrection of the dead. This is the subject of [[Jewish eschatology]]. Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually ''not'' about the resurrection of dead bodies. Rabbis of his day were critical of this aspect of this thought, and there was controversy over his true views.<ref>See: Maimonides's ''Ma'amar Te\u1e25ayyath Hamethim'' (Treatise on the Resurrection of the Dead), published in ''Book of Letters and Responsa'' (\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea), Jerusalem 1978, p. 9 (Hebrew). According to Maimonides, certain Jews in Yemen had sent to him a letter in the year 1189, evidently irritated as to why he had not mentioned the physical resurrection of the dead in his ''Hil. Teshuvah'', chapter 8, and how that some persons in Yemen had begun to instruct, based on Maimonides's teaching, that when the body dies it will disintegrate and the soul will never return to such bodies after death. Maimonides denied that he ever insinuated such things, and reiterated that the body would indeed resurrect, but that the \"world to come\" was something different in nature.</ref>\n\nEventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, known as \"The Treatise on Resurrection.\" In it, he wrote that those who claimed that he believed the verses of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] referring to the resurrection were only allegorical were spreading falsehoods.  Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement.<ref>Kraemer, 422</ref>\n\nWhile his position on the World to Come (non-corporeal eternal life as described above) may be seen as being in contradiction with his position on bodily resurrection, Maimonides resolved them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general. In his view, God never violates the laws of nature. Rather, divine interaction is by way of [[angel]]s, whom Maimonides often regards to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms. [This is not always the case. In Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah Chaps. 2\u20134, Maimonides describes angels that are actually created beings.] Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world's order.<ref>Commentary on the Mishna, Avot 5:6</ref>\n\nIn this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again. In his discussion of the [[Jewish principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], the first five deal with knowledge of God, the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption. In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection. All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual.\n\n===Maimonides and Kabbalah===\n\nIn ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', Maimonides declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of ''Sod'' <ref>Within [the Torah] there is also another part which is called \u2018hidden\u2019 (mutsna\u02bf), and this [concerns] the secrets (sodot) which the human intellect cannot attain, like the meanings of the statutes (\u1e25ukim) and other hidden secrets. They can neither be attained through the intellect nor through sheer volition, but they are revealed before Him who created [the Torah] (Rabbi [[Abraham ben Asher]], ''The Or ha-Sekhel'')</ref> esoteric meanings of Torah. The nature of these \"secrets\" is debated. Religious Jewish rationalists, and the mainstream academic view, read Maimonides' Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to [[Kabbalah]].<ref>Such as the first (religious) criticism of Kabbalah, ''Ari Nohem'', by [[Leon Modena]] from 1639. In it, Modena urges a return to Maimonidean Aristotelianism. ''The Scandal of Kabbalah: Leon Modena, Jewish Mysticism, Early Modern Venice'', Yaacob Dweck, Princeton University Press, 2011.</ref> Some academics hold that Maimonides' project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.<ref>Menachem Kellner, ''Maimonides' Confrontation With Mysticism'', Littman Library, 2006</ref> However, Kabbalists and their heirs read Maimonides according to Kabbalah or as an actual covert subscriber to Kabbalah.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/107784/jewish/Philosopher-and-Mystic.htm Maimonides: Philosopher and Mystic] from ''Chabad.org''</ref> According to this, he employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit inquiry of ''Sod'' only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition,<ref>Contemporary academic views in the study of Jewish mysticism, hold that 12-13th century Kabbalists wrote down and systemised their transmitted oral doctrines in oppositional response to Maimonidean rationalism. See e.g. Moshe Idel, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives''</ref> also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|corporeal]] interpretations that could have been made from [[Heichalot|earlier Jewish mysticism]],<ref>The first comprehensive systemiser of Kabbalah, [[Moshe Cordovero]], for example, was influenced by Maimonides. One example is his instruction to undercut any conception of a Kabbalistic idea after grasping it in the mind. One's intellect runs to God in learning the idea, then returns back in qualified rejection of false spatial/temporal conceptions of the idea's truth, as the human mind can only think in material references. Cited in Louis Jacobs, ''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', Oxford University Press, 1995, entry on Cordovero</ref> though Kabbalists held that their theosophy alone allowed human access to Divine mysteries.<ref>Norman Lamm, ''The Religious Thought of Hasidism: Text and Commentary'', Ktav Pub, 1999: Introduction to chapter on Faith/Reason has historical overview of religious reasons for opposition to Jewish philosophy, including the Ontological reason, one Medieval Kabbalist holding that \"we begin where they end\"</ref>\n\n===''The Oath of Maimonides''===\nThe ''[[Oath of Maimonides]]'' is a document about the medical calling and recited as a substitute for the ''[[Oath of Hippocrates]]''. The ''Oath'' is not to be confused with a more lengthy ''Prayer of Maimonides''.

Some people believe that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's formation; but every one can easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient so as to require external completion, especially as the use of the fore-skin to that organ is evident. This commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient physical creation, but as a means for perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The [degree of] bodily damage caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment: the organ necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is deprived of its covering from the beginning, and our Sages (Beresh. Rabba, c. 80) say distinctly: It is hard for a woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse, to separate from him. [Tempering lust] is, as I believe, the best reason for the commandment concerning circumcision. And who was the first to perform this commandment? Abraham, our father! of whom it is well known how he feared sin; it is described by our Sages in reference to the words, \"Behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon\" (Gen. xii. 11). There is, however, another important object in this commandment. It gives to all members of the same faith, i.e., to all believers in the Unity of God, a common bodily sign, so that it is impossible for any one that is a stranger, to say that he belongs to them. For sometimes people say so for the purpose of obtaining some advantage, or in order to make some attack upon the Jews. No one, however, should circumcise himself or his son for any other reason but pure faith; for circumcision is not like an incision on the leg, or a burning in the arm, but a very difficult operation. It is also a fact that there is much mutual love and assistance among people that are united by the same sign when they consider it as [the symbol of] a covenant. Circumcision is likewise the [symbol of the] covenant which Abraham made in connexion with the belief in God's Unity. So also every one that is circumcised enters the covenant of Abraham to believe in the unity of God, in accordance with the words of the Law, \"To be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee\" (Gen. xvii. 7). This purpose of the circumcision is as important as the first, and perhaps more important.|sign=Maimonides|source=''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]'' (1190)}}\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides.jpg|thumb|The title page of ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'']]\nMaimonides' ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' is considered by Jews even today as one of the chief authoritative codifications of Jewish law and ethics. It is exceptional for its logical construction, concise and clear expression and extraordinary learning, so that it became a standard against which other later codifications were often measured.<ref>Isidore Twersky, ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, \"Epilogue,\" pp. 515\u2013538.</ref> It is still closely studied in rabbinic yeshivot (academies). A popular medieval saying that also served as his [[epitaph]] states, ''From [[Moses|Mosheh]] (of the Torah) to Mosheh (Maimonides) there was none like Mosheh.'' It chiefly referred to his rabbinic writings.\n\nBut Maimonides was also one of the most influential figures in medieval Jewish philosophy. His brilliant adaptation of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian thought]] to Biblical faith deeply impressed later Jewish thinkers, and had an unexpected immediate historical impact.<ref>This is covered in all histories of the Jews. E.g., including such a brief overview as Cecil Roth, ''A History of the Jews'', Revised Edition (New York: Schocken, 1970), pp. 175\u2013179.</ref> Some more acculturated Jews in the century that followed his death, particularly in Spain, sought to apply Maimonides's Aristotelianism in ways that undercut traditionalist belief and observance, giving rise to an intellectual controversy in Spanish and southern French Jewish circles.<ref>D.J. Silver, ''Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180\u20131240'' (Leiden: Brill, 1965), is still the most detailed account.</ref> The intensity of debate spurred Catholic Church interventions against \"heresy\" and a general confiscation of rabbinic texts. In reaction, the more radical interpretations of Maimonides were defeated. At least amongst Ashkenazi Jews, there was a tendency to ignore his specifically philosophical writings and to stress instead the rabbinic and halakhic writings. These writings often included considerable philosophical chapters or discussions in support of halakhic observance; David Hartman observes that Maimonides clearly expressed \"the traditional support for a philosophical understanding of God both in the Aggadah of Talmud and in the behavior of the hasid [the pious Jew].\"<ref>David Hartman, ''Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1976), p. 98.</ref> Maimonidean thought continues to influence traditionally observant Jews.<ref>On the extensive philosophical aspects of Maimonides's halakhic works, see in particular Isidore Twersky's ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980).

Also see Colette Sirat, ''A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 205\u2013272.</ref>\n\nThe most rigorous medieval critique of Maimonides is [[Hasdai Crescas]]'s ''[[Or Adonai]]''. Crescas bucked the eclectic trend, by demolishing the certainty of the Aristotelian world-view, not only in religious matters but also in the most basic areas of medieval science (such as physics and geometry). Crescas's critique provoked a number of 15th-century scholars to write defenses of Maimonides. A partial translation of Crescas was produced by [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1929.\n\nBecause of his path-finding synthesis of Aristotle and Biblical faith, Maimonides had a fundamental influence on the great Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Mercedes Rubio|title=Aquinas and Maimonides on the possibility of the knowledge of god |pages=65\u2013126 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-4747-9_2 |isbn=978-1-4020-4720-6|chapter=Aquinas and Maimonides on the Divine Names }}</ref> Aquinas refers specifically to Maimonides in several of his works, including the ''[[Commentary on the Sentences]]''.\n\nMaimonides's combined abilities in the fields of theology, philosophy and medicine make his work attractive today as a source during discussions of evolving norms in these fields, particularly medicine.

[[Judeo-Arabic language]] in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters.]]\nMaimonides composed works of Jewish scholarship, [[halakhah|rabbinic law]], philosophy, and medical texts. Most of Maimonides's works were written in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]. However, the ''Mishneh Torah'' was written in Hebrew. His Jewish texts were:\n* ''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'' (Hebrew ''Pirush Hamishnayot'', Arabic ''Kitab al-Siraj''),  written in Judeo-Arabic. This was the first full commentary ever written on the entire Mishnah, and it enjoyed great popularity both in its Arabic original and its medieval Hebrew translation. The commentary includes three philosophical introductions which were also highly influential:\n** The Introduction to the Mishnah deals with the nature of the oral law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah.\n** The Introduction to Mishnah Sanhedrin, chapter ten (''Perek Helek''), is an eschatological essay that concludes with Maimonides's famous creed (\"the thirteen principles of faith\").\n** The Introduction to Tractate ''Avot'' (popularly called ''The Eight Chapters'') is an ethical treatise.\n* ''[[Sefer Hamitzvot]]'' (trans. ''The Book of Commandments''). In this work, Maimonides lists all the 613 mitzvot traditionally contained in the Torah (Pentateuch). He describes fourteen shorashim (roots or principles) to guide his selection.\n* Sefer Ha'shamad (letter of Martydom)\n* ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', a comprehensive [[code of law|code]] of Jewish law. It is also known as ''Yad ha-Chazaka'' or simply Yad/\"\u05d9\u05d3\" which has the numerical value 14, representing the 14 sections of the book.\n* ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', a philosophical work harmonising and differentiating Aristotle's philosophy and Jewish theology.

The work illustrates the essentials of Aristotelian logic to be found in the teachings of the great [[List of Muslim philosophers|Islamic philosophers]] such as Avicenna and, above all, [[Al-Farabi]], \"the Second Master,\" the \"First Master\" being [[Aristotle]]. In his work devoted to the Treatise, [[R\u00e9mi Brague]] stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein. This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Al-Farabi's works on logic. In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called ''The words of Logic'' which describes the bulk of the work. The author explains the technical meaning of the words used by logicians. The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to. The work proceeds rationally through a lexicon of philosophical terms to a summary of higher philosophical topics, in 14 chapters corresponding to Maimonides's birthdate of 14 Nissan. The number 14 recurs in many of Maimonides's works. Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions. The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples. At the end of each chapter, the author carefully draws up the list of words studied.\n\nUntil very recently, it was accepted that Maimonides wrote the ''Treatise on logic'' in his twenties or even in his teen<ref>Abraham Heschel, ''Maimonides''.

Maimon, of blessed memory, had been taken up (i.e. euphemism for \"had died\"), in the year [4],965 [[anno mundi]] (= 1204/5 CE) in Egypt, and the Jews wept for him \u2013 as did [all] the Egyptians \u2013 three days, and they coined a name for that time of year, [saying], 'there was wailing,' and on the seventh day [of his passing], the news reached Alexandria, and on the eighth day, [the news reached] Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem they made a great public mourning [on his behalf] and called for a fast and public gathering, where it was that the prayer precentor read out the admonitions, 'If you shall walk in my statutes [etc.]' (Leviticus 26:3-ff.), as well as read the concluding verse [from the Prophets], 'And it came to pass that Samuel spoke to all of Israel [etc.],' and he then concluded by saying that the Ark of God had been taken away. Now after certain days they brought up his coffin to the Land of Israel, during which journey thieves encountered them, causing those who had gone up to flee, leaving there the coffin. Now the thieves, when they saw that they had all fled, they desired to have the coffin cast into the sea, but were unable with all their strength to uproot the coffin from the ground, even though they had been more than thirty men, and when they considered the matter, they then said to themselves that he was a godly and holy man, and so they went their way. However, they gave assurances to the Jews that they would escort them to their destination, and so it was that they also accompanied him and '''he was buried in Tiberias'''.\"</ref>\n\nDuring his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides' writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, even as far away as Iraq and Yemen. Yet, while Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish community in Egypt]], his writings also had vociferous critics, particularly in Spain. Nonetheless, he was posthumously acknowledged as among the foremost rabbinical [[Posek|decisors]] and philosophers in [[Jewish history]], and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of [[Talmud]]ic law. He is sometimes known as \"ha Nesher ha Gadol\" (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a ''bona fide'' exponent of the [[Oral Torah]].\n\nAside from being revered by Jewish historians, Maimonides also figures very prominently in the history of Islamic and Arab sciences and is mentioned extensively in studies.

They summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism:\n# The [[existence of God]].\n# God's [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|unity]] and indivisibility into elements.\n# God's [[spirituality]] and [[incorporeal]]ity.\n# God's [[eternity]].\n# [[God in Judaism#To God alone may one offer prayer|God alone]] should be the object of [[worship]].\n# [[Revelation]] through God's [[prophet]]s.\n# The preeminence of [[Moses]] among the prophets.\n# That the entire Torah (both the Written and Oral law) are of Divine origin and were dictated to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai.\n# The [[Torah]] given by Moses is permanent and will not be replaced or changed.\n# God's awareness of all human actions and thoughts.\n# Reward of righteousness and punishment of evil.\n# The coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]].\n# The [[resurrection of the dead]].\n\nMaimonides compiled the principles from various Talmudic sources. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbis [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]], and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries.<ref>''Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought'', Menachem Kellner</ref> However, these principles have become widely held and are considered to be the cardinal principals of faith for [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm|title=The Thirteen Principles of Jewish Faith|website=www.chabad.org}}</ref><ref>See, for example: [[Marc B.

Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (2011). pp. 1\u201314.</ref> Two poetic restatements of these principles (''[[Ani Ma'amin]]'' and ''[[Yigdal]]'') eventually became canonized in many editions of the \"[[Siddur]]\" (Jewish prayer book).\n\n==Legal works==\n{{main article|Mishneh Torah}}\nWith ''Mishneh Torah'', Maimonides composed a code of [[Jewish law]] with the widest-possible scope and depth. The work gathers all the binding laws from the [[Talmud]], and incorporates the positions of the [[Geonim]] (post-Talmudic early Medieval scholars, mainly from [[Mesopotamia]]).\n\nLater codes of Jewish law, e.g. [[Arba'ah Turim]] by Rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] and [[Shulchan Aruch]] by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], draw heavily on ''Mishneh Torah'': both often quote whole sections verbatim. However, it met initially with much opposition.<ref>Siegelbaum, Chana Bracha (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4HVwBMI5zK0C&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq=Mishneh+Torah+met+initially+opposition&source=bl&ots=p7VTtHovyS&sig=_ntA1Qo23D9AQ5MvoggZ9194Tg4&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAmoVChMIldLSte66xwIVghyQCh22dA_s#v=onepage&q=Mishneh%20Torah%20met%20initially%20opposition&f=false ''Women at the crossroads : a woman's perspective on the weekly Torah portion''] Gush Etzion: Midreshet B'erot Bat Ayin. {{ISBN|9781936068098}} page 199</ref> There were two main reasons for this opposition. First, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; second, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to \"cut out\" study of the Talmud,<ref>Last section of Maimonides's Introduction to Mishneh Torah</ref> to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law, although Maimonides later wrote that this was not his intent. His most forceful opponents were the rabbis of [[Provence]] (Southern France), and a running critique by Rabbi [[Abraham ben David]] (Raavad III) is printed in virtually all editions of ''Mishneh Torah''.  It was still recognized as a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of [[halakha]]. Throughout the centuries, it has been widely studied and its halakhic decisions have weighed heavily in later rulings.\n\nIn response to those who would attempt to force followers of Maimonides and his ''Mishneh Torah'' to abide by the rulings of his own [[Shulchan Aruch]] or other later works, Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] wrote: \"Who would dare force communities who follow the Rambam to follow any other decisor, early or late? \u2026 The Rambam is the greatest of the decisors, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabistan]] and the [[Maghreb]] practice according to his word, and accepted him as their rabbi.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=636&pgnum=70 |title=Avkat Rochel ch. 32 }}</ref>\n\nAn oft-cited legal maxim from his pen is: \"[[Blackstone's formulation|It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death]].\"  He argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely according to the judge's caprice.<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg.

''The Survival of the Chinese Jews; The Jewish Community of Kaifeng''. T\u02bboung pao, 10. Leiden: Brill, 1972, p. 157</ref> Beyond scriptural similarities, Michael Pollak comments the Jews' [[Pentateuch]] was divided into 53 sections according to the Persian style.<ref>Pollak, Michael. ''Mandarins, Jews, and Missionaries: The Jewish Experience in the Chinese Empire''. The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1980, p. 413</ref> He also points out:\n\n{{quote|There is no proof, to be sure, that Kaifeng Jewry ever had direct access to the works of \"the Great Eagle,\" but it would have had ample time and opportunity to acquire or become acquainted with them well before its reservoir of Jewish learning began to run out. Nor do the Maimonidean leanings of the ''{{linktext|kehillah}}'' contradict the historical evidence that has the Jews arriving in [[Kaifeng]] no later than 1126, the year in which [[Jingkang Incident|the Sung fled the city]]\u2014and nine years before Maimonides was born. In 1163, when the ''kehillah'' built the first of its synagogues, Maimonides was only twenty-eight years old, so that it is highly unlikely that even his earliest authoritative teachings could by then have reached China.<ref>Pollak, ''Mandarins, Jews, and Missionaries'', pp. 297\u2013298</ref>}}\n\n===Tzedakah (charity)===\nOne of the most widely referred to sections of the ''Mishneh Torah'' is the section dealing with [[tzedakah]]. In Hilkhot Matanot Aniyim (Laws about Giving to Poor People), Chapter 10:7\u201314, Maimonides lists his famous Eight Levels of Giving (where the first level is most preferable, and the eighth the least):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dannysiegel.com/maimonides_8_degrees.pdf |title=Hebrew Source of Maimonides's Levels of Giving with Danny Siegel's translation |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>\n\n# Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need; so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.\n# Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person (or public fund) which is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion.\n# Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient.\n# Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient.\n# Giving tzedakah before being asked.\n# Giving adequately after being asked.\n# Giving willingly, but inadequately.\n# Giving \"in sadness\" (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say \"Giving unwillingly.\"\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[File:Measure of men.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Maimonides teaching students about the 'measure of man' in an [[illuminated manuscript]].]]\nThrough the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (which was initially written in Arabic as ''Dal\u0101lat al-\u1e25\u0101\u02beir\u012bn'') and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers, especially on [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. He was a Jewish Scholastic. Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of Aristotle. Maimonides strove to reconcile [[wikt:Aristotelian|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy]] and science with the teachings of the [[Bible|Torah]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=The Guide to the Perplexed|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3963/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> In his ''Guide for the Perplexed'', he often explains the function and purpose of the statutory provisions contained in the Torah against the backdrop of the historical conditions. Maimonides is said to have been influenced by [[Asaph ha-Jehoudi]], who was the first [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] medical writer.\n\n===Theology===\nMaimonides equated the [[God in Judaism|God of Abraham]] to what philosophers refer to as the [[necessary being|Necessary Being]].  God is unique in the universe, and the Torah commands that one love and fear God (Deut 10:12) on account of that uniqueness.  To Maimonides, this meant that one ought to contemplate God's works and to marvel at the order and wisdom that went into their creation.  When one does this, one inevitably comes to love God and to sense how insignificant one is in comparison to God.  This is the basis of the Torah.<ref>Kraemer, 326-8</ref>\n\nThe principle that inspired his philosophical activity was identical to a fundamental tenet of [[scholasticism]]: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy. Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of Aristotle and the teachings of the Talmud, commonly finding basis in the former for the latter.<ref>Kraemer, 66</ref>\n\nMaimonides' admiration for the [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] commentators led him to doctrines which the later Scholastics did not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of \"[[negative theology]]\" (also known as \"Apophatic theology\".) In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes. For instance, one should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; it can be said that God is not non-existent. We should not say that \"God is wise\"; but we can say that \"God is not ignorant,\" i.e., in some way, God has some properties of knowledge. We should not say that \"God is One,\" but we can state that \"there is no multiplicity in God's being.\" In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of God by describing what God is not, rather than by describing what God \"is.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\">Robinson, George.  [https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/maimonides-conception-of-god/ \"Maimonides\u2019 Conception of God/\"] ''My Jewish Learning''.  30 April 2018.</ref>\n\nMaimonides argued adamantly that God is not corporeal.  This was central to his thinking about the sin of [[idolatry]].  Maimonides insisted that all of the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] phrases pertaining to God in sacred texts are to be interpreted [[metaphorically]].<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\n===Character development===\n{{see also|Golden mean (Judaism)}}\nMaimonides taught about the developing one's [[moral character]].  Although his life predated the modern concept of a [[personality]], Maimonides believed that each person has an innate disposition along an ethical and emotional spectrum.  Although one's disposition is often determined by factors outside of one's control, human beings have [[free will]] to choose to behave in ways that build character.<ref>Telushkin, 29</ref> He wrote, \"One is obligated to conduct his affairs with others in a gentle and pleasing manner.\"<ref>Commentary on ''The Ethics of the Fathers'' 1:15.  Qtd. in Telushkin, 115</ref> Maimonides advised those with anti-social character traits ought to identify those traits and then make a conscious effort to behave in the opposite way.  For example, an arrogant person should practice humility.<ref>Kraemer, 332-4</ref> If the circumstances of one's environment are such that it is impossible to behave ethically, one must move to a new location.<ref>MT ''De'ot'' 6:1</ref>\n\n===Prophecy===\nHe agrees with \"the Philosopher\" (Aristotle) in teaching that the use of logic is the \"right\" way of thinking. In order to build an inner understanding of how to know God, every human being must, by study, meditation and uncompromising strong will, attain the degree of complete logical, spiritual and physical perfection required in the [[prophet]]ic state. Here he rejects previous ideas (especially portrayed by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi in \"Hakuzari\") that in order to become a prophet, God must intervene. Maimonides claims that any man or woman<ref>\"Maimonides believed that women were capable of being instructed in Talmud and even that women can be prophetesses.\" Kraemer, 336</ref> has the potential to become a prophet (not just Jews) and that in fact it is the purpose of the human race.\n\n===The problem of evil===\nMaimonides wrote on [[theodicy]] (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a God with the existence of evil). He took the premise that an omnipotent and good God exists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Moses Maimonides|title=The Guide to the Perplexed|year=2007|publisher=BN Publishers}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Joseph Jacobs|title=Moses Ben Maimon|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&letter=M&search=maimonides#ixzz1GVE5kJqV |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Shlomo Pines|title=Maimonides (1135\u20131204)|journal=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006|volume=5|pages=647\u2013654}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Isadore Twersky|title=Maimonides, Moses|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2005|volume=8|pages=5613\u20135618}}</ref> In his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', Maimonides writes that all the evil that exists within human beings stems from their individual attributes, while all good comes from a universally shared humanity (Guide 3:8). He says that there are people who are guided by higher purpose, and there are those who are guided by physicality and must strive to find the higher purpose with which to guide their actions.\n\nTo justify the existence of evil, assuming God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, Maimonides postulates that one who created something by causing its opposite not to exist is not the same as creating something that exists; so evil is merely the absence of good. God did not create evil, rather God created good, and evil exists where good is absent (Guide 3:10). Therefore, all good is divine invention, and evil both is not and comes secondarily.\n\nMaimonides contests the common view that evil outweighs good in the world. He says that if one were to examine existence only in terms of humanity, then that person may observe evil to dominate good, but if one looks at the whole of the universe, then he sees good is significantly more common than evil (Guide 3:12). Man, he reasons, is too insignificant a figure in God's myriad works to be their primary characterizing force, and so when people see mostly evil in their lives, they are not taking into account the extent of positive Creation outside of themselves.\n\nMaimonides believes that there are three types of evil in the world: evil caused by nature, evil that people bring upon others, and evil man brings upon himself (Guide 3:12). The first type of evil Maimonides states is the rarest form, but arguably of the most necessary\u2014the balance of life and death in both the human and animal worlds itself, he recognizes, is essential to God's plan. Maimonides writes that the second type of evil is relatively rare, and that humanity brings it upon itself. The third type of evil humans bring upon themselves and is the source of most of the ills of the world. These are the result of people falling victim to their physical desires. To prevent the majority of evil which stems from harm we do to ourselves, we must learn how to ignore our bodily urges.\n\n===Skepticism of astrology===\n{{further information|Jewish views on astrology}}\nMaimonides answered an inquiry concerning astrology, addressed to him from [[Marseille]].<ref>Joel E. Kramer, \"Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait,\" p. 45. In {{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides |editor=Kenneth Seeskin |date=September 2005 |isbn=9780521525787}}</ref> He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he had studied astrology, and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. He ridicules the concept that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose, and would make man a slave of destiny.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rudavsky|first1=T.|title=Maimonidies|date=March 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-4898-6|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===True beliefs versus necessary beliefs===\nIn ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Book III, Chapter 28,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp164.htm |title=Guide for the Perplexed, on |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Maimonides draws a distinction between \"true beliefs,\" which were beliefs about God that produced intellectual perfection, and \"necessary beliefs,\" which were conducive to improving social order. Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about God in the latter class.  He uses as an example the notion that God becomes \"angry\" with people who do wrong.  In the view of Maimonides (taken from [[Avicenna]]), God does not become angry with people, as God has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe God does, so that they desist from doing wrong.\n\n===Eschatology===\n{{see also|Jewish eschatology}}\n====The World to Come====\nMaimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal [[active intellect]]; this is his interpretation of the ''no\u00fbs poietik\u00f3s'' of Aristotelian philosophy. It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of God.\n\nThe knowledge of God is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature. This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with [[immortality]]. One who has attained a correct knowledge of God has reached a condition of existence, which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and from death itself. Man is in a position to work out his own salvation and his immortality.\n\n[[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s doctrine of immortality was strikingly similar. But Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things ''sub specie \u00e6ternitatis'', while Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the [[Torah]] and the rabbinic understanding of the [[oral law]].\n\n====The Messianic era====\nPerhaps one of Maimonides's most highly acclaimed and renowned writings is his treatise on the Messianic era, written originally in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and which he elaborates on in great detail in his Commentary on the [[Mishnah]] (Introduction to the 10th chapter of [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]], also known as ''Pere\u1e33 \u1e24ele\u1e33'').

Full text of '''Maimonides on the Messianic Era'''\n|-\n|\t\n{|class=\"toccolours\"\n|+ '''Maimonides on the Messianic Era'''\n|<poem>[[Mishnah]] Commentary\nTractate Sanhedrin\n''Pere\u1e33 \u1e24ele\u1e33'' (Chapter 10)\n\"\u2026 'The days of the Messiah' (i.e., the Messianic Era) is a timeframe in which the kingdom shall return to Israel, and they (i.e., the people of Israel) will return to the Land of Israel, and the king who shall stand-up will establish the place of his kingdom in Zion, whose name shall be extolled and it will reach unto the ends of the earth, being [even] greater than Solomon's kingdom, and the nations will enter a covenant of peace with him, and all lands shall serve him on account of the abundance of his righteousness, and for the wondrous things that shall be revealed through him; whosoever shall rise-up against him, the Lord will cut him off and deliver him into his hands. All of the Scriptural verses bear witness of him, and of us with him, but there is nothing which exists now that will change, excepting that the kingdom will be given over to Israel; thus have we heard it in the language used by the Sages: 'There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, excepting only the subjugation of kingdoms' <small>(San. 91b)</small>. There shall remain in his days, both, the strong and the weak, in comparison to others, only that in those days the people's livelihood will be made much easier for them, insofar that if a man should work any work no matter how short-lived, he will gain much thereby. This is that which they have spoken about, saying: 'In the future, the Land of Israel shall produce sweet-rolls of bread and clothes made of white woollen fabric' <small>(Shab. 30b)</small>, seeing that people will say whenever a man finds something ready [and prepared for use] in abundance that so-and-so has found baked bread and a cooked dish, the proof of which being what is written: 'And the sons of the stranger shall be your field workers and vine dressers' <small>(Isa. 61:5)</small>. Meaning, a time of ploughing and a time of reaping will be there; Wherefore, it was for this reason that that erudite man who said these things{{efn|name=a}} was angered at his disciple when he failed to understand their import and had thought rather that these things should be understood in their plain sense, and he was compelled to answer him in a way that he'd understand, even though that wasn't the proper response [to give him]. The evidence for this, ''viz''., that he didn't give him a truthful answer in accordance with what he learned of the verse, is this: 'Don't answer a foolish man in accordance with his folly' <small>(Proverbs 26:4)</small>.\n\t\nNow the greatest advantage at that time will be that we'll have rest from the subjugation of the wicked kingdom, which prevents us from performing that which God has enjoined unto us to do, while knowledge will be vastly increased, as it says: 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lo-rd' <small>(Isa. 11:9)</small>. Meanwhile, battles and wars will come to an end, as it says: 'Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation' <small>(Micha 4:3)</small>, while all those who will be in those days will attain to great perfection, by which he will merit the world to come. The Messiah will then die [as all men], and his son, and his son's son will rule after him. Now God has already described his death; he says: 'He shall not tire nor be weary, till he establish judgment in the earth: and the isles shall hope for his law' <small>(Isa. 42:4)</small>. His kingdom shall continue for a very long time, while the lives of men will also be prolonged; for by the absence of worries and troubles they shall prolong their lives. Neither should it seem strange that his kingdom will continue for thousands of years, inasmuch as the Sages have already said that no matter how noble the things that are collected together, when they are but few that are amassed together, they will fall apart. Nevertheless, we do not desire the days of the Messiah so that our grain and possessions might increase, or so that we can mount horses, or be engaged in revelry of drink and musical instruments, as those who are confused may think. Rather, the prophets fervently desired them and the pious men longed for them because of what shall be there of the ingathering of righteous men, and of proper conduct, and wisdom, and the uprightness of the king and his great wisdom and his drawing nigh unto the Creator, just as it was said of him: 'Thou art my son, [etc.]' <small>(Psalm 2:7)</small>, as well as the observance of the entire Law of Moses, without worries and without fear, and without constraint, just as He has promised 'And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD. For they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them' <small>(Jer. 31:33 [34])</small>; 'and I shall put my Law in their heart,' 'and I shall remove the heart of stone from your flesh' <small>(Ezek. 36:26)</small>, and there are many similar verses that speak of such matters. It is in this manner [that a man] will acquire the next world with a firm acquisition, while the desired end [of every man] is the world to come, and all that comes before it is [merely] human effort.\n\t\nWherefore, he that can perceive the truth has looked at the ultimate purpose of life and has forsaken all other things, whereby He says: 'All of Israel has a portion in the world to come.' Moreover, seeing that this is the desired end and purpose of one's life, it is not fitting that he who wishes to serve [his Maker] out of love should serve Him for the sole intent of attaining the next world, as we have premised earlier, but rather that he may serve Him in the manner that I shall prescribe, ''viz''., that if he has already come to believe that knowledge has been imparted unto the prophets from God, and that by it (i.e., that knowledge) He has revealed to them that the [coveted] virtues are such and such, and the faults are such and such, it behooves him, therefore, by reason of his being a moderate man of reason, to draw near to the virtues and to shun that which is deficient. If he has done this, Lo! He would have completed the mortal chapter [related to his existence], and he is then distinguished from the [brute] beasts; and since he would have become a [more] perfect man, one of the virtues of man is that no hindrance be found that will hinder him from attaining life for his soul in what is his remaining [spiritual] existence through her (i.e., the soul's) [continued] consciousness,{{efn|name=b}} and which is the world to come as we have explained.{{efn|name=c}}  Moreover, it is that which is said: 'Be ye not like a horse, [or] like a mule, which has no understanding; [who must be held back by bit and bridle]' <small>(Psalm 32:9)</small>, meaning, the thing that prevents them from idleness and uncontrollable conduct is an external thing like a bit and a bridle. May a man never be like this, but rather, let his soul be what stops him from acting in such a manner, that is to say, his [inner] human form{{efn|name=d}} [given to man by God at the hour of Creation] \u2013 if it were perfected, it will prevent him from whatever thing that withholds from him perfection (i.e., the betterment of his condition), which things are called deficiencies, but it will spurn him on in whatever is considered wholesome, which things are the virtues. This then is what has become clear unto me from all of their words relating to this noble matter, but things that can be easily misconstrued.\"{{efn|name=e}} \n\t\n</poem>\n----\n'''Notes:'''\n{{notelist|notes=\n{{efn|name=a|Rabban Gamliel; see: [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 30b}}\n{{efn|name=b|The Judeo-Arabic word used by Maimonides is \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d4\u05d0, or \"that which is known by her (i.e., by the soul),\" meaning, the ''ens intelligibile''.

Yosef Qafih), vol. 2, Rav Kook Institute, Jerusalem 1963 (Hebrew)}}\n}}\n|}\n|}\n\n====Resurrection====\n\nReligious Jews believed in immortality in a spiritual sense, and most believed that the future would include a messianic era and a resurrection of the dead. This is the subject of [[Jewish eschatology]]. Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually ''not'' about the resurrection of dead bodies. Rabbis of his day were critical of this aspect of this thought, and there was controversy over his true views.<ref>See: Maimonides's ''Ma'amar Te\u1e25ayyath Hamethim'' (Treatise on the Resurrection of the Dead), published in ''Book of Letters and Responsa'' (\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea), Jerusalem 1978, p. 9 (Hebrew). According to Maimonides, certain Jews in Yemen had sent to him a letter in the year 1189, evidently irritated as to why he had not mentioned the physical resurrection of the dead in his ''Hil. Teshuvah'', chapter 8, and how that some persons in Yemen had begun to instruct, based on Maimonides's teaching, that when the body dies it will disintegrate and the soul will never return to such bodies after death. Maimonides denied that he ever insinuated such things, and reiterated that the body would indeed resurrect, but that the \"world to come\" was something different in nature.</ref>\n\nEventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, known as \"The Treatise on Resurrection.\" In it, he wrote that those who claimed that he believed the verses of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] referring to the resurrection were only allegorical were spreading falsehoods.  Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement.<ref>Kraemer, 422</ref>\n\nWhile his position on the World to Come (non-corporeal eternal life as described above) may be seen as being in contradiction with his position on bodily resurrection, Maimonides resolved them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general. In his view, God never violates the laws of nature. Rather, divine interaction is by way of [[angel]]s, whom Maimonides often regards to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms. [This is not always the case. In Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah Chaps. 2\u20134, Maimonides describes angels that are actually created beings.] Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world's order.<ref>Commentary on the Mishna, Avot 5:6</ref>\n\nIn this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again. In his discussion of the [[Jewish principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], the first five deal with knowledge of God, the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption. In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection. All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual.\n\n===Maimonides and Kabbalah===\n\nIn ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', Maimonides declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of ''Sod'' <ref>Within [the Torah] there is also another part which is called \u2018hidden\u2019 (mutsna\u02bf), and this [concerns] the secrets (sodot) which the human intellect cannot attain, like the meanings of the statutes (\u1e25ukim) and other hidden secrets. They can neither be attained through the intellect nor through sheer volition, but they are revealed before Him who created [the Torah] (Rabbi [[Abraham ben Asher]], ''The Or ha-Sekhel'')</ref> esoteric meanings of Torah. The nature of these \"secrets\" is debated. Religious Jewish rationalists, and the mainstream academic view, read Maimonides' Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to [[Kabbalah]].<ref>Such as the first (religious) criticism of Kabbalah, ''Ari Nohem'', by [[Leon Modena]] from 1639. In it, Modena urges a return to Maimonidean Aristotelianism. ''The Scandal of Kabbalah: Leon Modena, Jewish Mysticism, Early Modern Venice'', Yaacob Dweck, Princeton University Press, 2011.</ref> Some academics hold that Maimonides' project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.<ref>Menachem Kellner, ''Maimonides' Confrontation With Mysticism'', Littman Library, 2006</ref> However, Kabbalists and their heirs read Maimonides according to Kabbalah or as an actual covert subscriber to Kabbalah.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/107784/jewish/Philosopher-and-Mystic.htm Maimonides: Philosopher and Mystic] from ''Chabad.org''</ref> According to this, he employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit inquiry of ''Sod'' only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition,<ref>Contemporary academic views in the study of Jewish mysticism, hold that 12-13th century Kabbalists wrote down and systemised their transmitted oral doctrines in oppositional response to Maimonidean rationalism. See e.g. Moshe Idel, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives''</ref> also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|corporeal]] interpretations that could have been made from [[Heichalot|earlier Jewish mysticism]],<ref>The first comprehensive systemiser of Kabbalah, [[Moshe Cordovero]], for example, was influenced by Maimonides. One example is his instruction to undercut any conception of a Kabbalistic idea after grasping it in the mind. One's intellect runs to God in learning the idea, then returns back in qualified rejection of false spatial/temporal conceptions of the idea's truth, as the human mind can only think in material references.

Some people believe that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's formation; but every one can easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient so as to require external completion, especially as the use of the fore-skin to that organ is evident. This commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient physical creation, but as a means for perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The [degree of] bodily damage caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment: the organ necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is deprived of its covering from the beginning, and our Sages (Beresh. Rabba, c. 80) say distinctly: It is hard for a woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse, to separate from him. [Tempering lust] is, as I believe, the best reason for the commandment concerning circumcision. And who was the first to perform this commandment? Abraham, our father! of whom it is well known how he feared sin; it is described by our Sages in reference to the words, \"Behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon\" (Gen. xii. 11). There is, however, another important object in this commandment. It gives to all members of the same faith, i.e., to all believers in the Unity of God, a common bodily sign, so that it is impossible for any one that is a stranger, to say that he belongs to them. For sometimes people say so for the purpose of obtaining some advantage, or in order to make some attack upon the Jews. No one, however, should circumcise himself or his son for any other reason but pure faith; for circumcision is not like an incision on the leg, or a burning in the arm, but a very difficult operation. It is also a fact that there is much mutual love and assistance among people that are united by the same sign when they consider it as [the symbol of] a covenant. Circumcision is likewise the [symbol of the] covenant which Abraham made in connexion with the belief in God's Unity. So also every one that is circumcised enters the covenant of Abraham to believe in the unity of God, in accordance with the words of the Law, \"To be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee\" (Gen. xvii. 7). This purpose of the circumcision is as important as the first, and perhaps more important.|sign=Maimonides|source=''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]'' (1190)}}\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides.jpg|thumb|The title page of ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'']]\nMaimonides' ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' is considered by Jews even today as one of the chief authoritative codifications of Jewish law and ethics. It is exceptional for its logical construction, concise and clear expression and extraordinary learning, so that it became a standard against which other later codifications were often measured.<ref>Isidore Twersky, ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, \"Epilogue,\" pp. 515\u2013538.</ref> It is still closely studied in rabbinic yeshivot (academies). A popular medieval saying that also served as his [[epitaph]] states, ''From [[Moses|Mosheh]] (of the Torah) to Mosheh (Maimonides) there was none like Mosheh.'' It chiefly referred to his rabbinic writings.\n\nBut Maimonides was also one of the most influential figures in medieval Jewish philosophy. His brilliant adaptation of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian thought]] to Biblical faith deeply impressed later Jewish thinkers, and had an unexpected immediate historical impact.<ref>This is covered in all histories of the Jews. E.g., including such a brief overview as Cecil Roth, ''A History of the Jews'', Revised Edition (New York: Schocken, 1970), pp. 175\u2013179.</ref> Some more acculturated Jews in the century that followed his death, particularly in Spain, sought to apply Maimonides's Aristotelianism in ways that undercut traditionalist belief and observance, giving rise to an intellectual controversy in Spanish and southern French Jewish circles.<ref>D.J. Silver, ''Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180\u20131240'' (Leiden: Brill, 1965), is still the most detailed account.</ref> The intensity of debate spurred Catholic Church interventions against \"heresy\" and a general confiscation of rabbinic texts. In reaction, the more radical interpretations of Maimonides were defeated. At least amongst Ashkenazi Jews, there was a tendency to ignore his specifically philosophical writings and to stress instead the rabbinic and halakhic writings. These writings often included considerable philosophical chapters or discussions in support of halakhic observance; David Hartman observes that Maimonides clearly expressed \"the traditional support for a philosophical understanding of God both in the Aggadah of Talmud and in the behavior of the hasid [the pious Jew].\"<ref>David Hartman, ''Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1976), p. 98.</ref> Maimonidean thought continues to influence traditionally observant Jews.<ref>On the extensive philosophical aspects of Maimonides's halakhic works, see in particular Isidore Twersky's ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). Twersky devotes a major portion of this authoritative study to the philosophical aspects of the ''Mishneh Torah'' itself.</ref><ref>The Maimunist or Maimonidean controversy is covered in all histories of Jewish philosophy and general histories of the Jews. For an overview, with bibliographic references, see Idit Dobbs-Weinstein, \"The Maimonidean Controversy,\" in ''History of Jewish Philosophy'', Second Edition, edited by Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 331\u2013349.  Also see Colette Sirat, ''A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 205\u2013272.</ref>\n\nThe most rigorous medieval critique of Maimonides is [[Hasdai Crescas]]'s ''[[Or Adonai]]''. Crescas bucked the eclectic trend, by demolishing the certainty of the Aristotelian world-view, not only in religious matters but also in the most basic areas of medieval science (such as physics and geometry). Crescas's critique provoked a number of 15th-century scholars to write defenses of Maimonides. A partial translation of Crescas was produced by [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1929.\n\nBecause of his path-finding synthesis of Aristotle and Biblical faith, Maimonides had a fundamental influence on the great Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Mercedes Rubio|title=Aquinas and Maimonides on the possibility of the knowledge of god |pages=65\u2013126 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-4747-9_2 |isbn=978-1-4020-4720-6|chapter=Aquinas and Maimonides on the Divine Names }}</ref> Aquinas refers specifically to Maimonides in several of his works, including the ''[[Commentary on the Sentences]]''.\n\nMaimonides's combined abilities in the fields of theology, philosophy and medicine make his work attractive today as a source during discussions of evolving norms in these fields, particularly medicine.

He has been adopted as a symbol and an intellectual hero by almost all major movements in modern Judaism, and has proven important to philosophers such as [[Leo Strauss]]; and his views on the importance of [[humility]] have been taken up by modern [[humanism|humanist]] philosophers.\n\nIn academia, particularly within the area of Jewish Studies, the teaching of Maimonides has been dominated by traditional scholars, generally Orthodox, who place a very strong emphasis on Maimonides as a rationalist; one result is that certain sides of Maimonides's thought, including his opposition to anthropocentrism, have been obviated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} There are movements in some postmodern circles to claim Maimonides for other purposes, as within the discourse of ecotheology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neohasid.org/torah/rambam/|title=Maimonides \u2013 His Thought Related to Ecology in The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature}}</ref> Maimonides's reconciliation of the philosophical and the traditional has given his legacy an extremely diverse and dynamic quality.\n\n==Tributes and memorials==\n[[File:Maimonides, at Rambam Medical Center.jpg|thumb|Plaque of Maimonides at Rambam Medical Center, [[Haifa]]]]\nMaimonides has been memorialized in numerous ways.

In his work devoted to the Treatise, [[R\u00e9mi Brague]] stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein. This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Al-Farabi's works on logic. In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called ''The words of Logic'' which describes the bulk of the work. The author explains the technical meaning of the words used by logicians. The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to. The work proceeds rationally through a lexicon of philosophical terms to a summary of higher philosophical topics, in 14 chapters corresponding to Maimonides's birthdate of 14 Nissan. The number 14 recurs in many of Maimonides's works. Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions. The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples. At the end of each chapter, the author carefully draws up the list of words studied.\n\nUntil very recently, it was accepted that Maimonides wrote the ''Treatise on logic'' in his twenties or even in his teen<ref>Abraham Heschel, ''Maimonides''.
