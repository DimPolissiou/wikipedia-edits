The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The earliest drives were usable only in the protected environment of a [[data center]]. Later generations progressively reached factories, offices and homes, eventually becoming ubiquitous.\n\nDisk media [[wikt:diameter|diameter]] was initially 24 inches in diameter, but over time it has been reduced to today's 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch standard sizes. Drives with the larger 24-inch- and 14-inch-diameter media were typically mounted in standalone boxes (resembling [[washing machine]]s) or large equipment rack enclosures. Individual drives often required high-current [[Alternating current|AC]] power due to the large motors required to spin the large disks. Drives with smaller media generally conformed to de facto standard [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factors]].\n\nThe capacity of hard drives has grown exponentially over time. When hard drives became available for personal computers, they offered 5-[[megabyte]] capacity. During the mid-1990s the typical hard disk drive for a PC had a capacity of about 1 [[gigabyte]].<ref>1996 Disk Trend Report \u2013 Rigid Disk Drives, Figure 2 \u2013 Unit Shipment Summary</ref> As of December 2019, desktop hard disk drives typically had a capacity of 1 to 6 [[terabyte]]s, with the largest-capacity drives reaching 16 terabytes.\n\nUnit production peaked in 2010 at about 650 million units and has been in a slow decline since then.\n\n==1950s\u20131970s==\n{{See also|Early IBM disk storage}}\nThe [[IBM 350]] Disk File was developed under the code-name RAMAC by an IBM San Jose team led by [[Reynold B.

This technology and its derivatives remained the standard through 2011. Project head Kenneth Haughton named it after the [[Winchester 30-30 rifle]] because it was planned to have two 30&nbsp;MB spindles; however, the actual product shipped with two spindles for data modules of either 35&nbsp;MB or 70&nbsp;MB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3340.html|title=IBM Archives: IBM 3340 direct access storage facility|date=23 January 2003|website=www.ibm.com}}</ref> The name 'Winchester' and some derivatives are still common in some non-English speaking countries to generally refer to any hard disks (e.g. [[Hungary]], [[Russia]]).\n\nAlso in 1973, [[Control Data Corporation]] introduced the first of its series of [[Storage Module Device|SMD]] disk drives using conventional disk pack technology. The SMD family became the predominant disk drive in the minicomputer market into the 1980s.\n\nSmaller diameter media came into usage during the 1970s and by the end of the decade standard [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factors]] had been established for drives using nominally 8-inch media (e.g., Shugart SA1000) and nominally 5.25-inch media (e.g., Seagate [[ST-506]]).\n\nDuring the 1970s, captive production, dominated by IBM's production for its own use, remained the largest revenue channel for HDDs, though the relative importance of the [[OEM]] channel grew. Led by [[Control Data Corporation#Magnetic Peripherals Inc.|Control Data]], Diablo Systems, [[Calcomp|CalComp]] and [[Memorex]], the [[OEM]] segment reached $631 million in 1979, but still well below the $2.8 billion associated with captive production.<ref>[http://isic.ucsd.edu/demandbased.html Storage Industry Dynamics And Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209155900/http://isic.ucsd.edu/demandbased.html |date=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n==1980s, the transition to the PC era==\nThe 1980s saw the minicomputer age plateau as PCs were introduced. Manufacturers such as DEC and Hewlett-Packard continued to manufacture minicomputer compatible hard drive systems as industry demanded higher storage. Hewlett-Packard introduced the [[HP 7935]] as one such drive. But it was clear that smaller Winchester storage systems were eclipsing large platter hard drives.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:ST 225 20MB drive and WDC controller.jpg|thumb|Seagate 20 MB HDD and Western Digital Controller for PC]]\nHard disk drives for personal computers (PCs) were initially a rare and very expensive optional feature; systems typically had only the less expensive floppy disk drives or even cassette tape drives as both secondary storage and transport media. However by the late '80s, hard disk drives were standard on all but the cheapest PC and floppy disks were used almost solely as transport media.\n\nMost hard disk drives in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users by [[systems integrator]]s such as the [[Corvus Systems|Corvus Disk System]] or the systems manufacturer such as the [[Apple ProFile]]. The [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM PC XT]] in 1983, included an internal standard 10MB hard disk drive, and soon thereafter internal hard disk drives proliferated on personal computers, one popular type was the [[ST506/ST412]] hard drive and MFM interface.\n\nHDDs continued to get smaller with the introduction of the 3.5-inch [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factor]] in the middle of the decade [[Rodime|Rodime 1983]] and the 2.5-inch form factor [[PrairieTek|PrairieTek 1988]].\n\nIndustry participation peaked with about 75 active manufacturers in 1985 and then declined thereafter even though volume continued to climb: by 1989 reaching 22 million units and $23 billion in revenue.<ref>Disk/Trend Report - Rigid Disk Drives, October 1989</ref>\n\n==1990s==\nEven though there were a number of new entrants, industry participants continued to decline in total to 15 in 1999.

The earliest drives were usable only in the protected environment of a [[data center]]. Later generations progressively reached factories, offices and homes, eventually becoming ubiquitous.\n\nDisk media [[wikt:diameter|diameter]] was initially 24 inches in diameter, but over time it has been reduced to today's 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch standard sizes. Drives with the larger 24-inch- and 14-inch-diameter media were typically mounted in standalone boxes (resembling [[washing machine]]s) or large equipment rack enclosures. Individual drives often required high-current [[Alternating current|AC]] power due to the large motors required to spin the large disks. Drives with smaller media generally conformed to de facto standard [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factors]].\n\nThe capacity of hard drives has grown exponentially over time. When hard drives became available for personal computers, they offered 5-[[megabyte]] capacity. During the mid-1990s the typical hard disk drive for a PC had a capacity of about 1 [[gigabyte]].<ref>1996 Disk Trend Report \u2013 Rigid Disk Drives, Figure 2 \u2013 Unit Shipment Summary</ref> As of December 2019, desktop hard disk drives typically had a capacity of 1 to 6 [[terabyte]]s, with the largest-capacity drives reaching 16 terabytes.\n\nUnit production peaked in 2010 at about 650 million units and has been in a slow decline since then.\n\n==1950s\u20131970s==\n{{See also|Early IBM disk storage}}\nThe [[IBM 350]] Disk File was developed under the code-name RAMAC by an IBM San Jose team led by [[Reynold B.

Project head Kenneth Haughton named it after the [[Winchester 30-30 rifle]] because it was planned to have two 30&nbsp;MB spindles; however, the actual product shipped with two spindles for data modules of either 35&nbsp;MB or 70&nbsp;MB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3340.html|title=IBM Archives: IBM 3340 direct access storage facility|date=23 January 2003|website=www.ibm.com}}</ref> The name 'Winchester' and some derivatives are still common in some non-English speaking countries to generally refer to any hard disks (e.g. [[Hungary]], [[Russia]]).\n\nAlso in 1973, [[Control Data Corporation]] introduced the first of its series of [[Storage Module Device|SMD]] disk drives using conventional disk pack technology. The SMD family became the predominant disk drive in the minicomputer market into the 1980s.\n\nSmaller diameter media came into usage during the 1970s and by the end of the decade standard [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factors]] had been established for drives using nominally 8-inch media (e.g., Shugart SA1000) and nominally 5.25-inch media (e.g., Seagate [[ST-506]]).\n\nDuring the 1970s, captive production, dominated by IBM's production for its own use, remained the largest revenue channel for HDDs, though the relative importance of the [[OEM]] channel grew. Led by [[Control Data Corporation#Magnetic Peripherals Inc.|Control Data]], Diablo Systems, [[Calcomp|CalComp]] and [[Memorex]], the [[OEM]] segment reached $631 million in 1979, but still well below the $2.8 billion associated with captive production.<ref>[http://isic.ucsd.edu/demandbased.html Storage Industry Dynamics And Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209155900/http://isic.ucsd.edu/demandbased.html |date=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n==1980s, the transition to the PC era==\nThe 1980s saw the minicomputer age plateau as PCs were introduced. Manufacturers such as DEC and Hewlett-Packard continued to manufacture minicomputer compatible hard drive systems as industry demanded higher storage. Hewlett-Packard introduced the [[HP 7935]] as one such drive. But it was clear that smaller Winchester storage systems were eclipsing large platter hard drives.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:ST 225 20MB drive and WDC controller.jpg|thumb|Seagate 20 MB HDD and Western Digital Controller for PC]]\nHard disk drives for personal computers (PCs) were initially a rare and very expensive optional feature; systems typically had only the less expensive floppy disk drives or even cassette tape drives as both secondary storage and transport media. However by the late '80s, hard disk drives were standard on all but the cheapest PC and floppy disks were used almost solely as transport media.\n\nMost hard disk drives in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users by [[systems integrator]]s such as the [[Corvus Systems|Corvus Disk System]] or the systems manufacturer such as the [[Apple ProFile]]. The [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM PC XT]] in 1983, included an internal standard 10MB hard disk drive, and soon thereafter internal hard disk drives proliferated on personal computers, one popular type was the [[ST506/ST412]] hard drive and MFM interface.\n\nHDDs continued to get smaller with the introduction of the 3.5-inch [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factor]] in the middle of the decade [[Rodime|Rodime 1983]] and the 2.5-inch form factor [[PrairieTek|PrairieTek 1988]].\n\nIndustry participation peaked with about 75 active manufacturers in 1985 and then declined thereafter even though volume continued to climb: by 1989 reaching 22 million units and $23 billion in revenue.<ref>Disk/Trend Report - Rigid Disk Drives, October 1989</ref>\n\n==1990s==\nEven though there were a number of new entrants, industry participants continued to decline in total to 15 in 1999. Unit volume and industry revenue monotonically increased during the 1990s to 174 million units and $26 billion.<ref>Gartner/Dataquest, Market Share and Forecast: Hard Disk Drives, Worldwide, 2001-2010, Chapter 2, (c) 2006</ref>\n\nThe industry production consolidated around the 3.5-inch and 2.5 inch form factors; the larger form factors dying off while several smaller form factors were offered but achieved limited success, e.g. [[HP Kittyhawk microdrive|HP 1.3-inch Kittyhawk]], [[Microdrive|IBM 1-inch Microdrive]], etc..\n\n==2000 to present==\n[[File:Hard disk WD20EARS IMGP0964 wp.jpg|thumb|A 2TB Hard drive from 2011 with built in SATA interface]]\nIn 2001 the HDD industry experienced its first ever decline in units and revenue.\n\nThe number of industry participants decreased to 6 in 2009 and 3 in 2013.\n\nUnit production peaked in 2010 at about 650 million units.

It is located at [[McCan Barracks]], [[Templemore]], [[County Tipperary]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The college has been in Templemore since 1964.\n\n==History==\nThe training role was previously undertaken at Garda Headquarters (in the [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin). When in February 1964 training moved to McCan Barracks, it became known as the ''Garda Training Centre'', or locally as ''the depot''.\nIn 1992 the Garda College was designated an Institute of Higher Education by the National Council for Education Awards ([[National Council for Educational Awards|NCEA]]).<ref>[http://www.borrisoleigh.ie/tourism/sites-of-interest/ Sites of Interest]</ref> More recently the BA in Applied Policing is awarded by the [[University of Limerick]].<ref>[http://www.ul.ie/news-centre/news/ul-to-accredit-ba-in-applied-policing-for-an-garda-siochana UL to accredit BA in Applied Policing for An Garda Siochana] News University of Limerick, 30 March 2015.</ref>\n\n==Courses offered==\nTwo courses are available, both conferred by the ''[[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]]'':\n\n:* '''Bachelor of Arts (in Police Studies)''': for fresh recruits. The entry requirements are mainly [[ageing|age]], [[moral character|character]], [[citizenship]], education and health based, competitions for entry are advertised periodically, usually annually.\n\n:* '''Bachelor of Arts (in Police Management)''': for senior officers. The entry requirement is to be a senior manager at superintendent or officer grade. The course's main function is to serve those members with additional skills and training. This is currently being carried out in a hotel in [[Nenagh]], [[County Tipperary]] due to more space being needed for the training of new recruits.\n\nCandidates with other qualifications, particularly technical, may be considered for specific positions where a technical skill set is a prerequisite. This is usually for computer, finance and fraud based branches and investigations.\n\nVarious other specialist courses are available for serving force members.\n\n==Training programme==\n[[File:Garda 08.png|thumb|150px|Student Garda epaulette]]\nThe training programme for Recruit Garda\u00ed remained similar to that conducted in the Phoenix Park, which provided for 18 weeks training before being allocated to a Garda Station.\n\nAfter one year \"on the job\" each Recruit Garda returned to Templemore for a one-month \"refresher course\". The training was extended to 22 weeks in the late 1970s. The subjects studied were Police Duties, Irish, and Physical Studies, consisting of Physical Training, Drill, Swimming, and First Aid.\n\nFollowing a major examination of all training in the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na a new two-year Student/Probationer Education/Training Programme was introduced for trainee Garda\u00ed in April 1989. A major building programme saw the facilities developed and modernised to the most up to date standards in Europe and the name of the institution changed from the Garda Training Centre to the Garda College.\n\nIn 1992 the Garda College was designated by the Minister for Education as an institution which the [[National Council for Educational Awards]] (NCEA) could accredit. The following year, the two-year Student/Probationer Education/Training Programme was accredited by the NCEA with the award of a National Diploma in Police Studies. A more recent initiative saw the development of a Bachelor of Arts (Police Management) degree for Garda Officers of Superintendent rank upwards.\n\n==College Facilities==\nFollowing a major building programme in 2001, the College has the capacity to accommodate 520 persons. The College has expanded its education facilities and included in the new development are three Lecture Theatres.\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:LectureCollege.jpg|thumb|Garda College]] -->\nThe Garda College has its own nine (9) hole golf course with a Clubhouse and leisure facility. It also has three tennis courts \u2013 designed and floodlit to meet international championship standards. In addition the sportsfield complex comprises full size [[Gaelic games]], soccer and rugby pitches as well as a modern pavilion with Changing Rooms, First Aid room, Weights Room and facilities for officials.\n\nCampus facilities include a Social Club, Indoor Sports Hall with two Squash Courts and separate handball alley, a 25-metre swimming pool, fully equipped gymnasium with accompanying leisure facilities.\n\nThe Education Block is purpose built to provide for the education/training requirements of a modern police service. In addition to the technological facilities available, there is also a 'Scenes of Crime Room', a 'Mock' Garda Station, Courtroom, Language Laboratory, classroom facilities and a Library containing over 12,000 books.\n\n==Awards==\nProbationer Garda\u00ed are recognised for effort and endeavour throughout the two-year programme and on graduation day the following medals are awarded:\n\n:'''The Gary Sheehan Memorial Medal'''\n\n:The Gary Sheehan Memorial Medal commemorates Recruit Garda [[Gary Sheehan (police officer)|Gary Sheehan]], killed on duty at Ballinamore, Co Leitrim on 16 December 1983, and is awarded to the best all-round probationer. The recipient will have contributed significantly to life at the Garda College, distinguished himself/herself in the academic field and will have made a significant contribution to the stations and communities in which he/she served. Additionally, the winner will have, by the initiative shown, and leadership qualities so obviously displayed during the training period, won the respect of his/her peers and authorities.\n\n:'''The Commissioner's Medal'''\n\n:The Commissioner's Medal is awarded to the Student achieving the highest aggregate marks in academic subjects over Phase I, III and V Education/Training.

It is located at [[McCan Barracks]], [[Templemore]], [[County Tipperary]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The college has been in Templemore since 1964.\n\n==History==\nThe training role was previously undertaken at Garda Headquarters (in the [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin). When in February 1964 training moved to McCan Barracks, it became known as the ''Garda Training Centre'', or locally as ''the depot''.\nIn 1992 the Garda College was designated an Institute of Higher Education by the National Council for Education Awards ([[National Council for Educational Awards|NCEA]]).<ref>[http://www.borrisoleigh.ie/tourism/sites-of-interest/ Sites of Interest]</ref> More recently the BA in Applied Policing is awarded by the [[University of Limerick]].<ref>[http://www.ul.ie/news-centre/news/ul-to-accredit-ba-in-applied-policing-for-an-garda-siochana UL to accredit BA in Applied Policing for An Garda Siochana] News University of Limerick, 30 March 2015.</ref>\n\n==Courses offered==\nTwo courses are available, both conferred by the ''[[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]]'':\n\n:* '''Bachelor of Arts (in Police Studies)''': for fresh recruits. The entry requirements are mainly [[ageing|age]], [[moral character|character]], [[citizenship]], education and health based, competitions for entry are advertised periodically, usually annually.\n\n:* '''Bachelor of Arts (in Police Management)''': for senior officers. The entry requirement is to be a senior manager at superintendent or officer grade. The course's main function is to serve those members with additional skills and training. This is currently being carried out in a hotel in [[Nenagh]], [[County Tipperary]] due to more space being needed for the training of new recruits.\n\nCandidates with other qualifications, particularly technical, may be considered for specific positions where a technical skill set is a prerequisite. This is usually for computer, finance and fraud based branches and investigations.\n\nVarious other specialist courses are available for serving force members.\n\n==Training programme==\n[[File:Garda 08.png|thumb|150px|Student Garda epaulette]]\nThe training programme for Recruit Garda\u00ed remained similar to that conducted in the Phoenix Park, which provided for 18 weeks training before being allocated to a Garda Station.\n\nAfter one year \"on the job\" each Recruit Garda returned to Templemore for a one-month \"refresher course\". The training was extended to 22 weeks in the late 1970s. The subjects studied were Police Duties, Irish, and Physical Studies, consisting of Physical Training, Drill, Swimming, and First Aid.\n\nFollowing a major examination of all training in the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na a new two-year Student/Probationer Education/Training Programme was introduced for trainee Garda\u00ed in April 1989. A major building programme saw the facilities developed and modernised to the most up to date standards in Europe and the name of the institution changed from the Garda Training Centre to the Garda College.\n\nIn 1992 the Garda College was designated by the Minister for Education as an institution which the [[National Council for Educational Awards]] (NCEA) could accredit. The following year, the two-year Student/Probationer Education/Training Programme was accredited by the NCEA with the award of a National Diploma in Police Studies. A more recent initiative saw the development of a Bachelor of Arts (Police Management) degree for Garda Officers of Superintendent rank upwards.\n\n==College Facilities==\nFollowing a major building programme in 2001, the College has the capacity to accommodate 520 persons. The College has expanded its education facilities and included in the new development are three Lecture Theatres.\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:LectureCollege.jpg|thumb|Garda College]] -->\nThe Garda College has its own nine (9) hole golf course with a Clubhouse and leisure facility. It also has three tennis courts \u2013 designed and floodlit to meet international championship standards. In addition the sportsfield complex comprises full size [[Gaelic games]], soccer and rugby pitches as well as a modern pavilion with Changing Rooms, First Aid room, Weights Room and facilities for officials.\n\nCampus facilities include a Social Club, Indoor Sports Hall with two Squash Courts and separate handball alley, a 25-metre swimming pool, fully equipped gymnasium with accompanying leisure facilities.\n\nThe Education Block is purpose built to provide for the education/training requirements of a modern police service. In addition to the technological facilities available, there is also a 'Scenes of Crime Room', a 'Mock' Garda Station, Courtroom, Language Laboratory, classroom facilities and a Library containing over 12,000 books.\n\n==Awards==\nProbationer Garda\u00ed are recognised for effort and endeavour throughout the two-year programme and on graduation day the following medals are awarded:\n\n:'''The Gary Sheehan Memorial Medal'''\n\n:The Gary Sheehan Memorial Medal commemorates Recruit Garda [[Gary Sheehan (police officer)|Gary Sheehan]], killed on duty at Ballinamore, Co Leitrim on 16 December 1983, and is awarded to the best all-round probationer. The recipient will have contributed significantly to life at the Garda College, distinguished himself/herself in the academic field and will have made a significant contribution to the stations and communities in which he/she served. Additionally, the winner will have, by the initiative shown, and leadership qualities so obviously displayed during the training period, won the respect of his/her peers and authorities.\n\n:'''The Commissioner's Medal'''\n\n:The Commissioner's Medal is awarded to the Student achieving the highest aggregate marks in academic subjects over Phase I, III and V Education/Training. The winner will have excelled in Legal, Policing and Technical Studies, the Social Sciences, Communications, Physical Education Studies, Gaeilge and Dissertation.\n\n:'''The Templemore Town Council Medal'''\n\n:The Templemore Town Council Medal is awarded to the student who throughout the Student/Probationer Education/Training Course has demonstrated insight and imagination in his/her approach to the Social Science Studies Course and has displayed, through innovative and practical involvement in the social affairs of the communities, within which he/she serves, an appreciation of the key social role of the Garda\u00ed at local and/or national level. The winner will also have distinguished himself/herself academically in the Social Science Studies course.\n\n==Entry==\nThe recruitment process is by means of a competition where the highest ranked applicants progress to the next stage.
