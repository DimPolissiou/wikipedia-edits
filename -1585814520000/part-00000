As of 2008 it is unclear if ''I. melanochlorus'' also occurs on the Pacific slopes of Costa Rica, or if those are misidentified ''I. aucoinae''.<ref name=IUCN/> McDiarmid and Savage recorded it in 2005 in meadows of the [[Peninsula de Osa]], extending the distribution to the Pacific slopes in the far southwest of the country.<ref name=STRI/><ref name=AmphiWeb/> According to Pounds ''et al''. in 1997, it disappeared from [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve|Monteverde]], Costa Rica, in the late 1980s and then reappeared there in the 1990s.<ref name=IUCN/> \n\nIn 2004 the toad was recorded in Nicaragua for first time (correctly) in the [[Indio Ma\u00edz Biological Reserve]] by [[Gunther K\u00f6hler]] and his team,<ref name=IUCN/> in 2009 it was also recorded from [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|R\u00edo San Juan]] under auspices of an expedition by K\u00f6hler<ref name=STRI/> and in 2014 it was reported in [[Rivas Department]] on the Pacific coast by a Nicaraguan team.<ref name=frost/> In 2009 the distribution was extended to Panama following Jaramillo and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez (2009).<ref name=frost/>\n\n==Ecology==\nThis toad is [[nocturnal]] and [[insectivorous]].<ref name=AmphiWeb/> The toads may become more active during light rain showers.<ref name=Taylor1952/>\n\n===Habitat===\nThe native [[habitat]]s of this species are wet lowland [[rainforest]]s and the lower [[montane forest|premontane wet forests]] at elevations to about {{convert|1080|m|abbr=on}} [[Above sea level|asl]].<ref name=IUCN/> Its favourite locations are near large streams and at the edges of forests.<ref name=AmphiWeb/> In the northeastern rainforests of Costa Rica it occurs from [[Above sea level|sea level]] to {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} in elevation, with frogs of the genus ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'' being the few amphibians to occur at higher altitudes here.<ref name=CCT.Ramsar#2/> It is occasionally found amongst the leaf litter on the forest floor.<ref name=AmphiWeb/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nReproduction happens during the dry season<ref name=STRI/><ref name=AmphiWeb/> starting with the males calling from January to February from pools along rocky streams, or within {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} of water. Males may call at odd times of the year. Males develop dark-brown [[nuptial pads]] on their first and second fingers during breeding season.<ref name=AmphiWeb/> Although some sources claim breeding ([[amplexus]]) takes place in large streams,<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=STRI/> according to Savage (2002) it occurs in small, somewhat rocky-bottomed streams which are at low water for the season.<ref name=AmphiWeb/>\n\n===Interspecific relationships===\nMale toads may share their pools with the larger ''[[Bufo marinus]]'' toads.<ref name=AmphiWeb/>\n\n===Diseases===\nThe pathogenic fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has had no impact on this toad.<ref name=IUCN/>\n\n==Conservation==\nWhen the species had been less studied, earlier authors such as Bola\u00f1os & Chaves writing for the IUCN in 2004 mistakenly believed it to be [[endemism|endemic]] to Costa Rica.<ref name=IUCNorig/><ref name=CCT.Ramsar#2/> As such it was automatically added to the [[Regional Red List|local Red List]] and considered [[Threatened species|threatened]]. It was described in 2004 as most likely not very tolerant of [[deforestation]] and [[siltation]] and pollution of its breeding habitat, but nonetheless it was downgraded to \"least concern\" in 2004.<ref name=IUCNorig/> As of 2008 the IUCN describes it as \"widespread and regularly encountered\" and \"common and somewhat adaptable with a presumed large population\". It is regularly seen during the breeding period,<ref name=IUCN/> and is common in wet forests at higher elevations at favoured habitats.<ref name=AmphiWeb/> It occurs at [[La Selva Biological Station]], in the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] (if correctly identified)<ref name=IUCN/> and throughout the [[Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge]] in Costa Rica,<ref name=CCT.Ramsar#2/> and in the [[Indio Ma\u00edz Biological Reserve]]<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=STRI/> and [[R\u00edo San Juan Wildlife Refuge]] in Nicaragua.<ref name=STRI/> It is kept in an ''[[ex situ]]'' collection at the [[Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center]].<ref name=Paull/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q28031712}}\n\n[[Category:Incilius|melanochlorus]]\n[[Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Amphibians of Panama]]\n[[Category:Amphibians described in 1877]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incilius_melanochlorus"}

Since the age of 18 she has lived just outside Manchester's city centre. Her early lo-fi home recordings were released on CDR and 7-inch via small local label Filthy Home Recordings.\n\nShe came to the attention of Warp, signing with them in 2009. ''[[Nerve Up]]'' (2010) was recorded in a crumbling room of a mill in [[Miles Platting]], a run-down area of East Manchester, co-produced by Campbell and Guy Fixsen (Laika, My Bloody Valentine). The room was purpose built using breeze-blocks and salvaged scrap. Campbell's love of raw industrial spaces has been present from day one, infiltrating into her psyche and her music, and this has also meant a tendency to avoid professional recording studios.<ref name=popmatters_mankowski>{{cite web|last1=Mankowski|first1=Guy|authorlink1=Guy Mankowski|title=An Artist Living in an Edgeland: An Interview With LoneLady|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/192821-an-artist-living-in-an-edgeland-an-interview-with-lonelady/|website=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor her live shows, Campbell arranges parts and shows her musicians what to play. Campbell toured ''Nerve Up'' in the UK and Europe, which included a support tour with art-pop pioneers [[Wire (band)|Wire]]. After touring Campbell contributed vocals and guitar to various other projects. Due to these projects and fluctuating management, it would be 2015 before Campbell's second album ''[[Hinterland (Lonelady album)|Hinterland]]'' appeared, a delay that Campbell is unhappy about.\n\n''Hinterland'' (Warp, 2015) is driven by Campbell's increasing interest in [[psychogeography]]<ref name=guardian_ruins>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Julie|title=LoneLady: Ruins are my idea of fun|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/06/lonelady-ruins-are-my-idea-of-fun|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=6 July 2015}}</ref> and [[Brutalist architecture]]. \"It seems like these places reflect a part of me; that I belong there..there\u2019s a communication...walking in these places feels a little bit ritualistic. Its about what surrounds you every day, transforming the unremarkable and derelict into something that has magic and meaning.\" Landscapes obsess ''Hinterland'' - the word itself translates as \"the land behind\" or \"unknown region\" - every song is about a landscape of one kind or another; Mancunian wildernesses, childhood playspaces, the landscape of the mind.\n\nThe 6-minute-long dance-influenced \"Groove It Out\" was released on 12-inch and download November 2014 and featured a remix by Ekoplekz. The second single \"Bunkerpop\" was released in February 2015 on 12-inch and download and featured a remix by Wrangler.\n\nCampbell's second album ''Hinterland'' was released in 2015. More rhythm-oriented, the songs are longer, with simple drum machine at its core, setting up the groove. Embellished with Campbell's intricate and propulsive guitar playing and various instruments including electronic drums, cello and clavinet, ''Hinterland'' expands Campbell's previously stark approach into more colourful dimensions, and shows funk and dance influences coming to the fore. Campbell plays all instruments except real drums and she recorded, mixed and produced ''Hinterland'' to near-completion in Concrete Retreat, her home studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/features/interviews/interview-lonelady/|title=M Magazine Interview:LoneLady}}</ref>\n\n\"I recorded and mixed the songs in my home studio using a Tascam 8-track cassette recorder and Garageband.

She first started making music on a 4-track cassette recorder in her towerblock flat in Manchester while completing a Fine Art degree.

This would later evolve to a 4-piece band live.\n\nCampbell came to the attention of [[Warp (record label)|Warp]] signing with them in 2009, and her first album ''[[Nerve Up]]'' was released in 2010 to widespread critical acclaim.

Since the age of 18 she has lived just outside Manchester's city centre. Her early lo-fi home recordings were released on CDR and 7-inch via small local label Filthy Home Recordings.\n\nShe came to the attention of Warp, signing with them in 2009. ''[[Nerve Up]]'' (2010) was recorded in a crumbling room of a mill in [[Miles Platting]], a run-down area of East Manchester, co-produced by Campbell and [[Guy Fixsen]] (Laika, My Bloody Valentine). The room was purpose built using breeze-blocks and salvaged scrap. Campbell's love of raw industrial spaces has been present from day one, infiltrating into her psyche and her music, and this has also meant a tendency to avoid professional recording studios.<ref name=popmatters_mankowski>{{cite web|last1=Mankowski|first1=Guy|authorlink1=Guy Mankowski|title=An Artist Living in an Edgeland: An Interview With LoneLady|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/192821-an-artist-living-in-an-edgeland-an-interview-with-lonelady/|website=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor her live shows, Campbell arranges parts and shows her musicians what to play. Campbell toured ''Nerve Up'' in the UK and Europe, which included a support tour with art-pop pioneers [[Wire (band)|Wire]]. After touring Campbell contributed vocals and guitar to various other projects. Due to these projects and fluctuating management, it would be 2015 before Campbell's second album ''[[Hinterland (Lonelady album)|Hinterland]]'' appeared, a delay that Campbell is unhappy about.\n\n''Hinterland'' (Warp, 2015) is driven by Campbell's increasing interest in [[psychogeography]]<ref name=guardian_ruins>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Julie|title=LoneLady: Ruins are my idea of fun|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/06/lonelady-ruins-are-my-idea-of-fun|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=6 July 2015}}</ref> and [[Brutalist architecture]]. \"It seems like these places reflect a part of me; that I belong there..there\u2019s a communication...walking in these places feels a little bit ritualistic. Its about what surrounds you every day, transforming the unremarkable and derelict into something that has magic and meaning.\" Landscapes obsess ''Hinterland'' - the word itself translates as \"the land behind\" or \"unknown region\" - every song is about a landscape of one kind or another; Mancunian wildernesses, childhood playspaces, the landscape of the mind.\n\nThe 6-minute-long dance-influenced \"Groove It Out\" was released on 12-inch and download November 2014 and featured a remix by Ekoplekz. The second single \"Bunkerpop\" was released in February 2015 on 12-inch and download and featured a remix by Wrangler.\n\nCampbell's second album ''Hinterland'' was released in 2015. More rhythm-oriented, the songs are longer, with simple drum machine at its core, setting up the groove. Embellished with Campbell's intricate and propulsive guitar playing and various instruments including electronic drums, cello and clavinet, ''Hinterland'' expands Campbell's previously stark approach into more colourful dimensions, and shows funk and dance influences coming to the fore. Campbell plays all instruments except real drums and she recorded, mixed and produced ''Hinterland'' to near-completion in Concrete Retreat, her home studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/features/interviews/interview-lonelady/|title=M Magazine Interview:LoneLady}}</ref>\n\n\"I recorded and mixed the songs in my home studio using a Tascam 8-track cassette recorder and Garageband.
