The first thing the app displays is who the character's parents are, and their occupation, as well as your birthday, [[star sign]], how you were conceived and if you have any siblings or pets. In some cases, your character may have been put up for adoption at birth. To add one year to your character's life, you press the \"Age\" button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/bitlife-life-simulator|title=BitLife - Life Simulator - App Review|date=2018-12-14|website=Common Sense Media|language=en|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Stages of a life ===\n==== Childhood ====\nBetween ages 0 and 5, you are considered an \"infant.\" Between ages 5 and 8, depending on the country you are playing in, you begin elementary or [[primary school]]. You then advance to the next level of schooling between ages 11 and 14, either \"[[middle school]]\" or \"[[secondary school]]\" depending on the country, and then (in some countries) to a final level of basic schooling by age 16. In middle school or secondary school, the option to join a school club becomes available, as well as the option to join a clique. All-female characters will also have their [[menarche]] randomly between ages 10 and 15. At age 10, it becomes possible to find a date or be asked out on one. Upon reaching age 12, activities to raise the character's four bars (happiness, health, smarts, and looks) start becoming available. Then by age 14, the option to get part-time or freelance jobs becomes available.\n\nDuring childhood, you are largely limited in activities to do. You may be able to ask your parents for money, depending on how generous or rich your parents are as shown by their \"generosity\" or \"money\" bar. Various pop-up scenarios may also appear depending on what age you are at. In your \"infancy\" for example, you may encounter scenarios involving your first words or being taken to get [[vaccine|vaccinated]]. Once you reach school age, scenarios involving activities with friends, your \"first kiss,\" school dances, or other events may appear.\n\n==== Adulthood ====\nBetween ages 15 and 19, depending on the country, you can take your [[driving test]], which is simply a test asking what a road sign means, contrary to real life. If you pass, you may receive a car from your parents depending on their generosity. After you graduate from secondary school, you can decide whether to continue your education, take time off, acquire a full-time occupation, or enlist in the military.\n\nAt age 18, the option to buy a house becomes available, as do all remaining activities such as clubbing, vacationing, [[emigration]], various crime options such as [[burglary]], and gambling. As you age through adulthood, random pop up scenarios will appear as you age requiring decisions that can have major effects on your life. Such scenarios generally involve your career, your health, your spouse and/or children (if you have any), your friends, as well as potential random encounters such as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] person asking for money, being a witness to a crime, having to decide whether to risk your life to save another, among others.\n\nAfter working for a certain number of years, the option to retire becomes available (the exact age of which varies by country). Many occupations will force you into [[retirement]] after a certain point, though in most full-time occupations you will receive a [[pension]] after retiring.\n\n==== Death ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife app death and gravestone.jpg|thumb|right|A gravestone with a ribbon on its upper left corner in BitLife]] -->\nIf you live your life without many harming consequences, you will die of natural causes. Generally, if you keep your health bar close to or at 100%, you will most likely live beyond [[Centenarian|100 years]], contrary to real life where few people live for that long. At the end of each life you are assigned a ribbon, based on how you lived your life. For example, \"Fertile\" ribbons are assigned for having lots of children. Some ribbons are easy to get while others are far more difficult to obtain. Currently, there are a total of 30 ribbons.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-ribbons-list-guide/|title=BitLife Ribbons List Guide|date=2019-06-13|website=progameguides.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> All previous lives you lived are viewable via a \"[[cemetery]]\". Many players believe that 124 is the maximum age in Bitlife, but it is possible to live much longer.\n\nAfter you die, you have the option of starting a new life (either customized or random), replaying the same character again with the option to make different choices, or continuing a \"legacy\" as your character's child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/03/27/bitlife-fame-live-on-as-your-child-and-everything-else-to-expect/|title=BitLife Update|date=2019-03-27|website=gamebozo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Character stats ===\nAt the bottom of the screen when playing are four bars showing the happiness, health, smarts, and looks of one's character between 0 and 100%. Each bar will randomly fluctuate each time the \"age\" button is pressed. Various activities can be performed to either raise or lower each of the bars, such as going to the gym to raise looks. The levels of a player's bars have major impacts on the lives of their characters. High smarts can allow one's character to receive a [[scholarship]] to university for example, while by contrast, low smarts can result in one's application to university being rejected altogether.\n\nCertain occupations in the game (such as an acting job) can make one become \"famous,\" at which point a fifth bar showing your level of \"fame\" is shown. If you fail to keep the fame bar above 0%, then the bar disappears and you are no longer \"famous.\" There is also another major bar concerning the character's \"[[karma]],\" which fluctuates depending on the nature of actions you take for good or bad. While the bar is never seen as one of the main bars at the bottom of the screen during gameplay, it can still have an effect on your character's life, and it is shown on your character's gravestone after death.\n\n=== Relationships ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife App relationships tab.jpeg|thumb|left|An example of the relationships tab in BitLife, showing a character's wife and siblings]] -->\nA core component of the game is \"relationships\" with [[NPCs]]. These include your parents, siblings, nieces/nephews, children, grandchildren, lovers, and friends you make. With every one of these characters, your character has a \"relationship bar\" that fluctuates randomly as you \"age\" and can be raised (or lowered) by interacting with them. If a relationship bar drops too low, then the family member or friend in question may refuse to interact with you.\n\nYour most important relationship is the one with your lover, with whom you may get married and/or have children. You may encounter potential lovers randomly as you play, in the \"love\" tab, at school, or in your workplace. In some cases, your parents may arrange for you to be married, especially if they have a high \"religiousness\" stat bar. After you date a lover for the first time, even if you break things off with them they will remain in your character's \"ex\" tab, allowing for the ability to get back together.\n\nAny [[pet]]s you have also have a relationship bar with you and are listed alongside other family members and friends of yours with unique interactions, tailored specifically to the type of animal the pet is.\n\n=== Occupations ===\nThere are several types of job occupations that a player may take up within the game. Most full-time jobs require a certain level of education, with some requiring you to attend a specialized school, such as a veterinary school for a [[veterinarian]] occupation. Other jobs may simply require a certain character stat to be at a high level, such as high looks to be a [[Model (person)|model]]. All full-time jobs also require an \"interview\" before you are hired, which is simply a random question you must answer. Alongside full-time jobs, there are also [[Part-time contract|part-time]] jobs which a player may take up alongside a full-time occupation such as school, as well as \"[[freelancer|freelance]]\" jobs that can be taken up at random for quick cash, like [[babysitting]] and [[lawn mowing]].\n\nEach job comes with a certain number of \"hours\" of work. The hours your character works can vary widely, depending on the country and whether the job is full or part-time. In total, it is possible to have a \"schedule\" of up to 70 hours a week in the game, though a high number of hours puts the player's character at risk of contracting [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and ultimately a [[heart attack]].\n\n=== Countries ===\n[[File: Countries in BitLife detailed.png|thumb|right|A world map showing all the playable countries in BitLife]]\nThe game has dozens of different countries for a player to play a life in. Depending on the country, certain activities such as gambling, same-sex marriage, or abortion may be legal or illegal. Cost of living, incomes, and life expectancy vary by country as well, as do tax rates, with some countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] having no taxes at all in-game. Playing in certain countries such as [[Afghanistan]] is also made more dangerous by a small chance that each time you hit the \"age\" button, you can be randomly killed in a sort of \"terrorist\" attack. Another notable difference is that when playing in [[South America]]n countries, llamas will replace horses in the pet store.\n\n[[Puerto Rico]], despite being a territory of the [[United States]], stands as its own independent \"country\" in the game due to differences in common names.\n\nEvery country also comes with a handful of cities one can select to play in, such as [[Warsaw, Poland]]. In two cities ([[Miami]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the United States) in the game, which in real life are host to the headquarters of BitLife's developers, it is possible for your character to get a job working for Candywriter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/01/10/bitlife-life-simulator-how-to-get-the-teammate-ribbon/|title=BitLife Life Simulator: How to Get the Teammate Ribbon|date=2019-01-10|website=Gamebozo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Minigames ===\nWithin the game, there are various [[minigames]] you may encounter when performing certain actions. In the casino, for example, there is a [[blackjack]] minigame you can bet money on. Another example involves the option to solve a puzzle that involves maneuvering around a guard to escape from prison, which changes in difficulty depending upon the security level of the prison the player's character is in. There is also a minigame based on [[Snake (video game genre)|the 1978 game Snake]] which one may play while in prison to start a [[Prison riot|riot]]. When serving in the military, you can occasionally be sent to a random country on \"deployment,\" in which case you must solve a [[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]-type minigame (regardless of the branch) without detonating a [[land mine]].\n\n=== Heirlooms ===\nSince August 2019, the game has featured collectible \"[[heirloom]]\" items, with the ability for a player to collect a new one once per day. Upon receiving an heirloom, it appears alongside a character's \"assets,\" and you may have the options to refurbish it, play with it, sell or donate it. If you continue as a character's child after death, the heirloom is passed down to the child. Over time as you \"age,\" the value of the heirloom will rise exponentially. A list of all heirlooms the player has collected is found in the main menu. It is possible to collect the same heirloom more than once.\n\nCertain heirlooms are rarer than others, with the rarest ones being called \"super rare.\" Notable rare heirlooms include the [[Holy Grail]], a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] gas pump, and [[Donald Trump]]'s golden toilet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-heirlooms-list-guide/|title=BitLife Heirlooms List Guide|date=2019-08-22|website=progameguides.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Generally the rarer an heirloom is, the more monetary value it has, though this is not always the case.\n\n=== Temporary features ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BitLife Santa job occupation.jpg|thumb|left|A \"Santa Claus\" job occupation available during the Christmas season in BitLife]] -->\nThe game has periodically included various temporary features in recognition of certain events. On certain holidays for example, the game has made available temporary job occupations, such as an \"[[elf]]\" occupation in recognition of [[Christmas]],<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eexhtp/so_this_is_bitlife/|title=So this is BitLife...|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> a \"pilgrim\" occupation in recognition of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] where you were employed by the [[Plymouth Colony]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/e30vfh/you_can_be_a_pilgrim_now_screenshot_taken/|title=You can be a pilgrim now!|date=2019-11-28|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> and a \"[[leprechaun]]\" occupation in recognition of [[St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1107672493605699587?s=20|title=Who was feeling lucky yesterday?|date=2019-03-18|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Besides temporary job occupations, the game has also seen the addition of other features for holidays such as various pop-up scenarios, one notable example being the ability to attempt to \"kiss\" your cousin under the [[mistletoe]], which was added during the 2019 Christmas season and required you to hit a confirm button multiple times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eetf8u/so_i_wanted_to_see_what_would_happen_if_i_kissed/|title=So I wanted to see what would happen if I kissed my cousin and it literally asked me 10 times if I was sure|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nAlongside temporary holiday-themed features, since July 2019, the game has also featured pop up scenarios relating to \"current\" events. Notable ones have included an option for your character to pick a side in the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1147963494886567936?s=20|title=Congratulations #USWNT|date=2019-07-07|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> and an option to decide whether or not to join in on the Facebook event to [[Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us|storm Area 51]].\n\n=== Bitizenship ===\nAlthough the game is free to download on both the [[App Store]] and [[Google Play]], in order to access certain features and remove [[advertisements]], the game has the option to purchase \"Bitizenship\" for real world money. Upon doing so, you become a \"Bitizen,\" a title displayed by a badge in the upper right corner of the screen when playing. This is currently a one-time purchase worldwide, although the developers of the game have experimented in select countries with making it a subscription-based purchase in the past. Such experiments were indefinitely terminated after it became widely known to players online that they were taking place at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1179817779970445312?s=21|title=Bitizens! There has been a lot of discussion about the subscription we have been testing in BitLife|date=2019-10-03|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\n== Development and updates ==\nThe game was originally released in September 2018 for iOS only, later being released on Android the following February. Since inception, the game has been updated many times to include large swaths of new features including siblings, pets, rekindling of broken relationships, more available countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Vietnam]], new ribbons, and the option to continue on as a character's children after your character dies, among hordes of other smaller features.\n\nUpdates adding new content are typically released every couple of weeks. Often, much of the new content added is suggested to the developers by users online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitlifeapp.com/|title=BitLife - Life Simulator|date=2019-06-25|website=candywriter.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> The game is owned and developed by Candywriter, LLC, which is based in Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"linked\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadirkhancandywriter|title=Nadir Khan|website=linkedin.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== iOS vs Android versions ===\nAs the [[iOS]] version of the game was released months prior the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version and the developers of the game are native to iOS when it comes to programming,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1138659063615541249?s=21|title=And now for a special message from us to all Android Bitizens|date=2019-06-11|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> the Android version currently lacks numerous features of iOS, such as the ability to make friends. Despite the differences, iOS and Android typically receive updates at the same frequency, and as a result most new features are typically added to iOS first, and then Android later on, though some features have not been added to Android in the same order as they were for iOS.\n\n===Notable iOS updates===\n====Character emoji updates====\nWhen the game was originally released, it lacked any visual representation of your character, showing only the flag of the country you lived in where it now displays your character's emoji. The original version of character emojis added was modeled off of the real [[emoji]] skin colours set, which resulted in \"yellow\" skinned models being controversially used to represent players' characters of [[East Asian]] background. Another update concerning character icons was released later on in May 2019 for iOS (September on Android), which added red-haired characters and [[hijabs]] for female characters in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], while also removing the \"yellow\" skinned models.\n\n====Fame update====\nA major update adding in the ability to become \"famous\" from certain careers along with various fame activities was released for iOS on April 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1121922113382670336|title=Don't let the fame go to your head!|date=2019-04-26|website=Twitter.com|access-date=2019-09-27|language=en}}</ref> Having been released in the wake of the [[2019 college admissions bribery scandal|college admissions scandal]] that had become widely publicized in the previous month, one notable new feature was the ability for your character (when \"famous\") to bribe college admissions officers to get your child into university. The update also dramatically raised the cap on money your character could earn, which had previously been limited to only $2,147,483,647 by the [[2,147,483,647#In computing|32-bit integer limit]]. By upgrading to a 64-bit limit, which has a maximum value of over 9 quintillions, the update effectively removed the limit on the amount of money your character could realistically make.\n\n====Prison life update====\nOn August 8, 2019, a major update that completely overhauled and expanded the [[prison]] aspect of the game was released to iOS users, adding the ability to join a [[prison gang]], take on a prison job, among other features, such as the addition of \"minimum\" and \"[[Supermax prison|maximum]]\" security prisons in place of previously having all prisons be the same security level. [[Capital punishment]] as well as [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]] were also added, ending a previous running gag of players simply being able to rake up an endless number of years in a sentence that could last well beyond an actual lifetime. While the update was generally well-received, sharp criticism ensued over a feature that allowed players to \"[[Prison rape|have their way]]\" with fellow inmates in the game. The feature was later removed in a patch released days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cpwg2v/where_is_have_your_way/|title=Where is have your way?|date=2019-08-13|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAs each fellow inmate in the game (who were viewable via the new \"prison yard\" feature) when you went to prison each displayed what they were \"in for\" on their profile, a lighthearted joke was added by the developers of the update where some inmates were in for \"complaining about BitLife Android,\" which drew some criticism from Android players who saw [[screenshot]]s of the feature online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cnqqcj/this_is_in_a_max_security_prison/|title=This is in a max security prison|date=2019-08-08|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> This feature was also later removed.\n\n====School life update====\nOn September 29, 2019, in celebration of the game's one year anniversary since launch, a major update adding in a host of new activities relating to school was released for iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_D_fzssD2o&t=29s|title=Bitlife School iOS Update|website=Bitlifeapp.online|date=2019-10-18|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1178717262758330368?s=21|title=The school update is out but we are not fully announcing it yet|website=Twitter.com|date=2019-09-30|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> New content included the ability to interact with classmates and teachers, join clubs and sports, a popularity meter and various \"cliques,\" [[fraternities and sororities]] at universities, a revamp of the different levels of schooling with respect to country, among many other features. The update also included new [[Professor|college professor]] and college dean occupations, and (notably) a new feature allowing your character (when a university student) to \"seduce\" and possibly \"[[One-night stand|hook up]]\" with college professors and the dean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1177032850115219456?s=21|title=emoji|date=2019-09-25|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe update was generally received well by players. One major bug that was reported within hours of launch involved a player's character being permanently stuck in \"middle school\" once enrolled, which also allowed for one to date classmates as young as age 10 despite being an adult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dbvku8/middle_school_fo_life_i_dont_know_how_or_why_that/|title=middle school fo life|date=2019-10-01|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> A patch was released several days after the initial update to correct this.\n\n====Office update====\nOn November 18, 2019, another major update adding in a host of new activities relating to jobs was released for iOS. New content included the ability to interact with co-workers and supervisors in a job, such as pranking, starting rumors and hooking up/seducing them. You can also report a co-worker to HR if they misbehave (in case of the military, you can file a grievance). Also you can beg their supervisor to stay if you get fired. (However, this is not available for military because these jobs are much stricter and will be rejected if they attempt to rejoin).\n\n====Friends update====\nOn December 19, 2019, another update was released for iOS.  This update added the ability to make friends and interact with them. Friends can be befriended from classmates, teachers, co-workers or supervisors. The player can also make best friends and enemies. By age 10, the player's character may ask them out. (Due to legal reasons, if the friend is 18 and you are under 18 or vice versa you cannot ask them out). After the character turns 12 years old, the player can go to a concert with their friend. The player can also prank or start a rumor with their friend. On December 25, 2019 in celebration of Christmas, a \"Santa Claus\" career was added exclusively for that day.\n\n====Crime update====\nOn January 17, 2020, a crime-related update was released for iOS. This update added 6 new crimes (bank robbery, behaving delinquently, paying a hitman, stealing a neighbor's mail, shoplifting, and train robbery), bringing the total to 10 from the previous 4. Also, it added the ability to commit a crime as a juvenile (starting at age 8) and go to juvenile detention. Also, escaping from juvenile detention may sometimes cause your parents to send you back.\n\n====Mind & Body Update====\nOn February 8, 2020, another major update was released for iOS. This update included a redesign of some of the game's elements, such as scenarios and people, and also added a \"Surprise me!\" feature, and a new disease system with symptoms. This update also added more mind & body activities, such as reading a book, going on a diet, going on a walk, and practicing martial arts.\n\n====Luxury Update====\nOn March 8, 2020, a dazzling update was released for iOS. This update added a new \"Go Shopping\" option in the activities and assets bar. Players can now buy yachts, boats, submarines, military jets, helicopters and planes up to 2 billion dollars. They've also added a \"Jewelers\" tab where you have the option to buy expensive jewelry with details stating carats and faux jewelry.Also they added a tab were you can go to change your hair style and colour.\n\n====God Mode Update====\nOn March 26, 2020, the most appraised update in BitLife was released for iOS Bitizens. This update added a new mode called \"God Mode\" which was free for 15 days due to COVID-19 during the time. It's around USD $4 and can allow players to edit their looks, and attributes such as fertility, karma, discipline and athleticism. Players can even edit other characters they know in their lives, and can even control their wealth. \n\n====Ribbons and Achievements Update====\nOn April 6, 2020, a new ribbons and achievements update was released for iOS. The Android version of the update was released on April 17, 2020. The update added 10 new ribbons and 75 new achievements. New Ribbons include \"Barbie Girl\", \"Tarzan\", \"Big Boss\", \"Veteran\". New achievements include \"Bitionaire\"(Achieve a net worth of $1b), \"Living Legacy\"(Achieve a 500-year generation), and \"Brightest Star\"(Achieve maximum fame).\n\n====Politics Update====\nOn April 19, 2020, an update concerning political careers was released for iOS. The update included an option to run for political offices, like the School Board Director, the Governor and even the President/Prime Minister. Players can read newspapers, run for re-elections, keep up approval ratings, broadcast speeches, and avoid/accept bribes and political favours.\n\n===Notable Android updates===\n====\"Ketchup\" updates====\nA series of three updates dubbed \"ketchup\" updates by the developers began to be released in late September 2019 for the Android version of the game, following the hire of a new Android engineer in order to speed up the process of bringing iOS content over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1168585932464742402?s=21|title=Android Bitizens!

On the day of Halloween itself, job occupations as a \"[[zombie]],\" a \"[[Witchcraft|witch]],\" and a \"[[vampire]]\" were available for 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1190288301586079744?s=20|title=It's my life mom, I'll be a zombie if I want to gosh!|date=2019-11-01|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dq03ya/jobs_as_vampires_witches_and_zombies_are/|title=Jobs as Vampires, Witches, and Zombies are available tonight!|website=reddit.com|date=2019-10-31|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\nUnlike prior major updates, this update was the first to be released for Android prior to iOS <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1188672885100990465?s=20|title=Android Bitizens!

This was also the first major update to be specifically centered on a holiday. Alongside the Halloween themed features, the update also added eight new playable countries to the iOS version, including [[Hong Kong]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1186859997314945024?s=20|title=Monaco is a tax-free principality nestled between the south of France and the next BitLife update|date=2019-10-22|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> while for the Android version it added the \"time machine\" feature,<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.candywriter.bitlife&hl=en_US|title=BitLife - Life Simulator|date=2019-10-31|website=Google Play|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> which allows players to de-age a character by anywhere from 1 to 20 years for a flat fee of $0.99.\n\nThe developers of the game have stated that the \"haunted\" houses are a permanent addition, as are all non-Halloween themed items from the update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1189213485772742656?s=20|title=After halloween, only the haunted houses will remain (out of the \"spooky\" stuff)|date=2019-10-29|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Purchase of InstLife ===\nOn June 17, 2019, it was announced by the developers of the game <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1140739735121358849?s=21|title=we're happy to announce that InstLife will be merged into BitLife over the coming months|date=2019-06-17|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> that BitLife had acquired another life simulator game named [[InstLife]] by [[InstCoffee]] (its main competitor at the time), and that content from the latter was to be merged into the former over the following months. The acquisition provoked polarizing reactions online, with many praising the merger and the new content it would ultimately bring to BitLife, while others (especially longtime InstLife users) sharply criticized it and accused Candywriter of trying to \"eliminate competition.\"\n\n== Online community ==\nSince the release of the game, the developers of BitLife have operated accounts on a handful of [[social media]] platforms, namely Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. In the game, each account is linked to players via the \"BitLife Community...\" tab. The developers frequently engage with players of the game on their various accounts, often taking and implementing suggestions from users in comments of their posts into the game.\n\n=== Android \"Beta-zin\" program ===\nSince the release of the Android version of the game, the developers of the game have run a [[Google Group]] called BitLife Beta,<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/bitlifebeta|title=BitLife Beta|website=groups.google.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> where registered members of the group can receive updates for the Android version ahead of their full release to all players. The group is used by the developers as a means of testing updates for bugs, with the expectation that members who receive and play the not yet released updates report any bugs they encounter to the developers so they can be eliminated prior to being released to everyone. Members of the group are referred to by the developers as \"Beta-zins,\" and can receive \"Bitizenship\" for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1213661683614273537?s=21|title=Android Beta-zins: a new update (v1.19) awaits you!|date=2020-01-04|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Reddit ===\nAs of January 2020, the r/BitLifeApp community on [[Reddit]] has more than 60,000 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/|title=r/BitLifeApp|date=2020-01-12|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Android ===\nUnfortunately, if you have Bitlife on an Android device you have to wait so much time before the IOS updates can be played on your device.\n\n== Reception ==\nOverall, the game has received positive ratings.

The first thing the app displays is who the character's parents are, and their occupation, as well as your birthday, [[star sign]], how you were conceived and if you have any siblings or pets. In some cases, your character may have been put up for adoption at birth. To add one year to your character's life, you press the \"Age\" button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/bitlife-life-simulator|title=BitLife - Life Simulator - App Review|date=2018-12-14|website=Common Sense Media|language=en|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Stages of a life ===\n==== Childhood ====\nBetween ages 0 and 5, you are considered an \"infant.\" Between ages 5 and 8, depending on the country you are playing in, you begin elementary or [[primary school]]. You then advance to the next level of schooling between ages 11 and 14, either \"[[middle school]]\" or \"[[secondary school]]\" depending on the country, and then (in some countries) to a final level of basic schooling by age 16. In middle school or secondary school, the option to join a school club becomes available, as well as the option to join a clique. All-female characters will also have their [[menarche]] randomly between ages 10 and 15. At age 10, it becomes possible to find a date or be asked out on one. Upon reaching age 12, activities to raise the character's four bars (happiness, health, smarts, and looks) start becoming available. Then by age 14, the option to get part-time or freelance jobs becomes available.\n\nDuring childhood, you are largely limited in activities to do. You may be able to ask your parents for money, depending on how generous or rich your parents are as shown by their \"generosity\" or \"money\" bar. Various pop-up scenarios may also appear depending on what age you are at. In your \"infancy\" for example, you may encounter scenarios involving your first words or being taken to get [[vaccine|vaccinated]]. Once you reach school age, scenarios involving activities with friends, your \"first kiss,\" school dances, or other events may appear.\n\n==== Adulthood ====\nBetween ages 15 and 19, depending on the country, you can take your [[driving test]], which is simply a test asking what a road sign means, contrary to real life. If you pass, you may receive a car from your parents depending on their generosity. After you graduate from secondary school, you can decide whether to continue your education, take time off, acquire a full-time occupation, or enlist in the military.\n\nAt age 18, the option to buy a house becomes available, as do all remaining activities such as clubbing, vacationing, [[emigration]], various crime options such as [[burglary]], and gambling. As you age through adulthood, random pop up scenarios will appear as you age requiring decisions that can have major effects on your life. Such scenarios generally involve your career, your health, your spouse and/or children (if you have any), your friends, as well as potential random encounters such as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] person asking for money, being a witness to a crime, having to decide whether to risk your life to save another, among others.\n\nAfter working for a certain number of years, the option to retire becomes available (the exact age of which varies by country). Many occupations will force you into [[retirement]] after a certain point, though in most full-time occupations you will receive a [[pension]] after retiring.\n\n==== Death ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife app death and gravestone.jpg|thumb|right|A gravestone with a ribbon on its upper left corner in BitLife]] -->\nIf you live your life without many harming consequences, you will die of natural causes. Generally, if you keep your health bar close to or at 100%, you will most likely live beyond [[Centenarian|100 years]], contrary to real life where few people live for that long. At the end of each life you are assigned a ribbon, based on how you lived your life. For example, \"Fertile\" ribbons are assigned for having lots of children. Some ribbons are easy to get while others are far more difficult to obtain. Currently, there are a total of 30 ribbons.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-ribbons-list-guide/|title=BitLife Ribbons List Guide|date=2019-06-13|website=progameguides.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> All previous lives you lived are viewable via a \"[[cemetery]]\". Many players believe that 124 is the maximum age in Bitlife, but it is possible to live much longer.\n\nAfter you die, you have the option of starting a new life (either customized or random), replaying the same character again with the option to make different choices, or continuing a \"legacy\" as your character's child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/03/27/bitlife-fame-live-on-as-your-child-and-everything-else-to-expect/|title=BitLife Update|date=2019-03-27|website=gamebozo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Character stats ===\nAt the bottom of the screen when playing are four bars showing the happiness, health, smarts, and looks of one's character between 0 and 100%. Each bar will randomly fluctuate each time the \"age\" button is pressed. Various activities can be performed to either raise or lower each of the bars, such as going to the gym to raise looks. The levels of a player's bars have major impacts on the lives of their characters. High smarts can allow one's character to receive a [[scholarship]] to university for example, while by contrast, low smarts can result in one's application to university being rejected altogether.\n\nCertain occupations in the game (such as an acting job) can make one become \"famous,\" at which point a fifth bar showing your level of \"fame\" is shown. If you fail to keep the fame bar above 0%, then the bar disappears and you are no longer \"famous.\" There is also another major bar concerning the character's \"[[karma]],\" which fluctuates depending on the nature of actions you take for good or bad. While the bar is never seen as one of the main bars at the bottom of the screen during gameplay, it can still have an effect on your character's life, and it is shown on your character's gravestone after death.\n\n=== Relationships ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife App relationships tab.jpeg|thumb|left|An example of the relationships tab in BitLife, showing a character's wife and siblings]] -->\nA core component of the game is \"relationships\" with [[NPCs]]. These include your parents, siblings, nieces/nephews, children, grandchildren, lovers, and friends you make. With every one of these characters, your character has a \"relationship bar\" that fluctuates randomly as you \"age\" and can be raised (or lowered) by interacting with them. If a relationship bar drops too low, then the family member or friend in question may refuse to interact with you.\n\nYour most important relationship is the one with your lover, with whom you may get married and/or have children. You may encounter potential lovers randomly as you play, in the \"love\" tab, at school, or in your workplace. In some cases, your parents may arrange for you to be married, especially if they have a high \"religiousness\" stat bar. After you date a lover for the first time, even if you break things off with them they will remain in your character's \"ex\" tab, allowing for the ability to get back together.\n\nAny [[pet]]s you have also have a relationship bar with you and are listed alongside other family members and friends of yours with unique interactions, tailored specifically to the type of animal the pet is.\n\n=== Occupations ===\nThere are several types of job occupations that a player may take up within the game. Most full-time jobs require a certain level of education, with some requiring you to attend a specialized school, such as a veterinary school for a [[veterinarian]] occupation. Other jobs may simply require a certain character stat to be at a high level, such as high looks to be a [[Model (person)|model]]. All full-time jobs also require an \"interview\" before you are hired, which is simply a random question you must answer. Alongside full-time jobs, there are also [[Part-time contract|part-time]] jobs which a player may take up alongside a full-time occupation such as school, as well as \"[[freelancer|freelance]]\" jobs that can be taken up at random for quick cash, like [[babysitting]] and [[lawn mowing]].\n\nEach job comes with a certain number of \"hours\" of work. The hours your character works can vary widely, depending on the country and whether the job is full or part-time. In total, it is possible to have a \"schedule\" of up to 70 hours a week in the game, though a high number of hours puts the player's character at risk of contracting [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and ultimately a [[heart attack]].\n\n=== Countries ===\n[[File: Countries in BitLife detailed.png|thumb|right|A world map showing all the playable countries in BitLife]]\nThe game has dozens of different countries for a player to play a life in. Depending on the country, certain activities such as gambling, same-sex marriage, or abortion may be legal or illegal. Cost of living, incomes, and life expectancy vary by country as well, as do tax rates, with some countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] having no taxes at all in-game. Playing in certain countries such as [[Afghanistan]] is also made more dangerous by a small chance that each time you hit the \"age\" button, you can be randomly killed in a sort of \"terrorist\" attack. Another notable difference is that when playing in [[South America]]n countries, llamas will replace horses in the pet store.\n\n[[Puerto Rico]], despite being a territory of the [[United States]], stands as its own independent \"country\" in the game due to differences in common names.\n\nEvery country also comes with a handful of cities one can select to play in, such as [[Warsaw, Poland]]. In two cities ([[Miami]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the United States) in the game, which in real life are host to the headquarters of BitLife's developers, it is possible for your character to get a job working for Candywriter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/01/10/bitlife-life-simulator-how-to-get-the-teammate-ribbon/|title=BitLife Life Simulator: How to Get the Teammate Ribbon|date=2019-01-10|website=Gamebozo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Minigames ===\nWithin the game, there are various [[minigames]] you may encounter when performing certain actions. In the casino, for example, there is a [[blackjack]] minigame you can bet money on. Another example involves the option to solve a puzzle that involves maneuvering around a guard to escape from prison, which changes in difficulty depending upon the security level of the prison the player's character is in. There is also a minigame based on [[Snake (video game genre)|the 1978 game Snake]] which one may play while in prison to start a [[Prison riot|riot]]. When serving in the military, you can occasionally be sent to a random country on \"deployment,\" in which case you must solve a [[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]-type minigame (regardless of the branch) without detonating a [[land mine]].\n\n=== Heirlooms ===\nSince August 2019, the game has featured collectible \"[[heirloom]]\" items, with the ability for a player to collect a new one once per day. Upon receiving an heirloom, it appears alongside a character's \"assets,\" and you may have the options to refurbish it, play with it, sell or donate it. If you continue as a character's child after death, the heirloom is passed down to the child. Over time as you \"age,\" the value of the heirloom will rise exponentially. A list of all heirlooms the player has collected is found in the main menu. It is possible to collect the same heirloom more than once.\n\nCertain heirlooms are rarer than others, with the rarest ones being called \"super rare.\" Notable rare heirlooms include the [[Holy Grail]], a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] gas pump, and [[Donald Trump]]'s golden toilet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-heirlooms-list-guide/|title=BitLife Heirlooms List Guide|date=2019-08-22|website=progameguides.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Generally the rarer an heirloom is, the more monetary value it has, though this is not always the case.\n\n=== Temporary features ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BitLife Santa job occupation.jpg|thumb|left|A \"Santa Claus\" job occupation available during the Christmas season in BitLife]] -->\nThe game has periodically included various temporary features in recognition of certain events. On certain holidays for example, the game has made available temporary job occupations, such as an \"[[elf]]\" occupation in recognition of [[Christmas]],<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eexhtp/so_this_is_bitlife/|title=So this is BitLife...|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> a \"pilgrim\" occupation in recognition of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] where you were employed by the [[Plymouth Colony]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/e30vfh/you_can_be_a_pilgrim_now_screenshot_taken/|title=You can be a pilgrim now!|date=2019-11-28|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> and a \"[[leprechaun]]\" occupation in recognition of [[St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1107672493605699587?s=20|title=Who was feeling lucky yesterday?|date=2019-03-18|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Besides temporary job occupations, the game has also seen the addition of other features for holidays such as various pop-up scenarios, one notable example being the ability to attempt to \"kiss\" your cousin under the [[mistletoe]], which was added during the 2019 Christmas season and required you to hit a confirm button multiple times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eetf8u/so_i_wanted_to_see_what_would_happen_if_i_kissed/|title=So I wanted to see what would happen if I kissed my cousin and it literally asked me 10 times if I was sure|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nAlongside temporary holiday-themed features, since July 2019, the game has also featured pop up scenarios relating to \"current\" events. Notable ones have included an option for your character to pick a side in the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1147963494886567936?s=20|title=Congratulations #USWNT|date=2019-07-07|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> and an option to decide whether or not to join in on the Facebook event to [[Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us|storm Area 51]].\n\n=== Bitizenship ===\nAlthough the game is free to download on both the [[App Store]] and [[Google Play]], in order to access certain features and remove [[advertisements]], the game has the option to purchase \"Bitizenship\" for real world money. Upon doing so, you become a \"Bitizen,\" a title displayed by a badge in the upper right corner of the screen when playing. This is currently a one-time purchase worldwide, although the developers of the game have experimented in select countries with making it a subscription-based purchase in the past. Such experiments were indefinitely terminated after it became widely known to players online that they were taking place at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1179817779970445312?s=21|title=Bitizens! There has been a lot of discussion about the subscription we have been testing in BitLife|date=2019-10-03|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\n== Development and updates ==\nThe game was originally released in September 2018 for iOS only, later being released on Android the following February. Since inception, the game has been updated many times to include large swaths of new features including siblings, pets, rekindling of broken relationships, more available countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Vietnam]], new ribbons, and the option to continue on as a character's children after your character dies, among hordes of other smaller features.\n\nUpdates adding new content are typically released every couple of weeks. Often, much of the new content added is suggested to the developers by users online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitlifeapp.com/|title=BitLife - Life Simulator|date=2019-06-25|website=candywriter.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> The game is owned and developed by Candywriter, LLC, which is based in Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"linked\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadirkhancandywriter|title=Nadir Khan|website=linkedin.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== iOS vs Android versions ===\nAs the [[iOS]] version of the game was released months prior the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version and the developers of the game are native to iOS when it comes to programming,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1138659063615541249?s=21|title=And now for a special message from us to all Android Bitizens|date=2019-06-11|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> the Android version currently lacks numerous features of iOS, such as the ability to make friends. Despite the differences, iOS and Android typically receive updates at the same frequency, and as a result most new features are typically added to iOS first, and then Android later on, though some features have not been added to Android in the same order as they were for iOS.\n\n===Notable iOS updates===\n====Character emoji updates====\nWhen the game was originally released, it lacked any visual representation of your character, showing only the flag of the country you lived in where it now displays your character's emoji. The original version of character emojis added was modeled off of the real [[emoji]] skin colours set, which resulted in \"yellow\" skinned models being controversially used to represent players' characters of [[East Asian]] background. Another update concerning character icons was released later on in May 2019 for iOS (September on Android), which added red-haired characters and [[hijabs]] for female characters in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], while also removing the \"yellow\" skinned models.\n\n====Fame update====\nA major update adding in the ability to become \"famous\" from certain careers along with various fame activities was released for iOS on April 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1121922113382670336|title=Don't let the fame go to your head!|date=2019-04-26|website=Twitter.com|access-date=2019-09-27|language=en}}</ref> Having been released in the wake of the [[2019 college admissions bribery scandal|college admissions scandal]] that had become widely publicized in the previous month, one notable new feature was the ability for your character (when \"famous\") to bribe college admissions officers to get your child into university. The update also dramatically raised the cap on money your character could earn, which had previously been limited to only $2,147,483,647 by the [[2,147,483,647#In computing|32-bit integer limit]]. By upgrading to a 64-bit limit, which has a maximum value of over 9 quintillions, the update effectively removed the limit on the amount of money your character could realistically make.\n\n====Prison life update====\nOn August 8, 2019, a major update that completely overhauled and expanded the [[prison]] aspect of the game was released to iOS users, adding the ability to join a [[prison gang]], take on a prison job, among other features, such as the addition of \"minimum\" and \"[[Supermax prison|maximum]]\" security prisons in place of previously having all prisons be the same security level. [[Capital punishment]] as well as [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]] were also added, ending a previous running gag of players simply being able to rake up an endless number of years in a sentence that could last well beyond an actual lifetime. While the update was generally well-received, sharp criticism ensued over a feature that allowed players to \"[[Prison rape|have their way]]\" with fellow inmates in the game. The feature was later removed in a patch released days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cpwg2v/where_is_have_your_way/|title=Where is have your way?|date=2019-08-13|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAs each fellow inmate in the game (who were viewable via the new \"prison yard\" feature) when you went to prison each displayed what they were \"in for\" on their profile, a lighthearted joke was added by the developers of the update where some inmates were in for \"complaining about BitLife Android,\" which drew some criticism from Android players who saw [[screenshot]]s of the feature online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cnqqcj/this_is_in_a_max_security_prison/|title=This is in a max security prison|date=2019-08-08|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> This feature was also later removed.\n\n====School life update====\nOn September 29, 2019, in celebration of the game's one year anniversary since launch, a major update adding in a host of new activities relating to school was released for iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_D_fzssD2o&t=29s|title=Bitlife School iOS Update|website=Bitlifeapp.online|date=2019-10-18|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1178717262758330368?s=21|title=The school update is out but we are not fully announcing it yet|website=Twitter.com|date=2019-09-30|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> New content included the ability to interact with classmates and teachers, join clubs and sports, a popularity meter and various \"cliques,\" [[fraternities and sororities]] at universities, a revamp of the different levels of schooling with respect to country, among many other features. The update also included new [[Professor|college professor]] and college dean occupations, and (notably) a new feature allowing your character (when a university student) to \"seduce\" and possibly \"[[One-night stand|hook up]]\" with college professors and the dean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1177032850115219456?s=21|title=emoji|date=2019-09-25|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe update was generally received well by players. One major bug that was reported within hours of launch involved a player's character being permanently stuck in \"middle school\" once enrolled, which also allowed for one to date classmates as young as age 10 despite being an adult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dbvku8/middle_school_fo_life_i_dont_know_how_or_why_that/|title=middle school fo life|date=2019-10-01|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> A patch was released several days after the initial update to correct this.\n\n====Office update====\nOn November 18, 2019, another major update adding in a host of new activities relating to jobs was released for iOS. New content included the ability to interact with co-workers and supervisors in a job, such as pranking, starting rumors and hooking up/seducing them. You can also report a co-worker to HR if they misbehave (in case of the military, you can file a grievance). Also you can beg their supervisor to stay if you get fired. (However, this is not available for military because these jobs are much stricter and will be rejected if they attempt to rejoin).\n\n====Friends update====\nOn December 19, 2019, another update was released for iOS.  This update added the ability to make friends and interact with them. Friends can be befriended from classmates, teachers, co-workers or supervisors. The player can also make best friends and enemies. By age 10, the player's character may ask them out. (Due to legal reasons, if the friend is 18 and you are under 18 or vice versa you cannot ask them out). After the character turns 12 years old, the player can go to a concert with their friend. The player can also prank or start a rumor with their friend. On December 25, 2019 in celebration of Christmas, a \"Santa Claus\" career was added exclusively for that day.\n\n====Crime update====\nOn January 17, 2020, a crime-related update was released for iOS. This update added 6 new crimes (bank robbery, behaving delinquently, paying a hitman, stealing a neighbor's mail, shoplifting, and train robbery), bringing the total to 10 from the previous 4. Also, it added the ability to commit a crime as a juvenile (starting at age 8) and go to juvenile detention. Also, escaping from juvenile detention may sometimes cause your parents to send you back.\n\n====Mind & Body Update====\nOn February 8, 2020, another major update was released for iOS. This update included a redesign of some of the game's elements, such as scenarios and people, and also added a \"Surprise me!\" feature, and a new disease system with symptoms. This update also added more mind & body activities, such as reading a book, going on a diet, going on a walk, and practicing martial arts.\n\n====Luxury Update====\nOn March 8, 2020, a dazzling update was released for iOS. This update added a new \"Go Shopping\" option in the activities and assets bar. Players can now buy yachts, boats, submarines, military jets, helicopters and planes up to 2 billion dollars. They've also added a \"Jewelers\" tab where you have the option to buy expensive jewelry with details stating carats and faux jewelry.\n\n====God Mode Update====\nOn March 26, 2020, the most appraised update in BitLife was released for iOS Bitizens. This update added a new mode called \"God Mode\" which was free for 15 days due to COVID-19 during the time. It's around USD $4 and can allow players to edit their looks, and attributes such as fertility, karma, discipline and athleticism. Players can even edit other characters they know in their lives, and can even control their wealth. \n\n====Ribbons and Achievements Update====\nOn April 6, 2020, a new ribbons and achievements update was released for iOS. The Android version of the update was released on April 17, 2020. The update added 10 new ribbons and 75 new achievements. New Ribbons include \"Barbie Girl\", \"Tarzan\", \"Big Boss\", \"Veteran\". New achievements include \"Bitionaire\"(Achieve a net worth of $1b), \"Living Legacy\"(Achieve a 500-year generation), and \"Brightest Star\"(Achieve maximum fame).\n\n====Politics Update====\nOn April 19, 2020, an update concerning political careers was released for iOS. The update included an option to run for political offices, like the School Board Director, the Governor and even the President/Prime Minister. Players can read newspapers, run for re-elections, keep up approval ratings, broadcast speeches, and avoid/accept bribes and political favours.\n\n===Notable Android updates===\n====\"Ketchup\" updates====\nA series of three updates dubbed \"ketchup\" updates by the developers began to be released in late September 2019 for the Android version of the game, following the hire of a new Android engineer in order to speed up the process of bringing iOS content over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1168585932464742402?s=21|title=Android Bitizens!

The flavoring is usually in a separate packet, although in the case of [[cup noodles]], the flavoring is often loose in the cup. Some instant noodle products are seal packed; these can be reheated or eaten straight from the packet/container. Dried noodle blocks are designed to be cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating but can be consumed dry.\n\nThe main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually [[wheat flour]], [[palm oil]], and salt. Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are [[salt]], [[monosodium glutamate]], seasoning, and [[sugar]]. The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, but air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.\n\nInstant noodles were invented by [[Momofuku Ando]] of [[Nissin Foods]] in Japan.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6237013.stm \"Inventor of instant noodles dies\"] [[BBC News]]. 6 January 2007</ref> They were launched in 1958 under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]]. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Cup Noodles]], the first [[cup noodle]] product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under [[List of instant noodle brands|many brand names]].\n\n[[Ramen]], a Japanese [[noodle soup]], is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y0xVkgXZOfUC&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=137|title=Culture and Customs of Indonesia|first = Jill | last = Forshee | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-313-33339-2}}</ref>\n\nDue to the versatility of instant noodles, it can be used as an alternative to typical long noodles such as spaghetti. It is used to make dishes such as ramen carbonara, [[Budae-jjigae|Korean army stew]], and even chow mein.\n\n==History==\nInstant noodles were created by inventor [[Momofuku Ando]] in Japan. It was first marketed on 25 August 1958 by Ando's company, [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_instant_noodle |title=The Eternal Life of the Instant Noodle|publisher=BBC|date= 28 September 2018|accessdate=10 March 2020|author=Celia Hatton}}</ref> Ando developed the entire production method of flash frying noodles from processes of noodle-making, steaming, seasoning, to dehydrating in oil heat, creating the \"instant\" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of [[frozen noodles]]. Each noodle block was pre-seasoned and sold for 35 yen. The instant noodle became ready to eat just in two minutes by adding boiling water. Due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item initially, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price.<ref>{{cite news | last=Beech| first=Hannah| title=Momofuku Ando|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1554981,00.html| work=Time| date=13 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nissin Foods \u2013 About Us |url=http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024113621/http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |archivedate=24 October 2007 |date=2018-11-22 }}</ref> Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by [[Mitsubishi Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Inventor of the Week Archive: Momofuku Ando|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/ando.html| publisher=MIT}}</ref> Initially gaining popularity across [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], where they are now firmly embedded within the local cultures of those regions, instant noodles eventually spread to and gained popularity across most other parts of the world.<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/3790-instant-noodles-will-either-save-the-world-or-ruin-it |title=Instant Noodles Will Either Save the World or Ruin It|last=Burmon|first= Andrew |date=11 June 2015 |publisher=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2016/01/25/embrace-instant-noodle |title=Embrace the instant noodle\n|last=Bartholomeusz|first= Rachel |date=11 May 2016 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nWith better quality concern, manufacturers further improved the taste of instant noodles by adding flavoring powder in a separate packet. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Nissin Cup Noodles]], a [[cup noodle]] to which boiling water is added to cook the noodles. A further innovation added dried vegetables to the cup, creating a complete instant soup dish. It combined the functions of packaging material, cooker when boiling water, and a bowl when eating noodles. Heading off the recent rise in health-consciousness, many manufacturers launched instant noodles with various healthy recipes: noodles with dietary fiber and collagen, low-calorie noodles, and low-sodium noodles.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of instant noodles |url=https://instantnoodles.org/en/noodles/index.html |website=World instant noodles association |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a Japanese poll in the year 2000, \"The Japanese believe that their best invention of the twentieth century was instant noodles.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Japan votes noodle the tops|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1067506.stm | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | work=BBC News | date=12 December 2000}} BBC News</ref> {{As of|2018||df=}}, approximately 103 billion servings of instant noodles are eaten worldwide every year.

For instant noodles, flours which have 8.5-12.5% protein are optimal because noodles must be able to withstand the drying process without breaking apart, which requires a higher amount of protein in flour, and during frying, high protein content can help decrease the fat uptake.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Gluten]], which is made up of glutenin and gliadin, is the most important wheat protein that forms the continuous viscoelastic dough of noodles. The development of gluten structures and the networking between gluten and starches during [[kneading]] is very important to the elasticity and continuity of the dough.\n\n=== Water ===\nWater is the second most important raw material for making noodles after flour. The hydration of dough determines the development of gluten structure, which affects the viscoelastic properties of dough. The water absorption level for making noodles is about 30% - 38% of flour weight; if the water absorption level is too high, hydration of flour can not be completed, and if the water absorption level is too low, the dough will be too sticky to handle during processing.<ref name=\":0\" /> For instant noodles, dehydration is an important step after noodles are made because water can offer a hospitable environment for microorganisms. Depending on dehydration methods, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has regulation on moisture content of instant noodles: for instant noodles dehydrated by frying, moisture content cannot exceed 8%, and for those dehydrated by methods other than frying, moisture content cannot exceed 14.5%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Salt ===\nSalt is added when making the flour dough to strengthen gluten structures and enhance the sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is to slow down the activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because [[flavonoid]] pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese [[ramen]], this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.<ref name=\":0\" /> One pack of ramen contains well over half the daily recommended amount of sodium.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/ramen-facts-you-did-not-know|title=7 Fast Facts About Instant Ramen|date=2015-04-02|work=Spoon University|accessdate=2017-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Kansui ===\nKansui, an alkaline solution consisting usually of a 9:1 ratio of sodium carbonate to potassium carbonate, is added to the flour and water when making ramen to help develop several of its unique characteristics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Asian noodles : science, technology, and processing|others=Hou, Gary G.|isbn=9780470179222|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=907642187|last1=Hou|first1=Gary G.|date=26 October 2010}}</ref> The addition of kansui aids in the gluten development of the noodle as well as promotion of gelatinization of starches, both of which contribute to the springiness and chewiness characteristic of ramen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Man|last2=Sun|first2=Qing-Jie|last3=Han|first3=Chuan-Wu|last4=Chen|first4=Hai-Hua|last5=Tang|first5=Wen-Ting|title=Comparative study of the quality characteristics of fresh noodles with regular salt and alkali and the underlying mechanisms|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=246|pages=335\u2013342|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.020|pmid=29291858|year=2018}}</ref> Additionally, the addition of kansui enhances the yellow color of ramen noodles by bringing about [[Chromophore|chromophoric]] shift of several compounds called [[flavonoid]]s that are native to wheat flour.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Oil ===\n[[Frying]] is a common dehydration process for producing instant noodles. Therefore, oil becomes an important component of instant noodles. According to USDA regulation, oil-fried instant noodles should not have fat content higher than 20% of total weight, which means theoretically, the amount of oil uptake during frying process could go even higher. [[Palm oil]] is always chosen as the frying oil for instant noodles due to its heat stability and low cost. However, overall, due to the high-fat content and low moisture content, instant noodles are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation, and relatively high amount of preservatives are added. Hence, to avoid the generation of off-flavours and health-risking compounds, some instant noodles were dehydrated by ways other than frying to reduce the fat content. According to USDA, un-fried instant noodles should have fat content lower than 3%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Starches ===\nPotato starches are commonly added in instant noodles to enhance gelling properties and water-holding capacities of noodles. Gelling properties could enhance the elasticity and chewiness of instant noodles, and water holding capacities could improve the smooth and shiny look of noodles after cooking and shorten the cooking time.\n\n=== Polyphosphates ===\n[[Polyphosphate]] is used in instant noodles as additive to improve [[starch gelatinization]] during cooking (rehydration) to allow more water retention in the noodles. Normally 0.1% of flour weight phosphate compounds are added to water before mixing and making the dough.\n\n=== Hydrocolloids ===\nHydrocolloids such as guar gum are widely used in instant noodles production to enhance water binding capacity during rehydration and shorten the cooking time. Gums are dispersed in water before mixing and making noodles dough.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gulia|first=Neelam|last2=Dhaka|first2=Vandana|last3=Khatkar|first3=B.

There are variations to the ingredients used depending on the country of origin in terms of the salt content and the flour content.\n\nNoodle production starts with dissolving the salt, starch, and flavoring in water to form a mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left for a period of time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop [[gluten]] more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow-paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, they are ready to be steamed for 1\u20135 minutes at {{convert|100|C}} to improve its texture by [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinizing]] the starch of the noodles. When steaming, the addition of water and heat breaks up the helix structure and crystallinity of amylose. Amylose begins to diffuse out of the starch granule and forms a gel matrix around the granule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xteiARU46SQC&dq=food+chemistry+book|title=Food Chemistry|last=Belitz|first=H.-D.|last2=Grosch|first2=Werner|last3=Schieberle|first3=Peter|date=2009-01-15|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783540699330|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Drying ===\nNext, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1\u20132 minutes at a temperature of {{convert|140|\u2013|160|C}}. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30\u201350% to 2\u20135%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of [[Canola oil|canola]], [[Cottonseed oil|cottonseed]] and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30\u201340 minutes in hot air at a temperature of {{convert|70|\u2013|90|C}}, resulting in a moisture content of 8\u201312%. During the drying process, the rapid evaporation of water creates pores throughout the food matrix, which allows for short cooking times in the finished product. In the case of fried noodles, the creation of pores is directly related to the uptake of fat into the noodles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellema|first=M.|title=Mechanism and reduction of fat uptake in deep-fat fried foods|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|volume=14|issue=9|pages=364\u2013373|doi=10.1016/s0924-2244(03)00050-5|year=2003}}</ref> More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15\u201320% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Packaging ===\nBefore packaging with seasoning, the noodles are cooled after drying, and their quality of moisture, color, and shape are checked. Packaging of the noodles include films impermeable to air and water. There are two forms of packaged instant noodles, one in a bag with the provided seasoning in small sachets inside, or [[Cup noodle|in a cup]] with seasoning on the top of the noodles. There are a variety of flavors to the noodles depending on which ones are added to the seasoning. Such flavors include beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, oriental, etc. In [[Cup noodle|instant noodle cups]], soy protein and dehydrated vegetables and meats are often added for further flavor.\n\nThe shelf life of instant noodles ranges from 4\u201312 months, depending on environmental factors. Their stability comes from the high sodium content with low moisture, and low water activity. Instant noodles can be served after 1\u20132 minutes in boiled water or soaked in hot water for 3\u20134 minutes.<ref>USAID. ''Fortification Basis.

After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll slitters. The conveyor belt which transports the noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of the blades on the slitters; therefore, the sheet could be pressed multiple times up and down to produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, the sheets undergo steaming and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of the noodles.\n\n=== Elasticity ===\nAlthough dry instant noodles may not appear elastic, cooked instant noodles generally have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, giving the noodle strands spring-like qualities. The wavy form of the noodles is created when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due to the difference between the velocities of the conveyor belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, creating the unique wavy form of instant noodles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Binxiao|year=2007|title=Asian noodles: History, classification, raw materials, and processing|url=|journal=Food Research International|volume=41|issue=9|pages=888\u2013902|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2007.11.007}}</ref> During pressing by the heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are broken during processing,<ref name=\":0\" /> resulting in more viscoelastic noodle dough and thus more elastic noodles. Furthermore, [[potato starch]], a key ingredient in instant noodles, has the important characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling.<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, the addition of starch could further increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increases the elasticity of noodle strands, as its dissolved ions strengthen the interaction between gluten structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rombouts|first=Ine|last2=Jansens|first2=Koen J.A.|last3=Lagrain|first3=Bert|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|last5=Zhu|first5=Ke-Xue|title=The impact of salt and alkali on gluten polymerization and quality of fresh wheat noodles|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=60|issue=3|pages=507\u2013513|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2014.09.003|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Short cooking time ===\nThe initial purpose of inventing instant noodles was to shorten the cooking time of conventional noodles. Therefore, a short cooking time could be regarded as the most decisive characteristic of instant noodles. Instant noodles are cooked in boiled water; therefore, enhancing water retention is the major method to shorten cooking time.\n\n[[Starch gelatinization]] is the most important feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch gelatinization, which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch gelatinization occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, [[amylose]]s leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the gelatinization of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and gelatinization continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch gelatinization. Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, as a common additive, [[guar gum]] can not only increase the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouthfeel, it can also increase the water binding ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.\n\n== Health and safety concerns ==\n===Nutritional value===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 2.JPG|thumb|A serving of [[Indomie Mi goreng]], with [[fried egg]] and vegetables.

North Korean visitors to China also frequently purchase South Korean ramyeon from Chinese stores, where Shin Ramyeon is known as \"Korean Tangmi Ramyeon.\"\n\nIndigenous production of Ramyeon in North Korea began in 2000. The first Ramyeon brand was \"kkoburang guksu,\" which literally means \"curly noodles\" in Korean. Later, a joint venture by North Korean and Hong Kong-based companies began producing \"j\u016dks\u014fk guksu,\" ({{lang-ko|\uc989\uc11d \uad6d\uc218, \u537d\u5e2d \uad6d\uc218}}) which literally means \"instant noodles.\" Ramy\u014fn is popular among North Korean [[elite]]s who live in Pyongyang and [[Nampo]].

The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as \"yum Mama\". This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Another method is to [[stir fry]] the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are also sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real dehydrated meat such as pork or beef. The average retail price is about six baht for the regular size<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" /> and 10 baht for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFor years, sales of MAMA noodles was considered a barometer of the Thai economy, with consumption rising when times were lean. This has not been the case recently. In 2014, when the political crisis slowed Thailand's economic growth to 0.9 percent and eventually led to a military coup, the growth of MAMA noodle sales hit a low of one percent. In 2015, when the military government could not lift the country beyond an estimated 2.8 percent growth, sales of MAMA noodles only grew 0.4 percent\u2014a record low. Saha Pathanapibul's vice-president, Vathit Chokwatana, attributed the poor sales to falling commodity prices, which have weakened the purchasing power of rural people.<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" />\n\n===United Kingdom===\nA common form of instant noodles in Britain is [[Pot Noodle]], a [[cup noodle]] first marketed by [[Golden Wonder]] in the late 1970s, and acquired by [[Unilever]] in 1995. These use artificial flavorings and are generally suitable for [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] (there is no chicken in Chicken Pot Noodles, for example) and are sold by virtually every major supermarket chain, general groceries shops, and convenience stores.\n\nPacket noodles such as [[Batchelors]]' [[Super Noodles]] are also sold. Several of the larger supermarkets sell eastern brands such as [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], [[Koka noodles]] and [[Shin Ramyun]], which once could only be found in Asian groceries. Larger retail chains may offer their own brand in basic packaging and a variety of flavors, e.g., [[Asda]], while noodles such as [[Maggi]] can also be found in many groceries, but are less widespread. [[Kabuto Noodles]], launched in 2010, was the UKs first up-market instant noodle brand <ref>{{cite news|author=Rebecca Burn-Callander, Enterprise Editor |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/14/meet-the-british-firm-selling-pot-noodles-to-china/ |title=Meet the British firm selling pot noodles to China |date=2016-05-14 |accessdate=2017-07-04|newspaper=The Telegraph }}</ref> followed by Itsu and [[Mr Lee's Noodles]].<ref name=\"BP-20190603\" />\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, instant noodles were first available by [[Nissin Foods]] in 1971. In 1972, Nissin Foods introduced \"Nissin [[Cup Noodles]]\" in a [[foam food container|foam food cup]], which led to an upsurge in popularity. Soon after, many other competing companies were offering similar instant noodle products.\n\n{{anchor|Oodles of Noodles}}Today, in the U.S., the instant noodle is commonly known as ''ramen'', after [[Ramen|the Japanese dish]] on which it was originally based, and it comes in a variety of mostly meat-based flavors such as [[beef]], [[chicken]] and [[shrimp]]. Some prominent brands are [[Nissin Foods]] brand [[Top Ramen]] (originally Top Ramen's Oodles of Noodles), [[Maruchan]] Ramen, and [[Sapporo Ichiban]]. A wide range of popular brands imported from other countries are available at many Asian grocery stores and some supermarkets. Instant ramen noodles are extremely popular among students and other people of low income, due to their ease of preparation, versatility, and unusually low cost. While price varies throughout the U.S., generally several packages can be purchased for 25 cents or less.\n\nIn the [[Incarceration in the United States|prison system]], ramen packets have become a form of [[currency]], comprising a mainstay of the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] there.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why ramen is so valuable in prison |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLt9fRYT92M |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Instant-noodle-isle-2007.jpg|thumb|The instant noodle aisle in a supermarket at the Saigon Tax Trade Center, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]]\n\nInstant noodles are popular in Vietnam, where they are often eaten as a breakfast food.

The flavoring is usually in a separate packet, although in the case of [[cup noodles]], the flavoring is often loose in the cup. Some instant noodle products are seal packed; these can be reheated or eaten straight from the packet/container. Dried noodle blocks are designed to be cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating but can be consumed dry.\n\nThe main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually [[wheat flour]], [[palm oil]], and salt. Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are [[salt]], [[monosodium glutamate]], seasoning, and [[sugar]]. The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, but air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.\n\nInstant noodles were invented by [[Momofuku Ando]] of [[Nissin Foods]] in Japan.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6237013.stm \"Inventor of instant noodles dies\"] [[BBC News]]. 6 January 2007</ref> They were launched in 1958 under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]]. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Cup Noodles]], the first [[cup noodle]] product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under [[List of instant noodle brands|many brand names]].\n\n[[Ramen]], a Japanese [[noodle soup]], is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y0xVkgXZOfUC&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=137|title=Culture and Customs of Indonesia|first = Jill | last = Forshee | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-313-33339-2}}</ref>\n\nDue to the versatility of instant noodles, it can be used as an alternative to typical long noodles such as spaghetti. It is used to make dishes such as ramen carbonara, [[Budae-jjigae|Korean army stew]], and even chow mein.\n\n==History==\nInstant noodles were created by inventor [[Momofuku Ando]] in Japan. It was first marketed on 25 August 1958 by Ando's company, [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_instant_noodle |title=The Eternal Life of the Instant Noodle|publisher=BBC|date= 28 September 2018|accessdate=10 March 2020|author=Celia Hatton}}</ref> Ando developed the entire production method of flash frying noodles from processes of noodle-making, steaming, seasoning, to dehydrating in oil heat, creating the \"instant\" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of [[frozen noodles]]. Each noodle block was pre-seasoned and sold for 35 yen. The instant noodle became ready to eat just in two minutes by adding boiling water. Due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item initially, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price.<ref>{{cite news | last=Beech| first=Hannah| title=Momofuku Ando|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1554981,00.html| work=Time| date=13 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nissin Foods \u2013 About Us |url=http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024113621/http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |archivedate=24 October 2007 |date=2018-11-22 }}</ref> Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by [[Mitsubishi Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Inventor of the Week Archive: Momofuku Ando|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/ando.html| publisher=MIT}}</ref> Initially gaining popularity across [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], where they are now firmly embedded within the local cultures of those regions, instant noodles eventually spread to and gained popularity across most other parts of the world.<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/3790-instant-noodles-will-either-save-the-world-or-ruin-it |title=Instant Noodles Will Either Save the World or Ruin It|last=Burmon|first= Andrew |date=11 June 2015 |publisher=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2016/01/25/embrace-instant-noodle |title=Embrace the instant noodle\n|last=Bartholomeusz|first= Rachel |date=11 May 2016 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nWith better quality concern, manufacturers further improved the taste of instant noodles by adding flavoring powder in a separate packet. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Nissin Cup Noodles]], a [[cup noodle]] to which boiling water is added to cook the noodles. A further innovation added dried vegetables to the cup, creating a complete instant soup dish. It combined the functions of packaging material, cooker when boiling water, and a bowl when eating noodles. Heading off the recent rise in health-consciousness, many manufacturers launched instant noodles with various healthy recipes: noodles with dietary fiber and collagen, low-calorie noodles, and low-sodium noodles.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of instant noodles |url=https://instantnoodles.org/en/noodles/index.html |website=World instant noodles association |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a Japanese poll in the year 2000, \"The Japanese believe that their best invention of the twentieth century was instant noodles.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Japan votes noodle the tops|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1067506.stm | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | work=BBC News | date=12 December 2000}} BBC News</ref> {{As of|2018||df=}}, approximately 103 billion servings of instant noodles are eaten worldwide every year.

For instant noodles, flours which have 8.5-12.5% protein are optimal because noodles must be able to withstand the drying process without breaking apart, which requires a higher amount of protein in flour, and during frying, high protein content can help decrease the fat uptake.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Gluten]], which is made up of glutenin and gliadin, is the most important wheat protein that forms the continuous viscoelastic dough of noodles. The development of gluten structures and the networking between gluten and starches during [[kneading]] is very important to the elasticity and continuity of the dough.\n\n=== Water ===\nWater is the second most important raw material for making noodles after flour. The hydration of dough determines the development of gluten structure, which affects the viscoelastic properties of dough. The water absorption level for making noodles is about 30% - 38% of flour weight; if the water absorption level is too high, hydration of flour can not be completed, and if the water absorption level is too low, the dough will be too sticky to handle during processing.<ref name=\":0\" /> For instant noodles, dehydration is an important step after noodles are made because water can offer a hospitable environment for microorganisms. Depending on dehydration methods, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has regulation on moisture content of instant noodles: for instant noodles dehydrated by frying, moisture content cannot exceed 8%, and for those dehydrated by methods other than frying, moisture content cannot exceed 14.5%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Salt ===\nSalt is added when making the flour dough to strengthen gluten structures and enhance the sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is to slow down the activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because [[flavonoid]] pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese [[ramen]], this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.<ref name=\":0\" /> One pack of ramen contains well over half the daily recommended amount of sodium.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/ramen-facts-you-did-not-know|title=7 Fast Facts About Instant Ramen|date=2015-04-02|work=Spoon University|accessdate=2017-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Kansui ===\nKansui, an alkaline solution consisting usually of a 9:1 ratio of sodium carbonate to potassium carbonate, is added to the flour and water when making ramen to help develop several of its unique characteristics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Asian noodles : science, technology, and processing|others=Hou, Gary G.|isbn=9780470179222|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=907642187|last1=Hou|first1=Gary G.|date=26 October 2010}}</ref> The addition of kansui aids in the gluten development of the noodle as well as promotion of gelatinization of starches, both of which contribute to the springiness and chewiness characteristic of ramen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Man|last2=Sun|first2=Qing-Jie|last3=Han|first3=Chuan-Wu|last4=Chen|first4=Hai-Hua|last5=Tang|first5=Wen-Ting|title=Comparative study of the quality characteristics of fresh noodles with regular salt and alkali and the underlying mechanisms|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=246|pages=335\u2013342|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.020|pmid=29291858|year=2018}}</ref> Additionally, the addition of kansui enhances the yellow color of ramen noodles by bringing about [[Chromophore|chromophoric]] shift of several compounds called [[flavonoid]]s that are native to wheat flour.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Oil ===\n[[Frying]] is a common dehydration process for producing instant noodles. Therefore, oil becomes an important component of instant noodles. According to USDA regulation, oil-fried instant noodles should not have fat content higher than 20% of total weight, which means theoretically, the amount of oil uptake during frying process could go even higher. [[Palm oil]] is always chosen as the frying oil for instant noodles due to its heat stability and low cost. However, overall, due to the high-fat content and low moisture content, instant noodles are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation, and relatively high amount of preservatives are added. Hence, to avoid the generation of off-flavours and health-risking compounds, some instant noodles were dehydrated by ways other than frying to reduce the fat content. According to USDA, un-fried instant noodles should have fat content lower than 3%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Starches ===\nPotato starches are commonly added in instant noodles to enhance gelling properties and water-holding capacities of noodles. Gelling properties could enhance the elasticity and chewiness of instant noodles, and water holding capacities could improve the smooth and shiny look of noodles after cooking and shorten the cooking time.\n\n=== Polyphosphates ===\n[[Polyphosphate]] is used in instant noodles as additive to improve [[starch gelatinization]] during cooking (rehydration) to allow more water retention in the noodles. Normally 0.1% of flour weight phosphate compounds are added to water before mixing and making the dough.\n\n=== Hydrocolloids ===\nHydrocolloids such as guar gum are widely used in instant noodles production to enhance water binding capacity during rehydration and shorten the cooking time. Gums are dispersed in water before mixing and making noodles dough.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gulia|first=Neelam|last2=Dhaka|first2=Vandana|last3=Khatkar|first3=B.

There are variations to the ingredients used depending on the country of origin in terms of the salt content and the flour content.\n\nNoodle production starts with dissolving the salt, starch, and flavoring in water to form a mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left for a period of time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop [[gluten]] more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow-paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, they are ready to be steamed for 1\u20135 minutes at {{convert|100|C}} to improve its texture by [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinizing]] the starch of the noodles. When steaming, the addition of water and heat breaks up the helix structure and crystallinity of amylose. Amylose begins to diffuse out of the starch granule and forms a gel matrix around the granule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xteiARU46SQC&dq=food+chemistry+book|title=Food Chemistry|last=Belitz|first=H.-D.|last2=Grosch|first2=Werner|last3=Schieberle|first3=Peter|date=2009-01-15|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783540699330|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Drying ===\nNext, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1\u20132 minutes at a temperature of {{convert|140|\u2013|160|C}}. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30\u201350% to 2\u20135%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of [[Canola oil|canola]], [[Cottonseed oil|cottonseed]] and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30\u201340 minutes in hot air at a temperature of {{convert|70|\u2013|90|C}}, resulting in a moisture content of 8\u201312%. During the drying process, the rapid evaporation of water creates pores throughout the food matrix, which allows for short cooking times in the finished product. In the case of fried noodles, the creation of pores is directly related to the uptake of fat into the noodles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellema|first=M.|title=Mechanism and reduction of fat uptake in deep-fat fried foods|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|volume=14|issue=9|pages=364\u2013373|doi=10.1016/s0924-2244(03)00050-5|year=2003}}</ref> More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15\u201320% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Packaging ===\nBefore packaging with seasoning, the noodles are cooled after drying, and their quality of moisture, color, and shape are checked. Packaging of the noodles include films impermeable to air and water. There are two forms of packaged instant noodles, one in a bag with the provided seasoning in small sachets inside, or [[Cup noodle|in a cup]] with seasoning on the top of the noodles. There are a variety of flavors to the noodles depending on which ones are added to the seasoning. Such flavors include beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, oriental, etc. In [[Cup noodle|instant noodle cups]], soy protein and dehydrated vegetables and meats are often added for further flavor.\n\nThe shelf life of instant noodles ranges from 4\u201312 months, depending on environmental factors. Their stability comes from the high sodium content with low moisture, and low water activity. Instant noodles can be served after 1\u20132 minutes in boiled water or soaked in hot water for 3\u20134 minutes.<ref>USAID. ''Fortification Basis.

After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll slitters. The conveyor belt which transports the noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of the blades on the slitters; therefore, the sheet could be pressed multiple times up and down to produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, the sheets undergo steaming and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of the noodles.\n\n=== Elasticity ===\nAlthough dry instant noodles may not appear elastic, cooked instant noodles generally have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, giving the noodle strands spring-like qualities. The wavy form of the noodles is created when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due to the difference between the velocities of the conveyor belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, creating the unique wavy form of instant noodles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Binxiao|year=2007|title=Asian noodles: History, classification, raw materials, and processing|url=|journal=Food Research International|volume=41|issue=9|pages=888\u2013902|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2007.11.007}}</ref> During pressing by the heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are broken during processing,<ref name=\":0\" /> resulting in more viscoelastic noodle dough and thus more elastic noodles. Furthermore, [[potato starch]], a key ingredient in instant noodles, has the important characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling.<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, the addition of starch could further increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increases the elasticity of noodle strands, as its dissolved ions strengthen the interaction between gluten structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rombouts|first=Ine|last2=Jansens|first2=Koen J.A.|last3=Lagrain|first3=Bert|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|last5=Zhu|first5=Ke-Xue|title=The impact of salt and alkali on gluten polymerization and quality of fresh wheat noodles|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=60|issue=3|pages=507\u2013513|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2014.09.003|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Short cooking time ===\nThe initial purpose of inventing instant noodles was to shorten the cooking time of conventional noodles. Therefore, a short cooking time could be regarded as the most decisive characteristic of instant noodles. Instant noodles are cooked in boiled water; therefore, enhancing water retention is the major method to shorten cooking time.\n\n[[Starch gelatinization]] is the most important feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch gelatinization, which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch gelatinization occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, [[amylose]]s leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the gelatinization of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and gelatinization continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch gelatinization. Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, as a common additive, [[guar gum]] can not only increase the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouthfeel, it can also increase the water binding ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.\n\n== Health and safety concerns ==\n===Nutritional value===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 2.JPG|thumb|A serving of [[Indomie Mi goreng]], with [[fried egg]] and vegetables.

North Korean visitors to China also frequently purchase South Korean ramyeon from Chinese stores, where Shin Ramyeon is known as \"Korean Tangmi Ramyeon.\"\n\nIndigenous production of Ramyeon in North Korea began in 2000. The first Ramyeon brand was \"kkoburang guksu,\" which literally means \"curly noodles\" in Korean. Later, a joint venture by North Korean and Hong Kong-based companies began producing \"j\u016dks\u014fk guksu,\" ({{lang-ko|\uc989\uc11d \uad6d\uc218, \u537d\u5e2d \uad6d\uc218}}) which literally means \"instant noodles.\" Ramy\u014fn is popular among North Korean [[elite]]s who live in Pyongyang and [[Nampo]].

The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as \"yum Mama\". This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Another method is to [[stir fry]] the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are also sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real dehydrated meat such as pork or beef. The average retail price is about six baht for the regular size<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" /> and 10 baht for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFor years, sales of MAMA noodles was considered a barometer of the Thai economy, with consumption rising when times were lean. This has not been the case recently. In 2014, when the political crisis slowed Thailand's economic growth to 0.9 percent and eventually led to a military coup, the growth of MAMA noodle sales hit a low of one percent. In 2015, when the military government could not lift the country beyond an estimated 2.8 percent growth, sales of MAMA noodles only grew 0.4 percent\u2014a record low. Saha Pathanapibul's vice-president, Vathit Chokwatana, attributed the poor sales to falling commodity prices, which have weakened the purchasing power of rural people.<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" />\n\n===United Kingdom===\nA common form of instant noodles in Britain is [[Pot Noodle]], a [[cup noodle]] first marketed by [[Golden Wonder]] in the late 1970s, and acquired by [[Unilever]] in 1995. These use artificial flavorings and are generally suitable for [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] (there is no chicken in Chicken Pot Noodles, for example) and are sold by virtually every major supermarket chain, general groceries shops, and convenience stores.\n\nPacket noodles such as [[Batchelors]]' [[Super Noodles]] are also sold. Several of the larger supermarkets sell eastern brands such as [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], [[Koka noodles]] and [[Shin Ramyun]], which once could only be found in Asian groceries. Larger retail chains may offer their own brand in basic packaging and a variety of flavors, e.g., [[Asda]], while noodles such as [[Maggi]] can also be found in many groceries, but are less widespread. [[Kabuto Noodles]], launched in 2010, was the UKs first up-market instant noodle brand <ref>{{cite news|author=Rebecca Burn-Callander, Enterprise Editor |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/14/meet-the-british-firm-selling-pot-noodles-to-china/ |title=Meet the British firm selling pot noodles to China |date=2016-05-14 |accessdate=2017-07-04|newspaper=The Telegraph }}</ref> followed by Itsu and [[Mr Lee's Noodles]].<ref name=\"BP-20190603\" />\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, instant noodles were first available by [[Nissin Foods]] in 1971. In 1972, Nissin Foods introduced \"Nissin [[Cup Noodles]]\" in a [[foam food container|foam food cup]], which led to an upsurge in popularity. Soon after, many other competing companies were offering similar instant noodle products.\n\n{{anchor|Oodles of Noodles}}Today, in the U.S., the instant noodle is commonly known as ''ramen'', after [[Ramen|the Japanese dish]] on which it was originally based, and it comes in a variety of mostly meat-based flavors such as [[beef]], [[chicken]] and [[shrimp]]. Some prominent brands are [[Nissin Foods]] brand [[Top Ramen]] (originally Top Ramen's Oodles of Noodles), [[Maruchan]] Ramen, and [[Sapporo Ichiban]]. A wide range of popular brands imported from other countries are available at many Asian grocery stores and some supermarkets. Instant ramen noodles are extremely popular among students and other people of low income, due to their ease of preparation, versatility, and unusually low cost. While price varies throughout the U.S., generally several packages can be purchased for 25 cents or less.\n\nIn the [[Incarceration in the United States|prison system]], ramen packets have become a form of [[currency]], comprising a mainstay of the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] there.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why ramen is so valuable in prison |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLt9fRYT92M |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Instant-noodle-isle-2007.jpg|thumb|The instant noodle aisle in a supermarket at the Saigon Tax Trade Center, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]]\n\nInstant noodles are popular in Vietnam, where they are often eaten as a breakfast food.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997.

He is also known as one of the \"Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty\" (\u6f22\u521d\u4e09\u5091), along with [[Han Xin]] (\u97d3\u4fe1) and [[Xiao He]]. Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the establishment of the Han dynasty. After his death, he was honoured with the [[Posthumous name|posthumous title]] \"Marquis Wencheng\" by [[Emperor Qianshao of Han|Emperor Qianshao]].\n\n==Early life==\nZhang Liang was born in Xinzheng{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} (\u65b0\u912d; present-day [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]), the capital of the [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n state]](\u97d3\u570b), while his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] was in Chengfu (\u57ce\u7236; present-day Chengfu Town, [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]). He descended from an aristocrat family in H\u00e1n. His grandfather served three generations of the H\u00e1n rulers as [[Chancellor of China|chancellor]]s while his father served two generations. Zhang Liang missed the opportunity to inherit his family's legacy as the H\u00e1n state was annexed by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] in 230 BC as part of [[Qin's wars of unification]].\n\n==Becoming a Fugitive==\n\n===Assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang===\nTo avenge the fall of his native state, Zhang Liang dedicated his efforts to [[hitman|hiring assassins]] to kill the Qin emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]]. He spent his entire family fortune and failed to give his deceased younger brother a proper funeral. He managed to find a man with great physical strength to help him, and had an iron hammer weighing 120 ancient [[Catty|catties]] (roughly 160&nbsp;lbs. or 72&nbsp;kg) forged for the strongman. In 218 BC, Zhang Liang heard that Qin Shi Huang was going to Yangwu County (east of present-day [[Yuanyang County, Henan|Yuanyang County]], [[Henan]]) as part of his inspection tour, and was due to pass by Bolangsha during the journey.\n\nZhang Liang and the strongman lay in ambush at Bolangsha and waited for the emperor's convoy to approach. They saw that all the carriages that passed by were pulled by four horses<ref>According to the rites of the Qin dynasty, only the emperor's carriage would be pulled by six horses. The carriages of the emperor's subjects would be pulled by four horses. Zhang Liang was aware of that and he confirmed that the carriage pulled by six horses was the one carrying the emperor.</ref> and believed that the most decorated one in the middle was the emperor's carriage. The strongman hurled the hammer towards it and the heavy projectile crushed the carriage, killing its occupant. Zhang Liang fled from the scene during the ensuing chaos. Qin Shi Huang was actually not in that carriage and survived the assassination attempt, after which he ordered the arrest of Zhang Liang. Zhang Liang eluded the dragnet for ten days by using fake identities and becoming a fugitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.0-news.info/history/zhang-liang-ju-sha-qin-shi-huang-wei-sui/ |title=\u5f35\u826f\u72d9\u6bba\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u672a\u9042\uff0c\u9019\u4ef6\u4e8b\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7591\u9ede\uff1a\u5009\u6d77\u541b\u548c\u5927\u529b\u58eb\u53eb\u5565\u540d\uff1f  |url=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Meeting Huang Shigong===\n[[File:Zhangliang and Huangshigong.JPG|thumb|300px|An illustration of Zhang Liang putting Huang Shigong's shoe back on at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing.]]\nAs a wanted man by the government, Zhang Liang travelled to [[Xiapi]] and stayed there for some time, using fake identities to evade the authorities. One day, Zhang Liang took a stroll at Yishui Bridge and met an old man there. The man walked towards Zhang Liang and chucked his shoe down the bridge on purpose, after which he yelled at Zhang, \"Hey boy, go down and fetch me my shoe!\" Zhang Liang was astonished and unhappy but obeyed silently. The old man then lifted his foot and ordered Zhang Liang to put on the shoe for him. Zhang Liang was furious but he controlled his temper and meekly obliged. The man did not show any sign of gratitude and walked away laughing.\n\nThe old man came back after walking a distance and praised Zhang Liang, \"This child can be taught!\"<ref>(\u5b7a\u5b50\u53ef\u6559\u77e3!)</ref> and asked Zhang Liang to meet him at the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, \"How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!\" Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, \"You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I'm the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng.\"\n\nThe old man was Huang Shigong (\u9ec3\u77f3\u516c; lit. \"Yellow Rock Old Man\") . The book was titled ''The Art of War by Taigong'' (\u592a\u516c\u5175\u6cd5) and believed to be the ''[[Six Secret Teachings]]'' by [[Jiang Ziya]], while some called it ''[[Three Strategies of Huang Shigong]]''. In legend, Zhang Liang returned to the indicated site 13 years later and did see a yellow rock there. He built a shrine to worship the rock and the rock was buried with him after his death.\n\n==Rebelling against the Qin dynasty==\nIn 209 BC, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], several uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Many of these rebel forces claimed to be restoring the former states that were annexed by Qin two decades ago. Zhang Liang rallied about 100 men to start a rebellion as well, but his force was too weak, so he led his followers to join [[Jing Ju]], a pretender to the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. He met [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] during his journey and was impressed with Liu's charisma that he changed his decision and joined Liu instead. Zhang Liang became a temporary advisor to Liu Bang and followed Liu to join [[Xiang Liang]]'s rebel force.\n\nThe following year, Xiang Liang installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Mi Xin]] as King Huai II of Chu after eliminating Jing Ju. Zhang Liang's main goal was to reestablish his native state of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]], so he managed to persuade Xiang Liang to do the same for the H\u00e1n state. [[Han Cheng]], a descendant of the royal family of H\u00e1n, was enthroned as King of H\u00e1n, while Zhang Liang was appointed as the H\u00e1n's chancellor. Han Cheng's armies attempted to capture Qin cities that were formerly H\u00e1n territories but did not achieve much success and engaged in guerrilla warfare for about a year. Later that year, Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao and King Huai II put [[Xiang Yu]] (Xiang Liang's nephew) and Liu Bang each in charge of an army to attack Qin, promising that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (heartland of Qin) first would be conferred the title of \"King of Guanzhong\".\n\nIn 207 BC, the combined forces of Liu Bang and Han Cheng conquered Yangzhai (present-day [[Yuzhou City]], [[Henan]]), the former capital of the H\u00e1n state. Han Cheng stayed behind to defend Yangzhai, while Zhang Liang served as a temporary advisor to Liu Bang. Zhang Liang contributed to Liu Bang's eventual victory in the race to Guanzhong for the strategies he proposed. For example, at the battle of Yao Pass, Zhang Liang suggested tricking the Qin commander into surrendering by bribing him with gifts. Liu Bang wanted to accept the surrendered Qin troops into his army but Zhang Liang cautioned him, saying that some of the troops were unwilling to surrender even though their commander agreed. That night, Liu Bang's forces caught the Qin army off guard and scored a major victory. In another incident, Zhang Liang warned Liu Bang against making a detour at Wancheng, because they would be at risk of being surrounded by the enemy if Liu did so.\n\n==Chu\u2013Han Contention==\n{{main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n\nUpon entering the [[Epang Palace]] in [[Xianyang]] (the Qin capital), Liu Bang was strongly tempted by the riches it housed and wanted to stay there forever. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang about overindulgence in sensual pleasures and Liu ordered his men to seal the treasures and move to Bashang to wait for Xiang Yu and the other rebel forces to arrive. During this period of time, Liu Bang heeded Zhang Liang's advice and governed Guanzhong with benevolence, restoring peace and stability, and forbidding his men from pillaging the cities and harming the common people.\n\nIn 206 BC, Xiang Yu's army arrived at [[Hangu Pass]] (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered his men to prevent Xiang's forces from entering Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by [[Fan Zeng]] and a defector from Liu's side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang was shocked and fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the [[Feast at Hong Gate]] hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang's suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Liang left the tent to find [[Fan Kuai]] to save Liu Bang. Following Zhang Liang's instructions, Fan Kuai burst in and openly chided Xiang Yu, making a speech about Liu Bang's accomplishments and affirming that Liu had no intention of opposing Xiang Yu. Liu Bang left the banquet later on the pretext of going to the latrine and was received by [[Xiahou Ying]], who had been waiting nearby on Zhang Liang's instruction. Zhang Liang remained behind to hold Xiang Yu's attention while Liu Bang escaped. Before leaving, Zhang Liang presented Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng with a pair of jade pieces.\n\n===Eighteen Kingdoms===\n{{Main|Eighteen Kingdoms}}\n\nXiang Yu split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]] later, granting the land of [[Guanzhong]] to [[Three Qins|three surrendered Qin generals]], even though Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) instead and granted the title of \"King of [[Han Dynasty|Han]]\". [[Han Cheng]] retained his rulership as King of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]] and Zhang Liang was moved from Liu Bang's side back to H\u00e1n to continue serving as chancellor. Before parting ways, Liu Bang presented Zhang Liang with some gold and pearls, all of which Zhang gave to [[Xiang Bo]]. Zhang Liang also urged Liu Bang to destroy the [[gallery road]]s leading to Bashu during the journey to Hanzhong, in order to reduce Xiang Yu's suspicions that Liu was planning to return and challenge him.\n\nAlthough Han Cheng was the king of H\u00e1n, Xiang Yu did not permit him to govern his kingdom and forced him to accompany him back to his [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]]'s capital of Pengcheng (present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). Han Cheng was demoted to \"Marquis of Rang\" later and killed on Xiang Yu's orders. Xiang Yu seized Han Cheng's kingdom and made his subordinate [[Zheng Chang]] the new King of H\u00e1n. Zhang Liang was still the chancellor of H\u00e1n under the new arrangement but he was aware of his precarious position, and cognisant of how Xiang Yu had destroyed his hope of restoring the H\u00e1n state. Zhang Liang fled from H\u00e1n later and returned to join Liu Bang in the winter of 206 BC. Liu Bang conferred on Zhang Liang the title of \"Marquis of Chengxin\" and Zhang became a permanent advisor to Liu from that time.\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin and Battle of Pengcheng===\nStarting in 206 BC, after Liu Bang's forces conquered the [[Three Qins]], Liu Bang and Xiang Yu engaged in a four-year-long power struggle for supremacy over China, historically known as the Chu\u2013Han Contention. In 205 BC, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Pengcheng]] and he retreated to Xiayi. Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the \"Xiayi Plan\" (\u4e0b\u9091\u4e4b\u8b00). Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice: he sent [[Xiao He]] to persuade Ying Bu to join him; contacted Peng Yue and allied with him; and allowed Han Xin to lead part of his army to attack other territories on the northern front.\n\nIn 204 BC, Liu Bang was trapped by Xiang Yu in [[Xingyang]] and both sides reached a stalemate. [[Li Yiji]] suggested to Liu Bang to recreate the former states of the [[Warring States period]] and install the descendants of their royal families on their respective thrones. This plan was intended to help Liu Bang gain the support of the vassal states' rulers, who would help him in the war against Xiang Yu. However, Zhang Liang disapproved of the plan as he felt that the states were more likely to support [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]] instead as Chu was superior to Han in terms of military might. Liu Bang realised the problem and immediately dismissed Li Yiji's plan.\n\nIn 203 BC, after his victory at the [[Battle of Wei River]], Han Xin conquered the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] and sent a messenger to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu appoint him as the acting King of Qi. Liu was still trapped at Xingyang then and he was furious after hearing the request because he was expecting Han Xin to come to his aid. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang that if he refused to approve Han Xin's request, Han might be discontented and declare independence from Liu, putting them in a dangerous situation. Liu Bang reluctantly agreed and sent Zhang Liang to pass the king's seal to Han Xin. Zhang Liang met Han Xin and succeeded in reaffirming Han's loyalty to Liu Bang.\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nBy late 203 BC, Zhang Liang saw that the tide had turned in favour of Liu Bang, as Xiang Yu had been surrounded on three sides. Together with [[Chen Ping (Han Dynasty)|Chen Ping]], Zhang Liang suggested to Liu Bang to renounce the Treaty of Hong Canal and use the opportunity to eliminate Western Chu. However, at the Battle of Guling, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu because the expected reinforcements from Han Xin and Peng Yue did not arrive. Zhang Liang explained to Liu Bang that Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops because they did not have their fiefs yet, even though they had received their titles of vassal kings. Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice and granted lands to Han Xin and Peng Yue. Two months later, as Zhang Liang predicted, Han Xin and Peng Yue arrived with their armies and formed a coordinated attack on Western Chu together with Liu Bang's force, defeating Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] in 202 BC.\n\n==In service during the Han dynasty==\nIn 202 BC, after his victory over Xiang Yu, Liu Bang ascended the throne and became historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu of Han\". Following the establishment of the [[Han dynasty]], Zhang Liang remained as a key advisor to Gaozu even though he did not receive any formal appointment as a government minister. Together with Lou Jing, Zhang Liang later suggested for Gaozu to build his capital in [[Chang'an]] instead of [[Luoyang]], as Chang'an was in a more strategic position than Luoyang (fertile land and surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes). Once, Gaozu noticed that some of his subjects were having a secret discussion and he asked for Zhang Liang's opinion. Zhang Liang told Gaozu that they were plotting a rebellion and Gaozu was shocked. Zhang Liang proceeded to ask Gaozu whom of all his subjects he hated the most. Gaozu mentioned [[Yong Chi]], who had rebelled against him before but surrendered later. Zhang Liang then suggested to Gaozu to grant Yong Chi a noble title, because if the others saw that Gaozu was able to forgive Yong Chi, they would be at ease and would not think of rebelling.\n\nSubsequently, Zhang Liang retired from state affairs and practised [[Taoism]]. In late 201 BC, Gaozu rewarded his subjects who contributed to the dynasty's founding and he conferred the title of \"Marquis of Liu\" on Zhang Liang. In 196 BC, Gaozu left to suppress a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], and requested Zhang Liang to come out of retirement to assist the crown prince, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], in governing the home territories. After returning from the campaign, Gaozu wanted to replace Liu Ying with [[Liu Ruyi]], the Prince of Zhao. Zhang Liang opposed Gaozu's decision but Gaozu ignored him so Zhang feigned illness and retired again. When approached by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] to help Liu Ying retain his position, Zhang Liang recommended the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]] to help Liu Ying, and the four men succeeded in convincing Gaozu to keep Liu Ying as the crown prince. Zhang Liang remained in retirement until his death in 186 BC.\n\n==Death and burial place==\n[[File:\u5f20\u5bb6\u754c\u5f20\u826f\u5893.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Zhang Liang Tomb in [[Zhangjiajie]], [[Hunan]].]]\n\nLittle is known about Zhang Liang's later life, hence his final resting place has been a mystery throughout history.\n\nA Zhang Liang Tomb stands at 6&nbsp;km southwest of present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]. According to legend, during the [[L\u00fc Clan Disturbance]], Zhang Liang moved to Mount Baiyun at the southwest of Donghun County (present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]), and was buried there after his death. A Zhang Liang Temple used to stand beside the tomb, but it was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nAnother Zhang Liang Tomb stands at south of [[Weishan County, Shandong|Weishan County]], [[Shandong]]. The stone tablet in front of the grave bearing Zhang Liang's name was erected in 1737 during the [[Qing dynasty]]. A Zhang Liang Shrine also used to stand east of the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHowever, some believed that Zhang Liang's tomb was in present-day [[Pei County]], [[Xuzhou]]. According to the 7th-century gazetteer ''[[Kuodi Zhi]]'', Zhang Liang's tomb was 65 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of Pei County, near Liucheng, where a Zhang Liang Temple was also located.\n\nAccording to ''Xianshizhi'' (\u4ed9\u91cb\u5fd7) and ''Lingmuzhi'' (\u9675\u5893\u5fd7), Zhang Liang's tomb was at Mount Qingyan in [[Hunan]].\n\n==Modern references==\nAn article in ''Xianzhuan Shiyi'' (\u4ed9\u50b3\u62fe\u907a) tells the story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal.<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\">{{in lang|zh}} [http://mag.epochtimes.com/b5/016/2939.htm \u5f20\u826f \u4fee\u70bc\u6210\u4ed9\u7684\u6545\u4e8b] (''The story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal'')</ref> Zhang Liang practised some of the book's teachings and attained some magical powers. Zhang Liang was buried at Dragon Head Plains (\u9f8d\u9996\u539f) after his death. In legend, Zhang Liang's tomb was raided when the [[Chimei|Red Brows Army]] revolted, and the robbers saw a yellow stone pillow inside his tomb. The pillow transformed swiftly and flew away like a shooting star, and nothing else was found in the tomb, not even Zhang Liang's body. Zhang Liang became an immortal and served [[Laozi]] as an assistant. Zhang Liang's grandson, [[Zhang Daoling]], became an immortal, too, and he went with his grandfather to meet the [[Queen Mother of the West]] on [[Mount Kunlun]].<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\" />\n\nZhang Liang's encounter with Huang Shigong had also become one of the classic Chinese folk tales about humility for later generations to learn from.\n\nZhang Liang is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI]]'' by [[Koei]]. He has higher intelligence stats than all these characters, except for [[Jiang Ziya]]. Zhang Liang is also a playable character of the \"Wizard\" class in the action RPG ''[[Prince of Qin (video game)|Prince of Qin]]''.\n\nHe also appears as a character in the animation series ''[[The Legend of Qin (animated TV series)|The Legend of Qin]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Zhang Liang}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Sima Qian]].

He is also known as one of the \"Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty\" (\u6f22\u521d\u4e09\u5091), along with [[Han Xin]] (\u97d3\u4fe1) and [[Xiao He]]. Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the establishment of the Han dynasty. After his death, he was honoured with the [[Posthumous name|posthumous title]] \"Marquis Wencheng\" by [[Emperor Qianshao of Han|Emperor Qianshao]].\n\n==Early life==\nZhang Liang was born in Xinzheng{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} (\u65b0\u912d; present-day [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]), the capital of the [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n state]](\u97d3\u570b), while his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] was in Chengfu (\u57ce\u7236; present-day Chengfu Town, [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]). He descended from an aristocrat family in H\u00e1n. His grandfather served three generations of the H\u00e1n rulers as [[Chancellor of China|chancellor]]s while his father served two generations. Zhang Liang missed the opportunity to inherit his family's legacy as the H\u00e1n state was annexed by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] in 230 BC as part of [[Qin's wars of unification]].\n\n==Becoming a Fugitive==\n\n===Assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang===\nTo avenge the fall of his native state, Zhang Liang dedicated his efforts to [[hitman|hiring assassins]] to kill the Qin emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]]. He spent his entire family fortune and failed to give his deceased younger brother a proper funeral. He managed to find a man with great physical strength to help him, and had an iron hammer weighing 120 ancient [[Catty|catties]] (roughly 160&nbsp;lbs. or 72&nbsp;kg) forged for the strongman. In 218 BC, Zhang Liang heard that Qin Shi Huang was going to Yangwu County (east of present-day [[Yuanyang County, Henan|Yuanyang County]], [[Henan]]) as part of his inspection tour, and was due to pass by Bolangsha during the journey.\n\nZhang Liang and the strongman lay in ambush at Bolangsha and waited for the emperor's convoy to approach. They saw that all the carriages that passed by were pulled by four horses<ref>According to the rites of the Qin dynasty, only the emperor's carriage would be pulled by six horses. The carriages of the emperor's subjects would be pulled by four horses. Zhang Liang was aware of that and he confirmed that the carriage pulled by six horses was the one carrying the emperor.</ref> and believed that the most decorated one in the middle was the emperor's carriage. The strongman hurled the hammer towards it and the heavy projectile crushed the carriage, killing its occupant. Zhang Liang fled from the scene during the ensuing chaos. Qin Shi Huang was actually not in that carriage and survived the assassination attempt, after which he ordered the arrest of Zhang Liang. Zhang Liang eluded the dragnet for ten days by using fake identities and becoming a fugitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.0-news.info/history/zhang-liang-ju-sha-qin-shi-huang-wei-sui/ |title=\u5f35\u826f\u72d9\u6bba\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u672a\u9042\uff0c\u9019\u4ef6\u4e8b\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7591\u9ede  |website=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Meeting Huang Shigong===\n[[File:Zhangliang and Huangshigong.JPG|thumb|300px|An illustration of Zhang Liang putting Huang Shigong's shoe back on at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing.]]\nAs a wanted man by the government, Zhang Liang travelled to [[Xiapi]] and stayed there for some time, using fake identities to evade the authorities. One day, Zhang Liang took a stroll at Yishui Bridge and met an old man there. The man walked towards Zhang Liang and chucked his shoe down the bridge on purpose, after which he yelled at Zhang, \"Hey boy, go down and fetch me my shoe!\" Zhang Liang was astonished and unhappy but obeyed silently. The old man then lifted his foot and ordered Zhang Liang to put on the shoe for him. Zhang Liang was furious but he controlled his temper and meekly obliged. The man did not show any sign of gratitude and walked away laughing.\n\nThe old man came back after walking a distance and praised Zhang Liang, \"This child can be taught!\"<ref>(\u5b7a\u5b50\u53ef\u6559\u77e3!)</ref> and asked Zhang Liang to meet him at the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, \"How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!\" Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, \"You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I'm the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng.\"\n\nThe old man was Huang Shigong (\u9ec3\u77f3\u516c; lit. \"Yellow Rock Old Man\") . The book was titled ''The Art of War by Taigong'' (\u592a\u516c\u5175\u6cd5) and believed to be the ''[[Six Secret Teachings]]'' by [[Jiang Ziya]], while some called it ''[[Three Strategies of Huang Shigong]]''. In legend, Zhang Liang returned to the indicated site 13 years later and did see a yellow rock there. He built a shrine to worship the rock and the rock was buried with him after his death.\n\n==Rebelling against the Qin dynasty==\nIn 209 BC, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], several uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Many of these rebel forces claimed to be restoring the former states that were annexed by Qin two decades ago. Zhang Liang rallied about 100 men to start a rebellion as well, but his force was too weak, so he led his followers to join [[Jing Ju]], a pretender to the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. He met [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] during his journey and was impressed with Liu's charisma that he changed his decision and joined Liu instead. Zhang Liang became a temporary advisor to Liu Bang and followed Liu to join [[Xiang Liang]]'s rebel force.\n\nThe following year, Xiang Liang installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Mi Xin]] as King Huai II of Chu after eliminating Jing Ju. Zhang Liang's main goal was to reestablish his native state of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]], so he managed to persuade Xiang Liang to do the same for the H\u00e1n state. [[Han Cheng]], a descendant of the royal family of H\u00e1n, was enthroned as King of H\u00e1n, while Zhang Liang was appointed as the H\u00e1n's chancellor. Han Cheng's armies attempted to capture Qin cities that were formerly H\u00e1n territories but did not achieve much success and engaged in guerrilla warfare for about a year. Later that year, Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao and King Huai II put [[Xiang Yu]] (Xiang Liang's nephew) and Liu Bang each in charge of an army to attack Qin, promising that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (heartland of Qin) first would be conferred the title of \"King of Guanzhong\".\n\nIn 207 BC, the combined forces of Liu Bang and Han Cheng conquered Yangzhai (present-day [[Yuzhou City]], [[Henan]]), the former capital of the H\u00e1n state. Han Cheng stayed behind to defend Yangzhai, while Zhang Liang served as a temporary advisor to Liu Bang. Zhang Liang contributed to Liu Bang's eventual victory in the race to Guanzhong for the strategies he proposed. For example, at the battle of Yao Pass, Zhang Liang suggested tricking the Qin commander into surrendering by bribing him with gifts. Liu Bang wanted to accept the surrendered Qin troops into his army but Zhang Liang cautioned him, saying that some of the troops were unwilling to surrender even though their commander agreed. That night, Liu Bang's forces caught the Qin army off guard and scored a major victory. In another incident, Zhang Liang warned Liu Bang against making a detour at Wancheng, because they would be at risk of being surrounded by the enemy if Liu did so.\n\n==Chu\u2013Han Contention==\n{{main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n\nUpon entering the [[Epang Palace]] in [[Xianyang]] (the Qin capital), Liu Bang was strongly tempted by the riches it housed and wanted to stay there forever. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang about overindulgence in sensual pleasures and Liu ordered his men to seal the treasures and move to Bashang to wait for Xiang Yu and the other rebel forces to arrive. During this period of time, Liu Bang heeded Zhang Liang's advice and governed Guanzhong with benevolence, restoring peace and stability, and forbidding his men from pillaging the cities and harming the common people.\n\nIn 206 BC, Xiang Yu's army arrived at [[Hangu Pass]] (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered his men to prevent Xiang's forces from entering Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by [[Fan Zeng]] and a defector from Liu's side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang was shocked and fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the [[Feast at Hong Gate]] hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang's suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Liang left the tent to find [[Fan Kuai]] to save Liu Bang. Following Zhang Liang's instructions, Fan Kuai burst in and openly chided Xiang Yu, making a speech about Liu Bang's accomplishments and affirming that Liu had no intention of opposing Xiang Yu. Liu Bang left the banquet later on the pretext of going to the latrine and was received by [[Xiahou Ying]], who had been waiting nearby on Zhang Liang's instruction. Zhang Liang remained behind to hold Xiang Yu's attention while Liu Bang escaped. Before leaving, Zhang Liang presented Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng with a pair of jade pieces.\n\n===Eighteen Kingdoms===\n{{Main|Eighteen Kingdoms}}\n\nXiang Yu split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]] later, granting the land of [[Guanzhong]] to [[Three Qins|three surrendered Qin generals]], even though Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) instead and granted the title of \"King of [[Han Dynasty|Han]]\". [[Han Cheng]] retained his rulership as King of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]] and Zhang Liang was moved from Liu Bang's side back to H\u00e1n to continue serving as chancellor. Before parting ways, Liu Bang presented Zhang Liang with some gold and pearls, all of which Zhang gave to [[Xiang Bo]]. Zhang Liang also urged Liu Bang to destroy the [[gallery road]]s leading to Bashu during the journey to Hanzhong, in order to reduce Xiang Yu's suspicions that Liu was planning to return and challenge him.\n\nAlthough Han Cheng was the king of H\u00e1n, Xiang Yu did not permit him to govern his kingdom and forced him to accompany him back to his [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]]'s capital of Pengcheng (present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). Han Cheng was demoted to \"Marquis of Rang\" later and killed on Xiang Yu's orders. Xiang Yu seized Han Cheng's kingdom and made his subordinate [[Zheng Chang]] the new King of H\u00e1n. Zhang Liang was still the chancellor of H\u00e1n under the new arrangement but he was aware of his precarious position, and cognisant of how Xiang Yu had destroyed his hope of restoring the H\u00e1n state.

Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the \"Xiayi Plan\" (\u4e0b\u9091\u4e4b\u8b00). Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice: he sent [[Xiao He]] to persuade Ying Bu to join him; contacted Peng Yue and allied with him; and allowed Han Xin to lead part of his army to attack other territories on the northern front.\n\nIn 204 BC, Liu Bang was trapped by Xiang Yu in [[Xingyang]] and both sides reached a stalemate.

Following the establishment of the [[Han dynasty]], Zhang Liang remained as a key advisor to Gaozu even though he did not receive any formal appointment as a government minister. Together with Lou Jing, Zhang Liang later suggested for Gaozu to build his capital in [[Chang'an]] instead of [[Luoyang]], as Chang'an was in a more strategic position than Luoyang (fertile land and surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes).

Zhang Liang then suggested to Gaozu to grant Yong Chi a noble title, because if the others saw that Gaozu was able to forgive Yong Chi, they would be at ease and would not think of rebelling.\n\nSubsequently, Zhang Liang retired from state affairs and practised [[Taoism]]. In late 201 BC, Gaozu rewarded his subjects who contributed to the dynasty's founding and he conferred the title of \"Marquis of Liu\" on Zhang Liang. In 196 BC, Gaozu left to suppress a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], and requested Zhang Liang to come out of retirement to assist the crown prince, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], in governing the home territories. After returning from the campaign, Gaozu wanted to replace Liu Ying with [[Liu Ruyi]], the Prince of Zhao. Zhang Liang opposed Gaozu's decision but Gaozu ignored him so Zhang feigned illness and retired again. When approached by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] to help Liu Ying retain his position, Zhang Liang recommended the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]] to help Liu Ying, and the four men succeeded in convincing Gaozu to keep Liu Ying as the crown prince. Zhang Liang remained in retirement until his death in 186 BC.\n\n==Death and burial place==\n[[File:\u5f20\u5bb6\u754c\u5f20\u826f\u5893.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Zhang Liang Tomb in [[Zhangjiajie]], [[Hunan]].]]\n\nLittle is known about Zhang Liang's later life, hence his final resting place has been a mystery throughout history.\n\nA Zhang Liang Tomb stands at 6&nbsp;km southwest of present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]. According to legend, during the [[L\u00fc Clan Disturbance]], Zhang Liang moved to Mount Baiyun at the southwest of Donghun County (present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]), and was buried there after his death. A Zhang Liang Temple used to stand beside the tomb, but it was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nAnother Zhang Liang Tomb stands at south of [[Weishan County, Shandong|Weishan County]], [[Shandong]]. The stone tablet in front of the grave bearing Zhang Liang's name was erected in 1737 during the [[Qing dynasty]]. A Zhang Liang Shrine also used to stand east of the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHowever, some believed that Zhang Liang's tomb was in present-day [[Pei County]], [[Xuzhou]]. According to the 7th-century gazetteer ''[[Kuodi Zhi]]'', Zhang Liang's tomb was 65 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of Pei County, near Liucheng, where a Zhang Liang Temple was also located.\n\nAccording to ''Xianshizhi'' (\u4ed9\u91cb\u5fd7) and ''Lingmuzhi'' (\u9675\u5893\u5fd7), Zhang Liang's tomb was at Mount Qingyan in [[Hunan]].\n\n==Modern references==\nAn article in ''Xianzhuan Shiyi'' (\u4ed9\u50b3\u62fe\u907a) tells the story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal.<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\">{{in lang|zh}} [http://mag.epochtimes.com/b5/016/2939.htm \u5f20\u826f \u4fee\u70bc\u6210\u4ed9\u7684\u6545\u4e8b] (''The story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal'')</ref> Zhang Liang practised some of the book's teachings and attained some magical powers. Zhang Liang was buried at Dragon Head Plains (\u9f8d\u9996\u539f) after his death. In legend, Zhang Liang's tomb was raided when the [[Chimei|Red Brows Army]] revolted, and the robbers saw a yellow stone pillow inside his tomb. The pillow transformed swiftly and flew away like a shooting star, and nothing else was found in the tomb, not even Zhang Liang's body. Zhang Liang became an immortal and served [[Laozi]] as an assistant. Zhang Liang's grandson, [[Zhang Daoling]], became an immortal, too, and he went with his grandfather to meet the [[Queen Mother of the West]] on [[Mount Kunlun]].<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\" />\n\nZhang Liang's encounter with Huang Shigong had also become one of the classic Chinese folk tales about humility for later generations to learn from.\n\nZhang Liang is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI]]'' by [[Koei]]. He has higher intelligence stats than all these characters, except for [[Jiang Ziya]]. Zhang Liang is also a playable character of the \"Wizard\" class in the action RPG ''[[Prince of Qin (video game)|Prince of Qin]]''.\n\nHe also appears as a character in the animation series ''[[The Legend of Qin (animated TV series)|The Legend of Qin]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Zhang Liang}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Sima Qian]].
