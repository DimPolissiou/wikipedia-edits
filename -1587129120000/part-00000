To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

When Principal Morse crossed the street from the school and confronted Frederick about the banner, he asked \"What about the Bill of Rights and freedom of speech?\" She told him to take the banner down because she \"felt that it violated the policy against displaying offensive material, including material that advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs\", and she grabbed it from him and crumpled it up.<ref>''Frederick v.

Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No.'\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}. The Court, in holding (contra the District Court) that ''[[Tinker v.

Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v.

Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No.&nbsp;92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.

Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would&nbsp;... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]]. Qualified immunity is an [[affirmative defense]] that requires courts to enter judgment in favor of a government employee accused of violating individual rights unless the employee's conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref> Because it was not clear whether the school principal's actions in taking down the banner violated the First Amendment, Breyer would have simply issued a narrow decision indicating that she was shielded by qualified immunity and gone no further.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 425-26 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a dissent joined by Justice [[David Souter|Souter]] and Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], argued that \"the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding\u2014indeed, lauding\u2014a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 435 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens wrote:\n\n{{quote|... the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech 'reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use' ... cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs. The First Amendment demands more, indeed, much more.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 434 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>}}\n\nStevens criticized the majority decision as one that \"trivializes the two cardinal principles upon which ''Tinker'' rests\", because it \"upholds a punishment meted out on the basis of a listener's disagreement with her understanding (or, more likely, misunderstanding) of the speaker's viewpoint\".<ref name=SJ5>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Moreover, he noted, \"Encouraging drug use might well increase the likelihood that a listener will try an illegal drug, but that hardly justifies censorship\".<ref name=SJ5/> \"[C]arving out pro-drug speech for uniquely harsh treatment finds no support in our case law and is inimical to the values protected by the First Amendment.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 438-39 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nStevens also took issue with the majority's interpretation of the banner as being a serious incitement to drug use:\n\n{{quote|Admittedly, some high school students (including those who use drugs) are dumb.

However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech. See, e.g., Hilden, supra note 12 (discussing ''Wisniewski v. Bd. of Educ. of Weedsport Cent. Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 34 (2d Cir. 2007)); see also infra text accompanying note 17 (providing further discussion of ''Wisniewski'', in which the Second Circuit cited to Morse, but applied Tinker).\n\n==Groups involved==\nThe [[American Civil Liberties Union]] directly participated in this case on the side of Joseph Frederick.

To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No.'\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}.

Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v.

Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the class room: we are light years away from that.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 59, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No.&nbsp;92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls]]''.<!-- this content isn\u2019t appropriate for this article; I am preserving it so I can move it to a new article on school speech.\n* \"while children assuredly do not 'shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate,' ... the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school.\"<ref>Here, Roberts cited to:<br />''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]], 655\u2013656 (1995) (quoting ''Tinker'','' supra,'' at 506)</ref> ([[Fourth Amendment]])\n* \"the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.\"<ref>Here, Roberts cited to:<br />''[[New Jersey v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would&nbsp;... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]]. Qualified immunity is an [[affirmative defense]] that requires courts to enter judgment in favor of a government employee accused of violating individual rights unless the employee's conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref> Because it was not clear whether the school principal's actions in taking down the banner violated the First Amendment, Breyer would have simply issued a narrow decision indicating that she was shielded by qualified immunity and gone no further.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 425-26 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a dissent joined by Justice [[David Souter|Souter]] and Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], argued that \"the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding\u2014indeed, lauding\u2014a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 435 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens wrote:\n\n{{quote|... the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech 'reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use' ... cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs. The First Amendment demands more, indeed, much more.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 434 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>}}\n\nStevens criticized the majority decision as one that \"trivializes the two cardinal principles upon which ''Tinker'' rests\", because it \"upholds a punishment meted out on the basis of a listener's disagreement with her understanding (or, more likely, misunderstanding) of the speaker's viewpoint\".<ref name=SJ5>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Moreover, he noted, \"Encouraging drug use might well increase the likelihood that a listener will try an illegal drug, but that hardly justifies censorship\".<ref name=SJ5/> \"[C]arving out pro-drug speech for uniquely harsh treatment finds no support in our case law and is inimical to the values protected by the First Amendment.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 438-39 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nStevens also took issue with the majority's interpretation of the banner as being a serious incitement to drug use:\n\n{{quote|Admittedly, some high school students (including those who use drugs) are dumb. Most students, however, do not shed their brains at the schoolhouse gate, and most students know dumb advocacy when they see it. The notion that the message on this banner would actually persuade either the average student or even the dumbest one to change his or her behavior is most implausible.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 444 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>}}\n\nStevens argued that it would be \"profoundly unwise to create special rules for speech about drug and alcohol use\", pointing to the historical examples of both opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and resistance to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in the 1920s.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 446-47 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Pointing to the current debate over [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]], Stevens concluded, \"Surely our national experience with alcohol should make us wary of dampening speech suggesting\u2014however inarticulately\u2014that it would be better to tax and regulate marijuana than to persevere in a futile effort to ban its use entirely.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\n==Academic commentary{{anchor|Commentary}}==\n\n=== Melinda Cupps Dickler ===\nMelinda Cupps Dickler, in her article \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\" in the ''[[Loyola Law Review]]'',<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> provided a survey of commentary that followed in the immediate aftermath of the case: Some commentators have suggested that Morse both demonstrated a division among the Justices on student speech rights<ref>See, e.g., Linda Greenhouse, \"Vote Against Banner Shows Divide on Speech in Schools\", ''The New York Times'', June&nbsp;26, 2007, at A18, available at 2007 WLNR 12010165 (describing the Court as \"deeply split\").</ref> and continued Fraser's and Kuhlmeier's erosion of students' First Amendment rights.<ref>\nFor example, compare: ''National Review Online'', A Bong Hit to Free Speech, Posting of David French to Phi Beta Cons, https://web.archive.org/web/20110805202813/http://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/44149/bong-hit-free-speech (June&nbsp;25, 2007, 12:19&nbsp;P.M.

He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

The resistosome seems to have a high affinity for the [[cell membrane|cellular membrane]].

The [[genes]] of both the sensor and the respective helper NLR are usually paired in the [[genome]] and their [[Protein expression (disambiguation)|expression]] could be controlled by the same [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]].

The [[genes]] of both the sensor and the respective helper NLR are usually paired in the [[genome]] and their [[Protein expression (disambiguation)|expression]] could be controlled by the same [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]].
