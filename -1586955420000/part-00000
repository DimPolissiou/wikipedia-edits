[[Henri Rougier]] driving his Turcat-M\u00e9ry 45-hp finished 11th overall, and 9th in the heavy car class]]\n\nAt the time in France there was a great interest in international car races. In 1894 the [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris\u2013Rouen]] was the first car race in the world, followed by races from Paris to [[Paris\u2013Bordeaux\u2013Paris|Bordeaux]], [[Marseilles]], [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]].\n\n==The organisation==\n===Problems in getting authorizations===\nThe French government was against the idea of races being held on public streets. After the Paris\u2013Berlin race of 1901, the Minister of Internal Affairs M. [[Waldeck-Rousseau]] stated that no other races would be authorized.\nThe Paris\u2013[[Madrid]] was strongly supported by King [[Alphonse XIII of Spain]], and French media suggested that France could not withdraw from the competition, being the country with the most advanced technology in car manufacturing.\n\n[[Etienne van Zuylen van Nyevelt|Baron de Zuylen]], president of the [[Automobile Club de France|ACF]], managed to overcome the opposition of Prime Minister [[\u00c9mile Combes]] by stating that the roads were indeed public, the public wanted the races, and many local administrators were eager to have a race pass through their towns.\n\nMany French car manufacturers supported the request, employing of over 25 thousand workers and producing 16 million [[Francs]] per year of export alone. Since races were necessary to promote the [[brand]]s, they interceded with the government who finally agreed with the race. The [[Council of Ministries]] and the President gave their support to the race on February 17, 1903, while the ACF had been accepting applications since January 15.\n\n===The setup===\nIn just 40 days over 300 drivers enrolled, many more than expected. The net worth of the cars involved in the race surpassed 7 million Francs.\n\nThe race was to span over 1307 kilometers, in three legs: [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] \u2013 Bordeaux (552&nbsp;km), Bordeaux \u2013 [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]] (km 335) and Vitoria \u2013 Madrid (420&nbsp;km). The rules were published in the three biggest motor sport magazines of France: [[France Automobile]], [[La Locomotion]], [[La Vie Automobile]].\n\nThe rules called for four weight categories: less than 250&nbsp;kg, 250 to 400&nbsp;kg, 400 to 650&nbsp;kg and 650 to 1000&nbsp;kg. The weight was intended as [[dry weight]], excluding the driver, fuel, batteries, oil, spare parts, tools, food and water, driver's luggage, headlights and lights harnesses, horns and eventual external starter.\n\nThe subscription cost ranged from 50 to 400 Francs, depending on weight. The two heaviest classes were supposed to have a driver and a mechanic (weighing no less than 60&nbsp;kg, the same for the whole race), while the two lighter ones required only a driver.\n\nThe starting order was drawn at random between the cars enrolled in the first thirty days, and in progression for the drivers enrolled after February 15. The race start was established for the 3.30 AM of Sunday May 24, from Versailles Gardens, les Jardins de Versailles. As in many races before, the cars were to leave one by one, with a two-minute delay.\n\nThe \"Absolutely Closed Parks\" rule was introduced: at the end each race leg, the cars were to be taken by a commissioner to [[Parc ferm\u00e9|closed pens]], where no repairs or maintenance were allowed. Any refueling or repairs had to be done during the race time. While in transit to the pens, the cars had to cross the towns in parade, accompanied by a race officer on a bicycle who was supposed to record the exact time of the crossing, which was later deducted from the overall driver's time. The time records were written on time slips and kept in sealed metal boxes on every car.\n\nWhile Versailles \u2013 Bordeaux was a mainstay of road races (the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett Cup]] has been kept there in 1901), the Bordeaux \u2013 Vitoria leg presented more uncertainty: it was full of sharp turns, climbs, narrow bridges, rail crossings, stone roads and long, paved stretches where high speeds would be possible.\n\n===The participants===\n315 racers enrolled, but only 224 were present on the start line, subdivided as follows:\n* 88 cars in the heaviest class (650 to 1000&nbsp;kg)\n* 49 cars between 400 and 650&nbsp;kg\n* 33 ''voiturettes'' under 400&nbsp;kg\n* 54 motorcycles\n\nMany famous racers and brands joined the race.\n[[Ren\u00e9 de Knyff]], [[Henri Farman|Henri]] and [[Maurice Farman]], [[Pierre de Crawhez]], [[Charles S. Rolls]] were racing with [[Panhard-Levassor]], mighty 4-cylinders cars capable of 70&nbsp;hp and 130&nbsp;km/h\n\n[[Henri Fournier]], [[William K. Vanderbilt]], [[Fernand Gabriel]] and [[Baron de Forest]] enrolled for the [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]] brand, who presented a daring new wind-splitting radiator on the classic ''bateau'' frames. The car was very powerful, with 90&nbsp;hp and a maximum speed of almost 140&nbsp;km/h\n\n[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] deployed 11 cars, ranging from 60 to 90&nbsp;hp. [[De Dietrich]] and many other French brands such as [[Gobron Billi\u00e8]], [[Napier & Son|Napier]] and [[Charron Girardot]] shunned the lightest classes and raced only with their most powerful and heavy models. The smallest cars from those brands were still present in the hands of amateurs and private racers. Other French brands included [[Automobiles Darracq France|Darracq]], [[De Dion-Bouton]], [[Cl\u00e9ment-Bayard]], [[Richard (car)|Richard]], and [[D\u00e9cauville]].\n\n[[Renault]] joined the race with two cars driven by [[Marcel Renault]] and [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], two founders of the brand and experienced drivers.\n\nItalian manufacturer [[Fiat]] presented only two cars, but could count on two of the best drivers of the time, [[Vincenzo Lancia]] and [[Luigi Storero]].\n\n===The public===\nFrench newspapers were excited and covered the race with great enthusiasm. The race was presented as the biggest race since the invention of the car, and over 100,000 people managed to reach Versailles at 2 am for the race start. The first hundred of kilometers of the race track were crowded with spectators, and rail stations were swarmed with people trying to reach Versailles.\n\nThe crowd and the darkness convinced the organisers to delay the race start by half an hour, and to reduce the delay between cars to just one minute. The day was expected to be very hot, and the officials wanted to avoid the heat of the late morning.\n\n==The race==\n===Start line and first checkpoint===\n[[File:Marcel Renault 1903.jpg|thumb|The car from [[Marcel Renault]]]]\n[[File:Fernand Gabriel Mors Paris-Madrid 1903.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Fernand Gabriel]], with his [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]].]]\n\nThe starting point was in front of the Eau des Suisses at the [[gardens of Versailles]]. In the early morning of May 24, 1903, participants started at one minute intervals for the first leg to Bordeaux via [[Saint-Cyr-l'\u00c9cole|Saint Cyr]], [[Trappes]], [[Coigni\u00e8res]], [[Le Perray-en-Yvelines|Le Perray]], [[Rambouillet]], [[Chartres]], [[Clayes]], [[Tours]], [[Ruffec, Charente|Ruffec]], [[Angoul\u00eame]], [[Chevanceaux]], [[Guitres]], [[Libourne]]. The first car was expected to arrive at Bordeaux around noon.<ref>[[The New York Herald]], May 24, 1903, front page. Reproduced in {{cite book | title=The Front Page | isbn=2-9507220-0-8 | year=1992 | page=20}}</ref>\n\nThe soldiers deployed to manage the crowd proved insufficient, and people swarmed the streets. The first racer to leave, Charles Jarrott with his mechanic Bianchi in a 1000&nbsp;kg, 45&nbsp;hp De Dietrich, tried to slow down to 40 miles per hour, to give people time to evacuate the road in front of the car, but it only worsened the problem since people just waited longer to move away.\n\nDe Knyff on his [[Panhard-Levassor]] left second, followed by Louis Renault in a 650&nbsp;kg, 30 cv Renault. Th\u00e9ry in D\u00e9cauville (640&nbsp;kg, 24 cv), another De Di\u00e9trich, a Mors, a Panhard and a light Passy Thellier, (400&nbsp;kg, 16 cv) were the next. The start took until 6.45 a.m., almost three hours.\n\nThe race proved to be very difficult for the drivers: the dangers from the crowd added to the thick dust cloud raised by the cars. The weather had been dry for the prior two weeks, and dust covered the roads. Officials watered down just the first kilometer of road, and the short delay between cars worsened the problem. Visibility dropped to few meters, and people stood in the middle of the road to see the cars, becoming a persistent danger for the drivers.\n\nAfter the first control point in [[Rambouillet]], and the second in [[Chartres]] the crowd became less dense. Just after Rambouillet, Louis Renault's wild racing style allowed him to overcome both De Knyff and Jarrott, who were struggling for first place but keeping a more prudent stance to avoid the crowd. Thery and Stead followed at distance, while Jenatzy's Mercedes and Gabriel's Mors were leading an incredible recovery, surpassing 25 cars and achieving a spot in the first ten drivers.\n\nAnother incredible feat was achieved by [[Marcel Renault]], who started in the 60th position but managed to almost reach the race leaders at the control point of [[Poitiers]].\n\nOutside of the leading positions, the accidents continued throughout the day; cars hit trees and disintegrated, they overturned and caught fire, axles broke and inexperienced drivers crashed on the rough roads.\n\n===The finishing line===\nLouis Renault reached Bordeaux in first place at noon, while Jarrott, who was racing with a defective clutch and was troubled by mechanical problems to the engine and exhaust, arrived half an hour later followed by Gabriel, Salleron, Baras, de Crawhez, Warden, Rougier, Jenatzy and Voigt. All the drivers were physically exhausted: the cars were heavy, and required a great deal of force to maneuver. Dust made their eyes sore, and many of them had had issues with the engines and burned their hands while fixing them. Gabriel, who left as 168th and arrived third, was later recognized as the winner when the time slips were tallied up.\n\nA few big names had to withdraw, and news slowly started coming to the finishing line. Vanderbilt broke a cylinder on his Mors, and had to leave the race. Baron de Caters's Mercedes hit a tree, but was unhurt and probably was fixing the car to keep racing.\nLady race car driver [[Camille du Gast]] (Crespin) was placed as high as 8th in her 30&nbsp;hp [[De Dietrich]] until she stopped to help fellow driver [[E. T. Stead]] (Phil Stead) who had crashed. She finished 45th. [[Charles Jarrott (racing driver)|Charles Jarrott]], who finished fourth overall with his de Dietrich, asserted that Stead would have died if she had not stopped.<ref name=\"Historic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=387922934524 |title=Historic Racing, 225 - Camille du Gast, the first woman to race at international level.

This later was found to be false.\n\nSomeone started talking about an accident involving [[Marcel Renault]]; with his incredibly fast pace he should have already arrived by that time, but was still missing. News arrived stating that he had an accident at [[Couh\u00e9|Couh\u00e9 V\u00e9rac]]. He would die 48 hours later, never regaining consciousness.\nThere is a memorial at the place where his accident occurred on the [[Route nationale 10|RN 10]] road in the [[Poitou-Charentes]] region of France. This monument was destroyed by the Germans during World War II.\n\nPorter's Wolseley was destroyed at a rail crossing where the bar was unexpectedly down. The car hit it and overturned, killing his mechanic. Georges Richard hit a tree in Angoul\u00eame, trying to avoid a farmer standing in the middle of the road, and news came that in [[Ch\u00e2tellerault]] Tourand's Brunhot had hit spectators while avoiding a child who crossed the road.  A soldier named Dupuy intervened and saved the child, but was killed and the car lost control, killing a spectator.\n[[File:1903 Paris-Madrid - Henri B\u00e9connais (Darracq 40hp) dnf.jpg|thumb|right|220px|{{ill|Henri B\u00e9connais|fr}} with his [[Automobiles Darracq France|Darracq]]]] \nFurther south, another car left the road and went into a group of spectators.  Two people were said to be killed in the crowd.\n\nE.T. Stead, (Phil Stead) in the massive De Dietrich, lost control while overtaking another car in [[Saint-Pierre-du-Palais]], and was injured. He was rescued and tended to by the only lady competitor [[Camille du Gast]]. The third De Dietrich driven by Loraine Barrow crashed into a tree and was said to have blown up, wounding the driver and killing the mechanic. Barrow had been in bad health before the race, but had to leave nevertheless since the rules forbade a driver change.<ref name=\"Historic\"/>\n\nRolls's Panhard-Levassor, Mayhew's Napier, Maurice Farman's Panhard, the Wolseleys of Herbert Austin and Sidney Girling, B\u00e9connais's Darracq all had major technical issues, and had to retire.\n\nOverall, half the cars had crashed or retired, and at least twelve people were presumed dead, and over 100 wounded. The actual count was lower, with eight people dead, three spectators and five racers.\n\n==The aftermath==\n===The race is cancelled===\nThe French Parliament reacted strongly to the news of the numerous accidents. An emergency Council of Ministers was called, and the officers were forced to shut down the race in Bordeaux, transfer the cars to Spanish territory and restart from the border to Madrid. The Spanish government denied permission for this, and the race was declared officially over in Bordeaux.\n\nThe race was called off, and by order of the French Government the cars were impounded and towed to the rail station by horses and transported to Paris by train. (The cars' engines were not even allowed to be restarted.<ref>[http://www.grandprixhistory.org/story.htm Grand Prix History online] (retrieved 11 June 2017); {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200415123756/http://www.grandprixhistory.org/story.htm#|date=April 15, 2020|title=Archive}}</ref>)\n\nNewspapers and experts declared the \"death of sport racing\". It was commonly thought that no other races would be allowed, and for many years this was true: there would not be another race on public highways until the 1927 ''[[Mille Miglia]]''.\n\nThe effects of the race extended to automobile regulations. Motions to outlaw speeding by car at over {{convert|40|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} were proposed, some calling for the ban to be enforced in races, too.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Public opinion is mixed===\nWhile some newspapers, such as ''Le Temps'', used the disaster in a demagogic way to attack the car fashion and the race world, other (such as ''la Presse'') tried to downplay the issue, stating that just 3 \"involuntary\" victims, the spectators, had been sacrificed on the \"altar of Progress\".\n\n''La Libert\u00e9'' rejected the call for a ban on sport races, since automobile manufacturing was a source of French pride, and the socialist ''Petite Republique'' defended the car as a mean of mass empowerment and freedom from work fatigue.\n\n''Le Matin'' supported the opinion first stated by the Marquis de Dion, that speed races were useless, both as a publicity stunt and as testbed for technological improvement. The only useful races were the endurance and fuel efficiency ones. There was a bit of truth in the opinion that race cars had very little in common with common commercial cars, with their oversized engines and extreme solutions.\n\nA specialized magazine, ''L'Auto'', tried to reach consensus on a new set of rules for sport races; fewer drivers and cars, classes based on speed and power (not just weight), and the public placed far away from the race course.\n\n===Inquiry on the causes===\nThe first fair and authoritative analysis came from ''La Locomotion Automobile'', which identified the causes of the disaster. The massacre was due to a few concurrent factors:\n* Speed. Cars raced at over 140&nbsp;km/h, a speed not reached even by the fastest trains of the time.\n* Dust, which worsened the driving conditions and was direct cause of a few accidents.\n* Excessive and poorly managed public, worsened by an inadequate crowd control and a general underestimation of the danger involved in a car race.\n\nThe police force was accused of being more interested in the race than the public safety, forgetting to intervene when people crossed the road or stood in it. The organization was held responsible for poor choices. The random start order was a mess, since faster and more powerful cars were mixed with slower and smaller ones, causing many unneeded overtakings. Some drivers (such as Mouter in the De Dietrich) managed to advance almost 80 places, just because they started far back and had many small cars and amateur drivers ahead. The interval between starts was reduced to one minute only, worsening the dust problem and randomly mixing in motorcycles, ''[[voiturette]]s'' and race cars.\n\nThe rule preventing a driver change before the race start was also under scrutiny. Some drivers, it was said including Marcel Renault, had health problems at the start line but had to race because the brands could not retire a vehicle, and no driver change was possible.\n\n===Causes of accidents===\nThe London's weekly magazine ''The Car'' verified the death claims, discovering that some of them were only rumours, and investigated the actual causes.\n\nIn the Angoul\u00eame accident killing the soldier and a spectator, it was discovered that the child was at fault, having crossed the road after escaping his parents.\n\nThe accident at the rail cross that occurred to Porter was a fault of the organization, since the cross was not attended. The leading hypothesis about a loss of control due to a mechanical failure was dismissed.\n\nBarrow's car did not blow up, it hit a dog while avoiding another one and crashed into a tree, but did not explode or burn. The idea of an engine exploding had great appeal to the public, but was a product of ignorance and hype.\n\nMarcel Renault's and Stead's accidents were the only true racing incidents, and were both due to the excessive dust impairing visibility during an overtaking. The blame was put on the officers and the rules, and the death toll was deemed surprisingly low given those premises.\n\n===Political consequences===\nFrench Prime Minister [[\u00c9mile Combes]], was accused of being partially responsible, because he agreed to allow the race to proceed. He tried to explain that he did not know cars could be so fast and dangerous.\nHe claimed to be against any restriction on the automotive makers, and both Parliament and Senate agreed with a formal vote in support of his decision.\n\nJust a few days after the disaster, the newspapers lost interest in the Paris\u2013Madrid race. The sport pages were all about another race, at the Ardennes racetrack the following June 22.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Commons category|Paris-Madrid race}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191349/http://www.virtualcar.it/%C2%ABparigi-madrid-1903-una-corsa-che-non-ebbe-arrivo%C2%BB-di-donatella-biffignandi/ Donatella Biffignandi: \"Parigi-Madrid 1903.

Visibility dropped to few meters, and people stood in the middle of the road to see the cars, becoming a persistent danger for the drivers.\n\nAfter the first control point in [[Rambouillet]], and the second in [[Chartres]] the crowd became less dense. Just after Rambouillet, Louis Renault's wild racing style allowed him to overcome both De Knyff and Jarrott, who were struggling for first place but keeping a more prudent stance to avoid the crowd. Thery and Stead followed at distance, while Jenatzy's Mercedes and Gabriel's Mors were leading an incredible recovery, surpassing 25 cars and achieving a spot in the first ten drivers.\n\nAnother incredible feat was achieved by [[Marcel Renault]], who started in the 60th position but managed to almost reach the race leaders at the control point of [[Poitiers]].\n\nOutside of the leading positions, the accidents continued throughout the day; cars hit trees and disintegrated, they overturned and caught fire, axles broke and inexperienced drivers crashed on the rough roads.\n\n===The finishing line===\nLouis Renault reached Bordeaux in first place at noon, while Jarrott, who was racing with a defective clutch and was troubled by mechanical problems to the engine and exhaust, arrived half an hour later followed by Gabriel, Salleron, Baras, de Crawhez, Warden, Rougier, Jenatzy and Voigt. All the drivers were physically exhausted: the cars were heavy, and required a great deal of force to maneuver. Dust made their eyes sore, and many of them had had issues with the engines and burned their hands while fixing them. Gabriel, who left as 168th and arrived third, was later recognized as the winner when the time slips were tallied up.\n\nA few big names had to withdraw, and news slowly started coming to the finishing line. Vanderbilt broke a cylinder on his Mors, and had to leave the race. Baron de Caters's Mercedes hit a tree, but was unhurt and probably was fixing the car to keep racing.\nLady race car driver [[Camille du Gast]] (Crespin) was placed as high as 8th in her 30&nbsp;hp [[De Dietrich]] until she stopped to help fellow driver [[E. T. Stead]] (Phil Stead) who had crashed. She finished 45th. [[Charles Jarrott (racing driver)|Charles Jarrott]], who finished fourth overall with his de Dietrich, asserted that Stead would have died if she had not stopped.<ref name=\"Historic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=387922934524 |title=Historic Racing, 225 - Camille du Gast, the first woman to race at international level.

This later was found to be false.\n\nSomeone started talking about an accident involving [[Marcel Renault]]; with his incredibly fast pace he should have already arrived by that time, but was still missing. News arrived stating that he had an accident at [[Couh\u00e9|Couh\u00e9 V\u00e9rac]]. He would die 48 hours later, never regaining consciousness.\nThere is a memorial at the place where his accident occurred on the [[Route nationale 10|RN 10]] road in the [[Poitou-Charentes]] region of France. This monument was destroyed by the Germans during World War II.\n\nPorter's Wolseley was destroyed at a rail crossing where the bar was unexpectedly down. The car hit it and overturned, killing his mechanic. Georges Richard hit a tree in Angoul\u00eame, trying to avoid a farmer standing in the middle of the road, and news came that in [[Ch\u00e2tellerault]] Tourand's Brunhot had hit spectators while avoiding a child who crossed the road.  A soldier named Dupuy intervened and saved the child, but was killed and the car lost control, killing a spectator.\n[[File:1903 Paris-Madrid - Henri B\u00e9connais (Darracq 40hp) dnf.jpg|thumb|right|220px|{{ill|Henri B\u00e9connais|fr}} with his [[Automobiles Darracq France|Darracq]]]] \nFurther south, another car left the road and went into a group of spectators.  Two people were said to be killed in the crowd.\n\nE.T. Stead, (Phil Stead) in the massive De Dietrich, lost control while overtaking another car in [[Saint-Pierre-du-Palais]], and was injured. He was rescued and tended to by the only lady competitor [[Camille du Gast]]. The third De Dietrich driven by Loraine Barrow crashed into a tree and was said to have blown up, wounding the driver and killing the mechanic. Barrow had been in bad health before the race, but had to leave nevertheless since the rules forbade a driver change.<ref name=\"Historic\"/>\n\nRolls's Panhard-Levassor, Mayhew's Napier, Maurice Farman's Panhard, the Wolseleys of Herbert Austin and Sidney Girling, B\u00e9connais's Darracq all had major technical issues, and had to retire.\n\nOverall, half the cars had crashed or retired, and at least twelve people were presumed dead, and over 100 wounded. The actual count was lower, with eight people dead, three spectators and five racers.\n\n==The aftermath==\n===The race is cancelled===\nThe French Parliament reacted strongly to the news of the numerous accidents. An emergency Council of Ministers was called, and the officers were forced to shut down the race in Bordeaux, transfer the cars to Spanish territory and restart from the border to Madrid. The Spanish government denied permission for this, and the race was declared officially over in Bordeaux.\n\nThe race was called off, and by order of the French Government the cars were impounded and towed to the rail station by horses and transported to Paris by train. (The cars' engines were not even allowed to be restarted.<ref>[http://www.grandprixhistory.org/story.htm Grand Prix History online] (retrieved 11 June 2017)</ref>)\n\nNewspapers and experts declared the \"death of sport racing\". It was commonly thought that no other races would be allowed, and for many years this was true: there would not be another race on public highways until the 1927 ''[[Mille Miglia]]''.\n\nThe effects of the race extended to automobile regulations. Motions to outlaw speeding by car at over {{convert|40|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} were proposed, some calling for the ban to be enforced in races, too.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Public opinion is mixed===\nWhile some newspapers, such as ''Le Temps'', used the disaster in a demagogic way to attack the car fashion and the race world, other (such as ''la Presse'') tried to downplay the issue, stating that just 3 \"involuntary\" victims, the spectators, had been sacrificed on the \"altar of Progress\".\n\n''La Libert\u00e9'' rejected the call for a ban on sport races, since automobile manufacturing was a source of French pride, and the socialist ''Petite Republique'' defended the car as a mean of mass empowerment and freedom from work fatigue.\n\n''Le Matin'' supported the opinion first stated by the Marquis de Dion, that speed races were useless, both as a publicity stunt and as testbed for technological improvement. The only useful races were the endurance and fuel efficiency ones. There was a bit of truth in the opinion that race cars had very little in common with common commercial cars, with their oversized engines and extreme solutions.\n\nA specialized magazine, ''L'Auto'', tried to reach consensus on a new set of rules for sport races; fewer drivers and cars, classes based on speed and power (not just weight), and the public placed far away from the race course.\n\n===Inquiry on the causes===\nThe first fair and authoritative analysis came from ''La Locomotion Automobile'', which identified the causes of the disaster. The massacre was due to a few concurrent factors:\n* Speed. Cars raced at over 140&nbsp;km/h, a speed not reached even by the fastest trains of the time.\n* Dust, which worsened the driving conditions and was direct cause of a few accidents.\n* Excessive and poorly managed public, worsened by an inadequate crowd control and a general underestimation of the danger involved in a car race.\n\nThe police force was accused of being more interested in the race than the public safety, forgetting to intervene when people crossed the road or stood in it. The organization was held responsible for poor choices. The random start order was a mess, since faster and more powerful cars were mixed with slower and smaller ones, causing many unneeded overtakings. Some drivers (such as Mouter in the De Dietrich) managed to advance almost 80 places, just because they started far back and had many small cars and amateur drivers ahead. The interval between starts was reduced to one minute only, worsening the dust problem and randomly mixing in motorcycles, ''[[voiturette]]s'' and race cars.\n\nThe rule preventing a driver change before the race start was also under scrutiny. Some drivers, it was said including Marcel Renault, had health problems at the start line but had to race because the brands could not retire a vehicle, and no driver change was possible.\n\n===Causes of accidents===\nThe London's weekly magazine ''The Car'' verified the death claims, discovering that some of them were only rumours, and investigated the actual causes.\n\nIn the Angoul\u00eame accident killing the soldier and a spectator, it was discovered that the child was at fault, having crossed the road after escaping his parents.\n\nThe accident at the rail cross that occurred to Porter was a fault of the organization, since the cross was not attended. The leading hypothesis about a loss of control due to a mechanical failure was dismissed.\n\nBarrow's car did not blow up, it hit a dog while avoiding another one and crashed into a tree, but did not explode or burn. The idea of an engine exploding had great appeal to the public, but was a product of ignorance and hype.\n\nMarcel Renault's and Stead's accidents were the only true racing incidents, and were both due to the excessive dust impairing visibility during an overtaking. The blame was put on the officers and the rules, and the death toll was deemed surprisingly low given those premises.\n\n===Political consequences===\nFrench Prime Minister [[\u00c9mile Combes]], was accused of being partially responsible, because he agreed to allow the race to proceed. He tried to explain that he did not know cars could be so fast and dangerous.\nHe claimed to be against any restriction on the automotive makers, and both Parliament and Senate agreed with a formal vote in support of his decision.\n\nJust a few days after the disaster, the newspapers lost interest in the Paris\u2013Madrid race. The sport pages were all about another race, at the Ardennes racetrack the following June 22.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Commons category|Paris-Madrid race}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191349/http://www.virtualcar.it/%C2%ABparigi-madrid-1903-una-corsa-che-non-ebbe-arrivo%C2%BB-di-donatella-biffignandi/ Donatella Biffignandi: \"Parigi-Madrid 1903.

To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the [[Alans]].\n\nWhen the [[Huns]] arrived in the European Steppe region in the 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a large part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of [[Attila]]'s forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Other Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the [[Lower Danube]] to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the [[Roman empire]] in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. \n\nThe original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have been an important component of the [[Visigoths]] who formed under [[Alaric I]]. Based upon interpretations of the ''Getica'' by the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are more strongly associated with both the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]], and the later [[Amal dynasty]] who were among Attila's Goths.

Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed, with Greuthingi, Alans and Huns. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] during which the Greuthungi were allied with the Tervingi. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi in the Roman Empire appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]].\n\nThe outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians'' (2005),  183&ndash;185.</ref>\n\nSeveral sources report a last great event in which the Greuthungi went under that name, under a leader from outside the Empire named [[Odotheus]]. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named [[Promotus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=213\u2013216}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nIn time and geographical area, the Greutungi and their neighbours, the Thervingi, correspond to the archaeological [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\n===Settlement pattern===\nChernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''The Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 52-54.</ref>\n\n===Burial practices===\nChernyakhov cemeteries include both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials in which the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools but almost never any weapons.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 54-56.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Ostrogoths==\nThe Tervingi were first attested by 291, indicating that different Gothic peoples already had distinct identities and names by that time.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\">Wolfram, 24.</ref> The Greuthungi are first named by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], writing no earlier than 392 and perhaps later than 395.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> The earliest events where he describes the Grethungi were in the 360s.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}} The Ostrogoths, are also first mentioned in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greutungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|loc=p.24 & p.387 fn52}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}} \n\nDespite such records which seem to show the Ostrogoths and Greutungi as distinct, according to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greutungi or [[Vesi]]/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> When the names were used together, Wolfram argues that it is significant that the pairing was always preserved, as in ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/>\n\nThe nomenclature of Greuthungi and Tervingi fell out of use shortly after 400.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> In general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after it entered the Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> Wolfram believes that because the term Greuthungi was a geographical identifier the terminology dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/><ref name=\"Burns44\">Burns, 44.</ref> In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians north of the Ister.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\">Wolfram, 387 n57.</ref> Wolfram concludes that it was the Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\"/> On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.<ref name=\"Burns44\"/>\n\nThat the Greuthungi were the Ostrogothi is an idea derived from the medieval writer [[Jordanes]].<ref>Heather, 52&ndash;57, 300&ndash;301.</ref> He identified the Ostrogothic kings from [[Theodoric the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungian king [[Ermanaric]]. That interpretation is very common among scholars today, is not universal. [[Peter Heather]] for example has written that the \"Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name\".<ref>{{citation|year=2007|last=Heather |first=Peter|title=Linguistic and Literary Traces of the Ostrogoths, The Ostrogoths from the Migration Period to the Sixth Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|editor-last1=Barnish |editor-last2=Marazzi|series=Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology|volume=7|ref=harv|isbn=9781843830740 |page=404}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n*[[Ermanaric]] ({{circa}} 370s), King\n*[[Vithimiris]] ({{circa}} 376), King\n*[[Alatheus and Saphrax]] ({{floruit}} 376\u2013387), chieftains\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Greuthungi Wall]]\n* [[Thervingi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Germanic peoples}}\n\n[[Category:Goths]]\n[[Category:Ostrogoths]]\n[[Category:History of the North Caucasus]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:History of the western steppe]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Chernyakhov.PNG|right|250px|thumb|\n{{legend|#0f0|[[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|[[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark culture]] in the early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]] in the early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe '''Greuthungs''', '''Greuthungi''', or '''Greutungi''' were a [[Goths|Gothic]] people of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] between the [[Dniester River|Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers, in the 3rd and the 4th centuries.<ref name=\"Heather\">{{cite book |last1=Heather |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Heather |date=2018 |chapter=Greuthungi |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-2131? |editor1-last=Nicholson |editor1-first=Oliver  |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |pages= |isbn=9780191744457 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=January 26, 2020  |ref=}}</ref> \n\nThey had close contacts with the [[Tervingi]], another Gothic people, who lived west of the Dniester River.

Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi in the Roman Empire appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]].\n\nThe outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians'' (2005),  183&ndash;185.</ref>\n\nSeveral sources report a last great event in which the Greuthungi went under that name, under a leader from outside the Empire named [[Odotheus]]. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named [[Promotus]].{{Christensen|2002|pages=213\u2013216}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nIn time and geographical area, the Greutungi and their neighbours, the Thervingi, correspond to the archaeological [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\n===Settlement pattern===\nChernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''The Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 52-54.</ref>\n\n===Burial practices===\nChernyakhov cemeteries include both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials in which the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools but almost never any weapons.<ref>Heather, Peter and Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 54-56.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Ostrogoths==\nThe Tervingi were first attested by 291, indicating that different Gothic peoples already had distinct identities and names by that time.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\">Wolfram, 24.</ref> The Greuthungi are first named by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], writing no earlier than 392 and perhaps later than 395.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> The earliest events where he describes the Grethungi were in the 360s.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}} The Ostrogoths, are also first mentioned in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greutungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|loc=p.24 & p.387 fn52}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}} \n\nDespite such records which seem to show the Ostrogoths and Greutungi as distinct, according to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greutungi or [[Vesi]]/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> When the names were used together, Wolfram argues that it is significant that the pairing was always preserved, as in ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/>\n\nThe nomenclature of Greuthungi and Tervingi fell out of use shortly after 400.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> In general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after it entered the Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> Wolfram believes that because the term Greuthungi was a geographical identifier the terminology dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/><ref name=\"Burns44\">Burns, 44.</ref> In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians north of the Ister.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\">Wolfram, 387 n57.</ref> Wolfram concludes that it was the Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n57\"/> On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.<ref name=\"Burns44\"/>\n\nThat the Greuthungi were the Ostrogothi is an idea derived from the medieval writer [[Jordanes]].<ref>Heather, 52&ndash;57, 300&ndash;301.</ref> He identified the Ostrogothic kings from [[Theodoric the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungian king [[Ermanaric]]. That interpretation is very common among scholars today, is not universal. [[Peter Heather]] for example has written that the \"Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name\".<ref>{{citation|year=2007|last=Heather |first=Peter|title=Linguistic and Literary Traces of the Ostrogoths, The Ostrogoths from the Migration Period to the Sixth Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|editor-last1=Barnish |editor-last2=Marazzi|series=Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology|volume=7|ref=harv|isbn=9781843830740 |page=404}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n*[[Ermanaric]] ({{circa}} 370s), King\n*[[Vithimiris]] ({{circa}} 376), King\n*[[Alatheus and Saphrax]] ({{floruit}} 376\u2013387), chieftains\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Greuthungi Wall]]\n* [[Thervingi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Germanic peoples}}\n\n[[Category:Goths]]\n[[Category:Ostrogoths]]\n[[Category:History of the North Caucasus]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:History of the western steppe]]\n", "name_user": "Andrew Lancaster", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greuthungi"}
