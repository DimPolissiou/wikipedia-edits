This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.\n\nThe pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women's and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are, therefore ,able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

Please don't remove.-->\n\nIn the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced.  Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The \"Spanish style\" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013321</ref>\n\nThough different textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,<ref>Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.</ref> the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were primarily derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of different styles such as the \"Steinkirk\" [[cravat]] or necktie.\n\n[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion.

By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.<ref>James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit</ref>\n\nAlthough tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry indeed led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first authentic ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.<ref>Claire B.

[[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a vast number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.\n\nOne can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)\n\nIn recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their ideas.<ref>Lemire, B., & Riello, G (2008). \"East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe\".

It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century\u2014with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores\u2014clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.\n\nAlthough the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe fashion industry consists of four levels:\n\n# The production of raw materials, principally Fiber ,and textiles but also leather and fur.\n#The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.\n# Retail sales.\n# Various forms of advertising and promotion.\n\nThese levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors.

Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing</ref>\n\n== Fashion trend ==\n{{main|Fashion trend|2010s in fashion}}\nFashion trends influenced by several factors , including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, political, economic , social ,and technological. Examining these factors is called a [[PEST analysis]]. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine the growth or decline of a particular trend.\n\n=== Political influences ===\n[[File:Shinz\u014d Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]\n\nDid not only political events make a Significant impact on fashion trends, but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress ,or a soft color Cassini coat with Large buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s, the economy had become wealthier, the divorce rate was increasing ,and the government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired the younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt became a significant  fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie , and it is still affecting the current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.\n\nDevelopments such as wearable technology have become an essential trend in fashion. They will  continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and [[E-textiles|smart fabrics]] that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apparel.edgl.com/news/Top-6-Tech-Trends-in-the-Fashion-Industry94135|title=Top 6 Tech Trends in the Fashion Industry|last=Communications|first=Edgell|website=apparel.edgl.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nThe fashion industry is seeing how [[3D printing]] technology has influenced designers such as [[Iris van Herpen|Iris Van Herpen]] and [[Kimberly Ovitz]]. These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually, consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely.\n\nInternet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed , and sold immediately.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487\u2013506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|year=2016|url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/examining-hedonic-and-utilitarian-motivations-for-mcommerce-fashion-retail-app-engagement(98defb8e-c227-43b1-824b-9f8b55b61cca).html}}</ref> Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract trendsetters.

The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. The effects can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers, and consumers regarding trends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541091/how-machine-vision-is-about-to-change-the-fashion-world/|title=How Machine Vision Is About to Change the Fashion World|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nMilitary technology has played an essential role in the fashion industry. The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s , and camouflage fabric was introduced to streetwear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com|title=Home : Berg Fashion Library|website=www.bergfashionlibrary.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Designers such as Valentino, Dior , and Dolce & Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections.\n\n=== Social influences ===\n[[File:Britney Europe.jpg|thumb|upright|Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have popularised the concept of wearing [[underwear as outerwear]].]]\n[[File:Gabriel Garko and Laura Torrisi - nicogenin - 66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) - The Road (3).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Red carpet fashion]]: Italian actors [[Gabriel Garko]] and [[Laura Torrisi]] wearing designer [[formal wear]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], 2009]]\n\nFashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music\u2026like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives.\" Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video \u2018Formation\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9, according to Carlos,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyonc\u00e9's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyonc\u00e9 catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day.\"\n\nRunway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway shows are a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet.\" Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like \"Feminist but feminine\" and \"Ladies first.\" According to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\" /> \"The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour.\"\n\n=== Economic influences ===\n\n==== Circular economy ====\nWith increasing environmental awareness, the economic imperative to \"Spend now, think later\" is getting increasingly scrutinized.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&q=economy+trend+fashion&CID=A105052&PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society, and these initiatives are often described as a move towards [[sustainable fashion]], yet critics argue a circular economy based on growth is an oxymoron, or an increasing spiral of consumption, rather than a utopian [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] circular solution.\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes \u2014 easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.\n\nChina is an interesting market for fashion retail as Chinese consumers' motivation to shop for fashion items are unique from Western Audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail?

Chinese high-street shoppers prefer adventure and social shopping, while online shoppers are motived by idea shopping. Another difference is how gratification and idea shopping influence spending over \u00a51k per month on fashion items, and regular spending influenced by value shopping.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg\n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\n\n====Market research====\nConsumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs include key demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\nTo understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do [[market research]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail? Shopping motivations, demographics and spending|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093/full/html|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=158\u2013175|doi=10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093|issn=1361-2026}}</ref>\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n====Symbolic consumption====\nConsumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piacentini |first1=Maria |title=Symbolic consumption in teenagers' clothing choices |journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251-262}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s. The woman is wearing [[backless dress]] with deep slits on its lower portion, while the man is wearing a shirt with top buttons open.]]\n\nThe media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news</ref> In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. Fashion industry utilizes advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. Few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-advertising-24312.html|title=Examples of Traditional Advertising|last=Lauren|first=Lynn|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}</ref> In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.<ref>Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.\n\n=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===\n\n==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====\nThere are some fashion advertisements that were accused of racism and led to boycotts from the customers. Globally known, Swedish fashion brand H&M faced this issue with one of its children's wear advertisements in 2018. A black child wearing a hoodie with a slogan written as \"coolest monkey in the jungle\" right at the center was featured in the ad. When it was released, it immediate became controversial and even led to boycott. A lot of people including celebrities posted on social media about their resentments towards H&M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&M issued a statement saying \"we apologise to anyone this may have offended\", which seemed insincere to some.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/hm-hoodie-racist-boycott-advertising-people-h-m-a8149246.html|title=People are boycotting H&M over 'racist' hoodie|date=2018-01-09|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> \nAnother fashion advertisement regarding racism is from GAP, American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features playful, four young girls where tall white girl is leaning with her arm on a shorter black girl's head. When this ad was released, some viewers harshly criticized that it underlies passive racism. A representative from The Root, black culture magazine commented on the ad that it portrays the message that the black people are undervalued and seen like props for white people to look better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35968787|title=Is this Gap advert racist?|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-10-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> There were different points of views on this issue, some saying that people are being too sensitive, and some getting offended.

British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British mode wearing the brand's boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained lots of backlashes and criticism by the viewers since sexual harassment and misconduct was a huge issue during this time and even till now.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

For men, [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Ice Cube]] have also helped define modern day fashion for black men. Today's fashion scene is not just clothes, but also hair and makeup. Recent trends have included the embracing of natural hair, traditional clothing worn with modern clothing, or traditional patterns used in modern clothing styles. All of these trends come with the long existing and persevering movement of \"Black is Beautiful\".\n\n=== Early American Fashion ===\nIn the mid to end of the 1900s, African American style changed and developed with the times. Around the 1950s is really when the black community was able to create their own distinct styles.

This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.\n\nThe pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women's and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are, therefore ,able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The \"Spanish style\" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013321</ref>\n\nThough different textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,<ref>Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.</ref> the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were primarily derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of different styles such as the \"Steinkirk\" [[cravat]] or necktie.\n\n[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion.

By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.<ref>James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit</ref>\n\nAlthough tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry indeed led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first authentic ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.<ref>Claire B.

[[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a vast number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.\n\nOne can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)\n\nIn recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their ideas.<ref>Lemire, B., & Riello, G (2008). \"East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe\".

It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century\u2014with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores\u2014clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.\n\nAlthough the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe fashion industry consists of four levels:\n\n# The production of raw materials, principally Fiber ,and textiles but also leather and fur.\n#The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.\n# Retail sales.\n# Various forms of advertising and promotion.\n\nThese levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors.

For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress ,or a soft color Cassini coat with Large buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s, the economy had become wealthier, the divorce rate was increasing ,and the government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired the younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt became a significant  fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie , and it is still affecting the current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society.

Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.\n\nDevelopments such as wearable technology have become an essential trend in fashion.

The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s , and camouflage fabric was introduced to streetwear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then.

According to Matika,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music\u2026like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives.\" Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video \u2018Formation\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9, according to Carlos,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyonc\u00e9's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyonc\u00e9 catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once.

For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway shows are a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet.\" Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like \"Feminist but feminine\" and \"Ladies first.\" According to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\" /> \"The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour.\"\n\n=== Economic influences ===\n\n==== Circular economy ====\nWith increasing environmental awareness, the economic imperative to \"Spend now, think later\" is getting increasingly scrutinized.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&q=economy+trend+fashion&CID=A105052&PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society, and these initiatives are often described as a move towards [[sustainable fashion]], yet critics argue a circular economy based on growth is an oxymoron, or an increasing spiral of consumption, rather than a utopian [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] circular solution.\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes \u2014 easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.\n\nChina is an interesting market for fashion retail as Chinese consumers' motivation to shop for fashion items are unique from Western Audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail?

Chinese high-street shoppers prefer adventure and social shopping, while online shoppers are motived by idea shopping. Another difference is how gratification and idea shopping influence spending over \u00a51k per month on fashion items, and regular spending influenced by value shopping.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg\n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\n\n====Market research====\nConsumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs include key demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\nTo understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do [[market research]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail? Shopping motivations, demographics and spending|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093/full/html|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=158\u2013175|doi=10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093|issn=1361-2026}}</ref>\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n====Symbolic consumption====\nConsumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piacentini |first1=Maria |title=Symbolic consumption in teenagers' clothing choices |journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251-262}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s. The woman is wearing [[backless dress]] with deep slits on its lower portion, while the man is wearing a shirt with top buttons open.]]\n\nThe media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news</ref> In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. Fashion industry utilizes advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. Few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-advertising-24312.html|title=Examples of Traditional Advertising|last=Lauren|first=Lynn|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}</ref> In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.<ref>Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.\n\n=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===\n\n==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====\nThere are some fashion advertisements that were accused of racism and led to boycotts from the customers. Globally known, Swedish fashion brand H&M faced this issue with one of its children's wear advertisements in 2018. A black child wearing a hoodie with a slogan written as \"coolest monkey in the jungle\" right at the center was featured in the ad. When it was released, it immediate became controversial and even led to boycott. A lot of people including celebrities posted on social media about their resentments towards H&M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&M issued a statement saying \"we apologise to anyone this may have offended\", which seemed insincere to some.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/hm-hoodie-racist-boycott-advertising-people-h-m-a8149246.html|title=People are boycotting H&M over 'racist' hoodie|date=2018-01-09|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> \nAnother fashion advertisement regarding racism is from GAP, American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features playful, four young girls where tall white girl is leaning with her arm on a shorter black girl's head. When this ad was released, some viewers harshly criticized that it underlies passive racism. A representative from The Root, black culture magazine commented on the ad that it portrays the message that the black people are undervalued and seen like props for white people to look better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35968787|title=Is this Gap advert racist?|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-10-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> There were different points of views on this issue, some saying that people are being too sensitive, and some getting offended.

British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British mode wearing the brand's boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained lots of backlashes and criticism by the viewers since sexual harassment and misconduct was a huge issue during this time and even till now. Many people showed their dismay through social media posts, leading Jimmy Choo to pull down the ad from social media platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/22/jimmy-choo-cara-delevingne-catcall-ad/|title=Jimmy Choo pulls Cara Delevingne ad after online backlash|last=Gallucci|first=Nicole|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\nFrench luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent also faced this issue with its print ad shown in Paris in 2017. A female model is wearing a fishnet tights with roller-skate stilettos, almost lying down with her legs opened in front of the camera. This advertisement brought harsh comments from the viewers and French advertising organization directors for going against the advertising codes related to \"respect for decency, dignity and those prohibiting submission, violence or dependence, as well as the use of stereotypes.\" They even said that this ad is causing \"mental harm to adolescents.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/advertising/degrading-yves-saint-laurent-ads-shock-french-public/308196|title='Misogynist' YSL Ads Shock Parisians Ahead of International Women's Day|date=2017-03-07|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Lot of sarcastic comments were made in social media about the ad and the poster was removed from the city.\n\n==Public relations and social media==\n[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]\n\nFashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.<ref>Sherman, G., & Perlman, S.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

For men, [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Ice Cube]] have also helped define modern day fashion for black men. Today's fashion scene is not just clothes, but also hair and makeup. Recent trends have included the embracing of natural hair, traditional clothing worn with modern clothing, or traditional patterns used in modern clothing styles. All of these trends come with the long existing and persevering movement of \"Black is Beautiful\".\n\n=== Early American Fashion ===\nIn the mid to end of the 1900s, African American style changed and developed with the times. Around the 1950s is really when the black community was able to create their own distinct styles. The term \"Sunday attire\" was coined,  communities emphasized \"Correct\" dress, it was especially important when \"stepping out\" for social occasions with community members, a habit that continues in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/fashion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/african-american-dress|title=African American Dress {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Hair-dos and hairstyles also became a fashion statement, for example the \"conk\" which is hair that is slightly flattened and waved.<ref name=\":2\" /> Afros also emerged and they were often used to symbolize the rejection of white beauty standards at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-illustrative-identity_n_6519244|title=An Illustrative Identity of Fashion and Style Throughout African-American History and Movements|date=2015-02-10|website=HuffPost|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Around the 1970s is when flashy costumes began to appear and black artists really started to define their presences through fashion.

Supporters adorned symbolic clothing, accessories and hairstyles, usually native to Africa. Politics and fashion were fused together during this time and the use of these symbolic fashion statements sent a message to America and the rest of the world that African Americans were proud of their heritage.<ref name=\":3\" /> They aimed to send an even stronger message that black is beautiful and they were not afraid to embrace their identities.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example would the [[Kente cloth]], it is a brightly colored strip of cloth that is stitched and woven together to create different accessories.<ref name=\":3\" /> This woven cloth of brightly colored strips of fabric became a strong symbolic representation of pride in African identity for African Americans of the 1960s and later.

It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]], replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], the Court of Final Appeal is constitutionally allowed to exercise its judicial powers free from interference. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the functions and procedures of the court.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Role of the Court ==\nFrom the 1840s to 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|British Dependent Territory]], and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|power to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong]] was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Based on the [[one country, two systems]] principle, Hong Kong retains its a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the [[court of last resort]], thus administering the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nUnder the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] remains a [[common law]] jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. Judges appointed pursuant to Article 92 have served in the judiciaries of [[England and Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]].\n\nThe court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016060146/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf|date=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204031554/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf|date=4 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Court Structure ==\nThe Court of Final Appeal has no [[original jurisdiction]]; an appeal has to originate from the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (either from the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]). Whether an appeal is allowed or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge no be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels.\n\nAll appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice's place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances, two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court.\n\nThere is also a [[Registrar (Hong Kong)|Registrar]] appointed to the Court of Final Appeal, to help with review of appeal applications and other administrative duties.\n== Article 158 Interpretation Controversy ==\nThe controversial power of final interpretation of national law including the Basic Law is vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC, however national laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong.\n\nArticle 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of \"undermining judicial independence\", an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case considered quitting the top court in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/978391/all-citys-top-judges-considered-quitting|title=All city's top judges 'considered quitting'|last=|first=|date=|website=SCMP|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nInstances of Article 158 interpretations are as follows: \n\n* 1999: [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* 2004: Election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong\n* 2005: [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]]\n* 2012: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts\n* 2016: [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]\n\n== Building ==\nFrom its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the [[Former French Mission Building]], in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr95-96/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pw081158.htm |title = Finance Committee \u2013 Public Works Subcommittee (Papers) 8 Nov 95 |publisher = Government of Hong Kong |accessdate = 20 June 2015}}</ref> In September 2015 the court relocated to the former (until 2011) [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], which was originally the colonial [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] (1912\u20131985).\n\n* [[Former French Mission Building]] (1 July 1997 \u2013 6 September 2015)\n* [[Court of Final Appeal Building]] (7 September 2015 \u2013 Present)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Court of Final Appeal (HK).jpg|The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong was housed in the [[Former French Mission Building]] until September 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal.jpg|Entrance of the [[Former French Mission Building]]\nFile:Legislative Council Building HK.jpg|The Court of Final Appeal building seen from [[Chater Road]] before its renovation\nFile:Legislative Council building.JPG|The Court of Final Appeal is currently housed in 8 Jackson Road, former home of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], since 7 Sept 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal at night.jpg|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal building at night from Prince's Building\nFile:Court of Final Appeal plaque.jpg|Plaque beside the entrance of the Court of Final Appeal\n</gallery>\n\n== List of Permanent Judges ==\n===[[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal|Chief Justices]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Name\n!Chinese name\n!Took office\n!Left office \n!Tenure length\n!Silk\n|-\n|1\n|[[Andrew Li|Andrew Li Kwok-nang]], <small>GBM</small><br><small>(Born {{dts|format=dmy|12 December 1948}};

[[supreme court|final appellate court]] of Hong Kong. It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]], replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], the Court of Final Appeal is constitutionally allowed to exercise its judicial powers free from interference. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the functions and procedures of the court.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Role of the Court ==\nFrom the 1840s to 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|British Dependent Territory]], and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|power to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong]] was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Based on the [[one country, two systems]] principle, Hong Kong retains its a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the [[court of last resort]], thus administering the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nUnder the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] remains a [[common law]] jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. Judges appointed pursuant to Article 92 have served in the judiciaries of [[England and Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]].\n\nThe court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016060146/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf|date=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204031554/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf|date=4 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Court Structure ==\nThe Court of Final Appeal has no [[original jurisdiction]]; an appeal has to originate from the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (either from the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]). Whether an appeal is allowed or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge no be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels.\n\nAll appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice's place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances, two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court.\n\nThere is also a [[Registrar (Hong Kong)|Registrar]] appointed to the Court of Final Appeal, to help with review of appeal applications and other administrative duties.\n== Article 158 Interpretation Controversy ==\nThe controversial power of final interpretation of national law including the Basic Law is vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC, however national laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong.\n\nArticle 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of \"undermining judicial independence\", an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case considered quitting the top court in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/978391/all-citys-top-judges-considered-quitting|title=All city's top judges 'considered quitting'|last=|first=|date=|website=SCMP|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nInstances of Article 158 interpretations are as follows: \n\n* 1999: [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* 2004: Election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong\n* 2005: [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]]\n* 2012: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts\n* 2016: [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]\n\n== Building ==\nFrom its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the [[Former French Mission Building]], in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr95-96/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pw081158.htm |title = Finance Committee \u2013 Public Works Subcommittee (Papers) 8 Nov 95 |publisher = Government of Hong Kong |accessdate = 20 June 2015}}</ref> In September 2015 the court relocated to the former (until 2011) [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], which was originally the colonial [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] (1912\u20131985).\n\n* [[Former French Mission Building]] (1 July 1997 \u2013 6 September 2015)\n* [[Court of Final Appeal Building]] (7 September 2015 \u2013 Present)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Court of Final Appeal (HK).jpg|The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong was housed in the [[Former French Mission Building]] until September 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal.jpg|Entrance of the [[Former French Mission Building]]\nFile:Legislative Council Building HK.jpg|The Court of Final Appeal building seen from [[Chater Road]] before its renovation\nFile:Legislative Council building.JPG|The Court of Final Appeal is currently housed in 8 Jackson Road, former home of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], since 7 Sept 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal at night.jpg|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal building at night from Prince's Building\nFile:Court of Final Appeal plaque.jpg|Plaque beside the entrance of the Court of Final Appeal\n</gallery>\n\n== List of Permanent Judges ==\n===[[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal|Chief Justices]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Name\n!Chinese name\n!Took office\n!Left office \n!Tenure length\n!Silk\n|-\n|1\n|[[Andrew Li|Andrew Li Kwok-nang]], <small>GBM</small><br><small>(Born {{dts|format=dmy|12 December 1948}};

After a successful season at Brighton he transferred to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2010, before moving back to the South Coast club in 2012.\n\nA tough-tackling midfielder, Crofts represented Wales, where one of his grandparents was born, at under-19 and under-21 level and won his first senior [[cap (sport)|cap]] in 2005. In 2008, he won his 12th cap, breaking the record for the most international caps received by a [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] player.\n\n==Early life==\nCrofts was born in [[Chatham, Kent]], and began playing competitive football at the age of six for a club in nearby [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]]. Between the ages of 10 and 15 he attended weekly training sessions organised by [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

The original programme of Rexism borrowed strongly from [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralism]]. It rejected [[liberalism]], which it deemed decadent, and was strongly opposed to both [[Marxism]] and [[capitalism]], instead striving for a corporatist economic model, idealising rural life and traditional [[family values]].<ref name=\"Griffin132\">{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Griffin |author-link=Roger Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Pinter |year=1991 |page=132}}</ref>\n\nIn its early period \u2014 until around 1937 \u2014 Rexism cannot accurately be categorised as a fascist movement.

The party increasingly made use of fascist-style rhetoric, but only after Degrelle's own defeat in a by-election in April 1937 did it openly embrace [[anti-Semitism]] and anti-parliamentarism, following the model of German [[Nazism]]. Historian and expert on fascism [[Roger Griffin]] only considers the Rexist Party during the German occupation of Belgium as \"fully fascist\"; until then he considers it \"[[proto-fascism|proto-fascist]]\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Pinter |year=1991 |pages=132\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nThe Rexist movement attracted support almost exclusively from Wallonia. On 6 October 1936, party leader [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]] made a secret agreement with Rex's [[Flanders|Flemish]] counterpart, the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]] (VNV; \"Flemish National Union\") led by [[Staf De Clercq]].<ref name=SP119>''Geheim akkoord tussen Rex en VNV'' quoted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Gerard |editor1-first=Emmanuel |editor2-last=Van Nieuwenhuyse |editor2-first=Karel |title=Scripta Politica: Politieke Geschiedenis van Belgi\u00eb in Documenten (1918\u20132008) |year=2010 |publisher=Acco |location=Leuven |isbn=9789033480393 |pages=119\u201320 |edition=2nd revised}}</ref> Both movements strove for a corporatist system, but unlike the Rexists, the VNV sought to separate Flanders from Belgium and to unite it with the [[Netherlands]].

It targeted disappointed constituencies such as traditionalist Catholics, veterans, small traders and jobless people. In the [[Great Depression|Depression]] era, it initially won considerable popularity \u2014 mostly due to its leader's charisma and energy.

The Party espoused a \"right-wing revolution\" and the dominance of the [[Roman Catholicism in Belgium|Catholic Church in Belgium]],<ref name=SP112>{{cite book |editor1-last=Gerard |editor1-first=Emmanuel |editor2-last=Van Nieuwenhuyse |editor2-first=Karel |title=Scripta Politica: Politieke Geschiedenis van Belgi\u00eb in Documenten (1918\u20132008) |year=2010 |publisher=Acco |location=Leuven |isbn=9789033480393 |page=112|edition=2e herwerkte dr.}}</ref> but its ideology came to be vigorously opposed by the leader of the Belgian Church [[Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey|Cardinal van Roey]], who called Rexism a \"danger to the church and to the country\".<ref name=\"Richard Bonney pp. 175-176\"/>\n\n==Ideology==\nThe ideology of Rex, which was loosely based on the writings of [[Jean Denis (politician)|Jean Denis]], called for the \"moral renewal\" of Belgian society through dominance of the Catholic Church, by forming a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] society and abolishing [[liberal democracy]].<ref name=\"Brustein 1988\">{{cite journal |author=Brustein |title=The Case of Rexism |year=1988}}</ref> Denis became an enthusiastic member of Rex, and later wrote for the party newspaper ''[[Le Pays R\u00e9el]]''. The original programme of Rexism borrowed strongly from [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralism]]. It rejected [[liberalism]], which it deemed decadent, and was strongly opposed to both [[Marxism]] and [[capitalism]], instead striving for a corporatist economic model, idealising rural life and traditional [[family values]].<ref name=\"Griffin132\">{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Griffin |author-link=Roger Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Pinter |year=1991 |page=132}}</ref>\n\nIn its early period \u2014 until around 1937 \u2014 Rexism cannot accurately be categorised as a fascist movement. Rather it was a [[populism|populist]],<ref name=\"Griffin132\"/> authoritarian and conservative Catholic nationalist movement<ref>{{cite book |first=Jean-Michel |last=\u00c9tienne |title=Le mouvement Rexiste jusqu'en 1940 |publisher=Armand Colin |year=1968}}</ref> that initially tried to win power by democratic means, and did not want to totally abolish democratic institutions. The party increasingly made use of fascist-style rhetoric, but only after Degrelle's own defeat in a by-election in April 1937 did it openly embrace [[anti-Semitism]] and anti-parliamentarism, following the model of German [[Nazism]]. Historian and expert on fascism [[Roger Griffin]] only considers the Rexist Party during the German occupation of Belgium as \"fully fascist\"; until then he considers it \"[[proto-fascism|proto-fascist]]\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Pinter |year=1991 |pages=132\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nThe Rexist movement attracted support almost exclusively from Wallonia. On 6 October 1936, party leader [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]] made a secret agreement with Rex's [[Flanders|Flemish]] counterpart, the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]] (VNV; \"Flemish National Union\") led by [[Staf De Clercq]].<ref name=SP119>''Geheim akkoord tussen Rex en VNV'' quoted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Gerard |editor1-first=Emmanuel |editor2-last=Van Nieuwenhuyse |editor2-first=Karel |title=Scripta Politica: Politieke Geschiedenis van Belgi\u00eb in Documenten (1918\u20132008) |year=2010 |publisher=Acco |location=Leuven |isbn=9789033480393 |pages=119\u201320 |edition=2nd revised}}</ref> Both movements strove for a corporatist system, but unlike the Rexists, the VNV sought to separate Flanders from Belgium and to unite it with the [[Netherlands]]. The Flemish side cancelled the agreement after just one year.<ref>{{cite book |first=Giovanni |last=Capoccia |title=Defending Democracy: Reactions to Extremism in Interwar Europe |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2005 |page=114}}</ref> It also faced competition from the ideologically similar (but explicitly anti-German) L\u00e9gion Nationale (\"National Legion\") of [[Paul Hoornaert]].\n\n==Pre-war politics==\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle, 1941.jpg|thumb|200px|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex, pictured at a pre-war rally]]\nThe Rexist Party was founded in 1935 after its leader L\u00e9on Degrelle had left the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] which he deemed too moderate. It targeted disappointed constituencies such as traditionalist Catholics, veterans, small traders and jobless people. In the [[Great Depression|Depression]] era, it initially won considerable popularity \u2014 mostly due to its leader's charisma and energy. Its greatest success was when it won 11.5 per cent of the total vote in the [[1936 Belgian general election|1936 election]].<ref name=\"WorldFasc_86\">{{cite book |first=Bruno |last=De Wever |chapter=Belgium |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |page=86}}</ref> On that occasion the Rexist Party took 21 of the 202 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 8 out of 101 in the Senate, making it the fourth-strongest force in Parliament, behind the major established parties (Labour, Catholic, Liberal).\n\nHowever, the support for the party (even at its height) was extremely localized: Rexists succeeded in garnering over 30 per cent of the vote in the French-speaking [[Luxembourg (province)|province of Luxembourg]], compared with just 9 per cent in equally French-speaking Hainaut.<ref name=\"Brustein 1988\"/> Degrelle admired [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power and progressively imitated the tone and style of fascist campaigning, while the movement's ties to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were increasingly repudiated by the Belgian clergy. Rexism received subsidies from both Hitler and Mussolini.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDegrelle ran in the April 1937 Brussels by-election against Prime Minister [[Paul van Zeeland]] of the Catholic Party, who was supported \u2014 in the hope of thwarting a Rexist victory \u2014 by all other parties, including even the Communists.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Robert O. |last=Paxton |title=The Anatomy of Fascism |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2004 |page=74}}</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels|Archbishop of Mechelen]] and primate of the Catholic Church of Belgium, [[Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey]], intervened, rebuking Rexist voters, insisting that even abstention from voting would be sinful, and calling Rexism \"a danger to the country and to the Church\". Degrelle was decisively defeated: he obtained only 20 per cent of the vote, the rest going to Van Zeeland.<ref>Richard Bonney ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936\u20131939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 {{ISBN|978-3-03911-904-2}}; pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Rexism allied itself with the interests of [[Nazi Germany]] even more strongly and incorporated [[Nazism|Nazi]]-style [[antisemitism]] into its platform. At the same time, its popularity declined sharply.<ref name=diMuro151-3>{{cite book|last=di Muro|first=Giovanni F.|title=L\u00e9on Degrelle et l'aventure rexiste|year=2005|publisher=Pire|location=Bruxelles|isbn=2874155195|pages=151\u20133}}</ref> In the [[1939 Belgian general election|1939 national election]], Rex's share of votes fell to 4.4 per cent, and the party lost 17 of its 21 seats, largely to the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic]] and [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal parties]].<ref name=diMuro151-3/>\n\n==Second World War==\n{{Fascism sidebar}}\nWith the [[Belgium in World War II#18 days' campaign|German invasion of Belgium]] in 1940, Rexism welcomed German occupation, even though it had initially supported the pre-war Belgian policy of neutrality.<ref name=diMuro160-1>{{cite book|last=di Muro|first=Giovanni F.|title=L\u00e9on Degrelle et l'aventure rexiste|year=2005|publisher=Pire|location=Bruxelles|isbn=2874155195|pages=160\u20131}}</ref>  While some former Rexists went into the underground resistance or (like [[Jos\u00e9 Streel]]) withdrew from politics after they had come to see the Nazis' anticlerical and extreme anti-Semitic policies enforced in occupied Belgium, most Rexists, however, proudly supported the occupiers and assisted German forces with the repression of the territory wherever they could.<ref name=diMuro160-1/> Nevertheless, the popularity of Rex continued to drop. In 1941, at a reunion in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], Degrelle was booed by about a hundred demonstrators.<ref name=diMuro160-1/>\n\nIn August 1944, Rexist militia were responsible for the [[Courcelles Massacre]].\n\n===Collaboration===\nClosely affiliated with Rex was the ''[[5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien|L\u00e9gion Wallonie]]'', a [[paramilitary]] organization which later became the \"Wallonien\" Division of the [[Waffen SS]]. After [[Operation Barbarossa]] started, the L\u00e9gion Wallonie and its Flemish counterpart, the ''[[6th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Langemarck|Legion Flandern]]'' sent respectively 25,000 and 15,000 volunteers to fight against the [[Soviet Union]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. Degrelle took command of the Wallonien division, where he fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Whilst Degrelle was absent, nominal leadership of the party passed to [[Victor Matthys]].\n\n==End of Rexism==\nFrom the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the party had been banned. With the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, many former Rexists were imprisoned or executed for their role during collaboration. [[Victor Matthys]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Streel]] were both executed by firing squad, [[Jean Denis (politician)|Jean Denis]] (who had played only a minor role during the war) was imprisoned.\n\nDegrelle took refuge in [[Francoist Spain]]. He was convicted of [[treason]] ''in absentia'' in Belgium and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], but repeated requests to [[extradition|extradite]] him were turned down by the Spanish government. Stripped of his citizenship and excommunicated (later lifted in Germany), Degrelle died in [[M\u00e1laga]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last=Domenico|first=Roy P.
