The decision to declare war was made by [[Adolf Hitler]], apparently offhand, almost without consultation. Publicly, the formal declaration was made to American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B. Morris]] by German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in the latter's office. Later that day, the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|U.S. declared war on Germany]].\n\nWidely considered a major error in the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[dictatorship]]'s strategic actions during the war, the Nazi hierarchy held low regard for the military resolve of the U.S. under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Through the eyes of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[ideology]] practiced by Hitler and other senior Nazis, the U.S. constituted a [[Corruption|corrupt]], [[Decadence|decadent]], and fundamentally weak nation given factors such as the large population of [[African-Americans]], [[immigrants]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] as well as the free-for-all nature of U.S. [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe course of relations between Germany and the United States had deteriorated since the beginning of World War II, inevitably so given the increasing cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States]], the extension of the [[Pan-American Security Zone]], and many other results of the [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and [[Nazi Germany]]. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a ''de facto'' war with German [[U-Boats]].<ref name=bullock>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1992) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''.  New York: Knopf. pp.766-67 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}</ref> Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US [[isolationism|isolationist]] lobby, and [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|legal impediments]] imposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent.  He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] should that occur.  Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over [[Singapore]] from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.<ref name=bullock661>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1962) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. pp.661-64. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B06275A, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Closeup of Hitler as war is declared upon the United States, 11 December 1941]]\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,<ref name=bullock661 /> and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.<ref>Kershaw (2007), pp.444-446</ref><ref name=fest655 /><ref name=burleigh731 />\n\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars &ndash; the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured.  It also simplified matters for the American government, as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] recalled:\n\n<blockquote>When Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony.  The mood of the American people was obvious &ndash; they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished.  We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph.  It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\"<ref>[[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith, John Kenneth]], interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995) ''Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth'' New York, Knopf. p.267-8. {{ISBN|0-394-52915-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him &ndash; he had done the same thing when he attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \"[O]ne should strike &ndash; as hard as possible &ndash; and not waste time declaring war.\"<ref name=bullock661 />  Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny.  As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\n\n<blockquote>I can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.<ref name=bullock661 /></blockquote>\n\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.<ref name=bullock661 /> As early as mid-March 1941 &ndash; nine months before the Japanese attack &ndash; President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|the destructive potential it presented]]. Due to this attitude within the [[White House]], and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the [[Arsenal of Democracy|\"arsenal of democracy\"]] for itself and its allies.\n\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \"Negroes\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \"good life\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \"negrofied\" music.  Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany<ref name=bullock661 /> \u2014 and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (''Second Book'', 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.<ref>Hillgruber (1981), pp.50-51</ref>\n\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler's own ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germany's current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of [[Lebensraum|'living space']] and race held the key to his image of the United States. To Hitler the United States was a country with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, and in which he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.<ref>As late as 24 February 1945, Hitler spoke of the 'vast territory' of the United States in America, 'ample to absorb the energies of all their people', as the model which he hoped to emulate for Germany in Europe, 'to ensure for her complete economic independence inside a territory of a size compatible with her population', adding that 'a great people has need of broad acres' Genoud, Francois (ed.)

Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s signing of the declaration of war against Germany, the response of the United States to Hitler's declaration]]\n\nThe one advantage which the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement.  Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible.  Hitler, in fact, put off the speech &ndash; and the declaration of war &ndash; for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.<ref>Kershaw (2000), pp.444-45</ref>  Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \"unnatural alliance\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union.  [[Joachim C.

That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\"<ref name=fest655 />\n\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war.  At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.<ref name=bullock /><ref name=fest655>[[Joachim C.

By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in [[World War I]], led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable.  As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping.  While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-if-hitler-never-declared-war-the-us-during-world-war-ii-17573 |title=What If Hitler Never Declared War on the U.S. During World War II?|last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=2 September 2016 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> the war declaration enabled the [[Second Happy Time]] for U-boats.<ref>Duncan Redford and Grove, Philip D.

Peter Padfield writes:\n\n<blockquote>The news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States.  Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war.  His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.<ref>Padfield, Peter (1984) ''D\u00f6nitz: The Last Fuhrer: Portrait of a Nazi War Leader'' London: Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-03186-7}}. p.235; quoting Warlimont, W.

The time selected was 3:00 pm, as it was a convenient time for German radio listeners and the broadcast could be received in Tokyo at 10 pm and in Washington DC at 8:00 am. Ribbentrop telephoned the German ambassador in Rome, asking him to contact Mussolini and ensure that Italy's declaration of war be coordinated with Germany's. Meanwhile, there was considerable diplomatic activity to ensure that the amendments to the Tripartite Pact requested by the Japanese government be concluded; the Germans requested that the Japanese ambassador, [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], should be empowered to sign the [[Tripartite Pact#\"No separate peace\" agreement|\"No separate peace\" agreement]] on Tokyo's behalf to save time.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 236</ref>\n\nBritain and the United States were already aware of German intentions through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] signals intelligence and on 9 December, Roosevelt gave one of his \"[[fireside chats|fireside chat]]\" national broadcasts in which he said that American people should \"Remember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal declaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with Britain or Russia\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 223-225</ref> Churchill spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the morning of 11 December, saying that; \"Not only the British Empire now but the United States are fighting for life; Russia is fighting for life, and China is fighting for life.

In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American [[destroyers]], as for instance the [[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]], the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|Kearney]] and the [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|Reuben James]], have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The [[Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the American Navy]], Mr. [[Frank Knox|Knox]], himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German [[submarines]].\n\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German [[Merchant ship|merchant vessels]] on the high seas as enemy ships.\n\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the [[World War II|present war]], the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a [[Declaration of war|state of war]].\n\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues [[diplomatic relations]] with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\n\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nRIBBENTROP.<ref>{{cite web|title=German Declaration of War with the United States : December 11, 1941|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gerdec41.asp|work=The Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same text had been sent to [[Hans Thomsen]], the German ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' in Washington, with instructions to present it to [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] at 3:30 pm, German [[summer time]], 8:30 am [[Eastern Standard Time]].<ref>Smyth & Lambert 1964, p. 999</ref> On their arrival however, Hull refused to see the German delegation and it was not until 9:30 that they were able pass their note to [[Ray Atherton]], the head of the Division of European Affairs.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref> In Berlin, there was consternation that Mussolini had decided to preempt Hitler and declare war in a speech from the balcony at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] at 2:45 pm; an estimated crowd of 100,000 gathered to hear his speech which lasted only four minutes.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 248-249</ref>\n\nAt 3:00 pm, Hitler addressed the 855 deputies of the Reichstag gathered in the [[Kroll Opera House]], with a speech lasting for 88 minutes in which he listed German successes to date but failed to mention the stalled offensive in Russia. The second part of the speech was devoted to an attack on Roosevelt and the \"the Anglo-Saxon Jewish-capitalist world\", concluding that \"In the 2,000 years of German history known to us, our ''Volk'' has never been more unified and united than it is today\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 250-253</ref> On the same day, German ambassadors in the capitals of the other Tripartite Pact signatories; [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], were instructed to obtain their declarations of war against the United States.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref>\n\nRoosevelt had written a brief note to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the morning of 11 December asking them to declare war on Germany and Italy; meeting at noon, the motion passed through both houses without dissent, although there were some abstentions.

The decision to declare war was made by [[Adolf Hitler]], apparently offhand, almost without consultation. Publicly, the formal declaration was made to American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B. Morris]] by German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in the latter's office. Later that day, the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|U.S. declared war on Germany]].\n\nWidely considered a major error in the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[dictatorship]]'s strategic actions during the war, the Nazi hierarchy held low regard for the military resolve of the U.S. under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Through the eyes of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[ideology]] practiced by Hitler and other senior Nazis, the U.S. constituted a [[Corruption|corrupt]], [[Decadence|decadent]], and fundamentally weak nation given factors such as the large population of [[African-Americans]], [[immigrants]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] as well as the free-for-all nature of U.S. [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe course of relations between Germany and the United States had deteriorated since the beginning of World War II, inevitably so given the increasing cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States]], the extension of the [[Pan-American Security Zone]], and many other results of the [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and [[Nazi Germany]]. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a ''de facto'' war with German [[U-Boats]].<ref name=bullock>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1992) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''.  New York: Knopf. pp.766-67 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}</ref> Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US [[isolationism|isolationist]] lobby, and [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|legal impediments]] imposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent.  He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] should that occur.  Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over [[Singapore]] from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.<ref name=bullock661>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1962) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. pp.661-64. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B06275A, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Closeup of Hitler as war is declared upon the United States, 11 December 1941]]\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,<ref name=bullock661 /> and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.<ref>Kershaw (2007), pp.444-446</ref><ref name=fest655 /><ref name=burleigh731 />\n\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars &ndash; the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured.  It also simplified matters for the American government, as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] recalled:\n\n<blockquote>When Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony.  The mood of the American people was obvious &ndash; they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished.  We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph.  It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\"<ref>[[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith, John Kenneth]], interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995) ''Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth'' New York, Knopf. p.267-8. {{ISBN|0-394-52915-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him &ndash; he had done the same thing when he attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \"[O]ne should strike &ndash; as hard as possible &ndash; and not waste time declaring war.\"<ref name=bullock661 />  Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny.  As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\n\n<blockquote>I can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.<ref name=bullock661 /></blockquote>\n\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.<ref name=bullock661 /> As early as mid-March 1941 &ndash; nine months before the Japanese attack &ndash; President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|the destructive potential it presented]]. Due to this attitude within the [[White House]], and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the [[Arsenal of Democracy|\"arsenal of democracy\"]] for itself and its allies.\n\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \"Negroes\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \"good life\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \"negrofied\" music.  Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany<ref name=bullock661 /> \u2014 and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (''Second Book'', 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.<ref>Hillgruber (1981), pp.50-51</ref>\n\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler's own ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germany's current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of [[Lebensraum|'living space']] and race held the key to his image of the United States. To Hitler the United States was a country with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, and in which he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.<ref>As late as 24 February 1945, Hitler spoke of the 'vast territory' of the United States in America, 'ample to absorb the energies of all their people', as the model which he hoped to emulate for Germany in Europe, 'to ensure for her complete economic independence inside a territory of a size compatible with her population', adding that 'a great people has need of broad acres' Genoud, Francois (ed.)

Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s signing of the declaration of war against Germany, the response of the United States to Hitler's declaration]]\n\nThe one advantage which the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement.  Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible.  Hitler, in fact, put off the speech &ndash; and the declaration of war &ndash; for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.<ref>Kershaw (2000), pp.444-45</ref>  Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \"unnatural alliance\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union.  [[Joachim C. Fest]], one of Hitler's biographers, has argued that Hitler's decision was \"really no longer an act of his own volition, but a gesture governed by a sudden awareness of his own impotence. That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\"<ref name=fest655 />\n\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war.  At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.<ref name=bullock /><ref name=fest655>[[Joachim C.

By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in [[World War I]], led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable.  As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping.  While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-if-hitler-never-declared-war-the-us-during-world-war-ii-17573 |title=What If Hitler Never Declared War on the U.S. During World War II?|last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=2 September 2016 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> the war declaration enabled the [[Second Happy Time]] for U-boats.<ref>Duncan Redford and Grove, Philip D.

Peter Padfield writes:\n\n<blockquote>The news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States.  Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war.  His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.<ref>Padfield, Peter (1984) ''D\u00f6nitz: The Last Fuhrer: Portrait of a Nazi War Leader'' London: Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-03186-7}}. p.235; quoting Warlimont, W.

The time selected was 3:00 pm, as it was a convenient time for German radio listeners and the broadcast could be received in Tokyo at 10 pm and in Washington DC at 8:00 am. Ribbentrop telephoned the German ambassador in Rome, asking him to contact Mussolini and ensure that Italy's declaration of war be coordinated with Germany's. Meanwhile, there was considerable diplomatic activity to ensure that the amendments to the Tripartite Pact requested by the Japanese government be concluded; the Germans requested that the Japanese ambassador, [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], should be empowered to sign the [[Tripartite Pact#\"No separate peace\" agreement|\"No separate peace\" agreement]] on Tokyo's behalf to save time.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 236</ref>\n\nBritain and the United States were already aware of German intentions through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] signals intelligence and on 9 December, Roosevelt gave one of his \"[[fireside chats|fireside chat]]\" national broadcasts in which he said that American people should \"Remember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal declaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with Britain or Russia\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 223-225</ref> Churchill spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the morning of 11 December, saying that; \"Not only the British Empire now but the United States are fighting for life; Russia is fighting for life, and China is fighting for life. Behind these four great combatant communities are ranged all the free spirit and hopes of all the conquered countries in Europe...  It would indeed bring shame upon our generation if we did not teach them a lesson which will not be forgotten in the records of a thousand years\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 247</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 11 December 1941, American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B.

CHARGE D'AFFAIRES:\n\nThe Government of the United States having violated in the most flagrant manner and in ever increasing measure all rules of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in favor of the adversaries of Germany and having continually been guilty of the most severe provocations toward Germany ever since the outbreak of the European war, provoked by the [[Neville Chamberlain#Declaration of war|British declaration of war against Germany]] on September 3, 1939, has finally resorted to open military acts of aggression.\n\nOn September 11, 1941, the [[President of the United States]] publicly declared that he had ordered the American Navy and Air Force to shoot on sight at any German war vessel. In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American [[destroyers]], as for instance the [[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]], the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|Kearney]] and the [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|Reuben James]], have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The [[Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the American Navy]], Mr. [[Frank Knox|Knox]], himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German [[submarines]].\n\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German [[Merchant ship|merchant vessels]] on the high seas as enemy ships.\n\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the [[World War II|present war]], the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a [[Declaration of war|state of war]].\n\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues [[diplomatic relations]] with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\n\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nRIBBENTROP.<ref>{{cite web|title=German Declaration of War with the United States : December 11, 1941|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gerdec41.asp|work=The Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same text had been sent to [[Hans Thomsen]], the German ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' in Washington, with instructions to present it to [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] at 3:30 pm, German [[summer time]], 8:30 am [[Eastern Standard Time]].<ref>Smyth & Lambert 1964, p. 999</ref> On their arrival however, Hull refused to see the German delegation and it was not until 9:30 that they were able pass their note to [[Ray Atherton]], the head of the Division of European Affairs.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref> In Berlin, there was consternation that Mussolini had decided to preempt Hitler and declare war in a speech from the balcony at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] at 2:45 pm; an estimated crowd of 100,000 gathered to hear his speech which lasted only four minutes.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 248-249</ref>\n\nAt 3:00 pm, Hitler addressed the 855 deputies of the Reichstag gathered in the [[Kroll Opera House]], with a speech lasting for 88 minutes in which he listed German successes to date but failed to mention the stalled offensive in Russia. The second part of the speech was devoted to an attack on Roosevelt and the \"the Anglo-Saxon Jewish-capitalist world\", concluding that \"In the 2,000 years of German history known to us, our ''Volk'' has never been more unified and united than it is today\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 250-253</ref> On the same day, German ambassadors in the capitals of the other Tripartite Pact signatories; [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], were instructed to obtain their declarations of war against the United States.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref>\n\nRoosevelt had written a brief note to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the morning of 11 December asking them to declare war on Germany and Italy; meeting at noon, the motion passed through both houses without dissent, although there were some abstentions.
