To learn a movement, a \u201cmotor program\u201d consisting of two states of memory (i.e. memory trace and perceptual trace), is required. The memory trace (equivalent to recall memory in verbal learning) initiates the motor movement, chooses its initial direction and determines the earliest portions of the movement. Strengthening of the memory trace results from practice and feedback about movement outcome (see motor learning). In addition, the perceptual trace (similar to recognition memory in verbal tasks) is involved in guidance of the limb to the correct position along a trajectory. This is accomplished by comparing incoming feedback to the perceptual trace, which is formed from the sensory consequences of the limb being at the correct/incorrect endpoint in past experience. In the event of an error, the limb is adjusted until the movement is appropriate to the goal of the action. Importantly, the more accurate the movement, the more useful the perceptual trace that is collected and retained.\n\nThough this theory represented an important leap forward in motor learning research,<ref name=\"Schmidt 2005\"/> one weakness in Adams\u2019 closed-loop theory was the requirement of 1-to-1 mapping between stored states (motor programs) and movements to be made. This presented an issue related to the storage capacity of the central nervous system; a vast array of movements would require equally large repository of motor programs. Additionally, this theory could not be used to explain how motor programs for novel movements were formed.\n\n=== Schmidt\u2019s schema theory ===\n\nEarly motor program theories did not adequately account for  evidence illustrating the influence of feedback  for the modification of ongoing movement  while providing a suitable explanation of motor programs storage or application in novel movement. Consequently, the notion of the generalized motor program (GMP) was developed.<ref name=\"Schmidt 2005\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;205</sup> The GMP is thought to contain an abstract representation for a class of movements with invariant features pertaining to the order of events, the relative timing of events and the relative force with which events are produced. In order to determine how a particular movement should be performed, parameters such as overall movement duration, overall force of contractions and the muscles involved are specified to the GMP. This revision of the motor program concept allows many different movements to be produced with the same motor program as well as the production of novel movements by specifying new parameters.\n\nRichard Schmidt (1975) proposed the schema theory for motor control,<ref name=\"Schmidt 1975\">{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Richard A.|title=A schema theory of discrete motor skill learning.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=82| issue=4|year=1975| pages=225\u2013260| url=http://www.hp-research.com/sites/default/files/publications/Schmidt%20%28Psych%20Review,%201975%29.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0076770}}</ref> suggesting in opposition to closed-loop theories, that a motor program containing general rules can be applied to different environmental or situational contexts via the involvement of  open-loop control process and GMPs.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\">{{Cite book  | last1 = Shumway-Cook | first1 = Anne | last2 = Woollacott | first2 = Marjorie H. | title = Motor control : theory and practical application | year = 2001 | publisher = Lippincott Williams Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 978-0-683-30643-9 | oclc= 499223436 }}</ref><sup>p.&nbsp;32</sup> In Schmidt's theory, the [[schema (psychology)]] contains the generalized rules that generate the spatial and temporal muscle patterns to produce a specified movement.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;32</sup> Therefore,  when learning novel movements an individual may generate  a new GMP based on the selection of parameters (reducing the novel movement problem), or refine an existing GMP (reducing the storage problem), depending on prior experience with movement and task context.\n\nAccording to Schmidt, four things are stored in memory after an individual generates a movement:<ref name=\"Schmidt 1975\"/>\n# The initial conditions of the movement, such as the proprioceptive information of the limbs and body.\n# The response specifications for the motor programs, which are the parameters used in the generalized motor program, such as speed and force.\n# The sensory consequences of the response, which contain information about how the movement felt, looked and sounded.\n# The outcome of that movement, which contains information of the actual outcome of the movement with knowledge of results (KR).\n\nThis information is stored in components of the motor response schema, which include the recall schema and recognition schema. The recall and recognition schema are strongly associated, as they use the relationship between the initial condition and actual outcomes; however, they are not isomorphic.<ref name=\"Schmidt 1975\"/> They differ  in that recall schema is used to select a specific response with the use of response specifications, whereas the recognition schema is used to evaluate the response with the sensory consequences. Throughout a movement, the recognition schema is compared to the expected sensory information (e.g., proprioceptive and extroceptive) from the ongoing movement to evaluate the efficiency of the response.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;32</sup> An error signal is sent upon finalizing the movement, where the schema is then modified based on the sensory feedback and knowledge of results (see motor learning).\n\nThe schema theory illustrates that motor learning consists of continuous processes that update the recall and recognition schemas with each movement that is made.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;33</sup>\n\n=== Multiple paired forward and inverse models ===\n\nAn alternate viewpoint on the organization and control of motor programs may be considered a computational process of selecting a motor command (i.e., the input) to achieve a desired sensory feedback (i.e., the output).<ref name=\"Wolpert 1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolpert DM, Kawato M |title=Multiple paired forward and inverse models for motor control |journal=Neural Netw |volume=11 |issue=7\u20138 |pages=1317\u201329 |date=October 1998 |pmid=12662752 |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(98)00066-5 |url=http://www.cns.atr.jp/~kawato/Ppdf/1217.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.36.4705 }}</ref> Selection of the motor command depends on many internal and external variables, such as the current state of the limb(s), orientation of the body and properties of the items in the environment with which the body will interact. Given the vast number of possible combinations of these variables, the motor control system must be able to provide an appropriate command for any given context. One strategy for selecting appropriate commands involves a modular approach; multiple controllers exist such that each controller is suitable for one or a small set of contexts. Based on an estimate of the current context, a controller is chosen to generate the appropriate motor command.\n\nThis modular system can be used to describe both motor control and [[motor learning]] and requires adaptable internal forward and inverse models.  Forward models describe the forward or causal relationship between system inputs, predicting sensory feedback that will occur. Inverse models (controllers) generate the motor command that will cause a desired change in state, given an environmental context. During motor learning, the forward and inverse models are paired and tightly coupled by a responsibility signal within modules. Using the forward model's predictions and sensory contextual cues, responsibility signals indicate the degree to which each pair should be responsible for controlling current behavior.\n\n== Impairment of motor programs ==\n\n=== Cerebellar degeneration ===\n\nErrors in reaching are commonly found in patients with cerebellar degeneration.

To learn a movement, a \u201cmotor program\u201d consisting of two states of memory (i.e. memory trace and perceptual trace), is required. The memory trace (equivalent to recall memory in verbal learning) initiates the motor movement, chooses its initial direction and determines the earliest portions of the movement. Strengthening of the memory trace results from practice and feedback about movement outcome (see motor learning). In addition, the perceptual trace (similar to recognition memory in verbal tasks) is involved in guidance of the limb to the correct position along a trajectory. This is accomplished by comparing incoming feedback to the perceptual trace, which is formed from the sensory consequences of the limb being at the correct/incorrect endpoint in past experience. In the event of an error, the limb is adjusted until the movement is appropriate to the goal of the action. Importantly, the more accurate the movement, the more useful the perceptual trace that is collected and retained.\n\nThough this theory represented an important leap forward in motor learning research,<ref name=\"Schmidt 2005\"/> one weakness in Adams\u2019 closed-loop theory was the requirement of 1-to-1 mapping between stored states (motor programs) and movements to be made. This presented an issue related to the storage capacity of the central nervous system; a vast array of movements would require equally large repository of motor programs. Additionally, this theory could not be used to explain how motor programs for novel movements were formed.\n\n=== Schmidt\u2019s schema theory ===\n\nEarly motor program theories did not adequately account for  evidence illustrating the influence of feedback  for the modification of ongoing movement  while providing a suitable explanation of motor programs storage or application in novel movement. Consequently, the notion of the generalized motor program (GMP) was developed.<ref name=\"Schmidt 2005\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;205</sup> The GMP is thought to contain an abstract representation for a class of movements with invariant features pertaining to the order of events, the relative timing of events and the relative force with which events are produced. In order to determine how a particular movement should be performed, parameters such as overall movement duration, overall force of contractions and the muscles involved are specified to the GMP. This revision of the motor program concept allows many different movements to be produced with the same motor program as well as the production of novel movements by specifying new parameters.\n\nRichard Schmidt (1975) proposed the schema theory for motor control,<ref name=\"Schmidt 1975\">{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Richard A.|title=A schema theory of discrete motor skill learning.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=82| issue=4|year=1975| pages=225\u2013260| url=http://www.hp-research.com/sites/default/files/publications/Schmidt%20%28Psych%20Review,%201975%29.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0076770}}</ref> suggesting in opposition to closed-loop theories, that a motor program containing general rules can be applied to different environmental or situational contexts via the involvement of  open-loop control process and GMPs.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\">{{Cite book  | last1 = Shumway-Cook | first1 = Anne | last2 = Woollacott | first2 = Marjorie H. | title = Motor control : theory and practical application | year = 2001 | publisher = Lippincott Williams Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 978-0-683-30643-9 | oclc= 499223436 }}</ref><sup>p.&nbsp;32</sup> In Schmidt\u2019s theory, the [[schema (psychology)]] contains the generalized rules that generate the spatial and temporal muscle patterns to produce a specified movement.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;32</sup> Therefore,  when learning novel movements an individual may generate  a new GMP based on the selection of parameters (reducing the novel movement problem), or refine an existing GMP (reducing the storage problem), depending on prior experience with movement and task context.\n\nAccording to Schmidt, four things are stored in memory after an individual generates a movement:<ref name=\"Schmidt 1975\"/>\n# The initial conditions of the movement, such as the proprioceptive information of the limbs and body.\n# The response specifications for the motor programs, which are the parameters used in the generalized motor program, such as speed and force.\n# The sensory consequences of the response, which contain information about how the movement felt, looked and sounded.\n# The outcome of that movement, which contains information of the actual outcome of the movement with knowledge of results (KR).\n\nThis information is stored in components of the motor response schema, which include the recall schema and recognition schema. The recall and recognition schema are strongly associated, as they use the relationship between the initial condition and actual outcomes; however, they are not isomorphic.<ref name=\"Schmidt 1975\"/> They differ  in that recall schema is used to select a specific response with the use of response specifications, whereas the recognition schema is used to evaluate the response with the sensory consequences. Throughout a movement, the recognition schema is compared to the expected sensory information (e.g., proprioceptive and extroceptive) from the ongoing movement to evaluate the efficiency of the response.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;32</sup> An error signal is sent upon finalizing the movement, where the schema is then modified based on the sensory feedback and knowledge of results (see motor learning).\n\nThe schema theory illustrates that motor learning consists of continuous processes that update the recall and recognition schemas with each movement that is made.<ref name=\"Shumway-Cook 2001\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;33</sup>\n\n=== Multiple paired forward and inverse models ===\n\nAn alternate viewpoint on the organization and control of motor programs may be considered a computational process of selecting a motor command (i.e., the input) to achieve a desired sensory feedback (i.e., the output).<ref name=\"Wolpert 1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolpert DM, Kawato M |title=Multiple paired forward and inverse models for motor control |journal=Neural Netw |volume=11 |issue=7\u20138 |pages=1317\u201329 |date=October 1998 |pmid=12662752 |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(98)00066-5 |url=http://www.cns.atr.jp/~kawato/Ppdf/1217.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.36.4705 }}</ref> Selection of the motor command depends on many internal and external variables, such as the current state of the limb(s), orientation of the body and properties of the items in the environment with which the body will interact. Given the vast number of possible combinations of these variables, the motor control system must be able to provide an appropriate command for any given context. One strategy for selecting appropriate commands involves a modular approach; multiple controllers exist such that each controller is suitable for one or a small set of contexts. Based on an estimate of the current context, a controller is chosen to generate the appropriate motor command.\n\nThis modular system can be used to describe both motor control and [[motor learning]] and requires adaptable internal forward and inverse models.  Forward models describe the forward or causal relationship between system inputs, predicting sensory feedback that will occur. Inverse models (controllers) generate the motor command that will cause a desired change in state, given an environmental context. During motor learning, the forward and inverse models are paired and tightly coupled by a responsibility signal within modules. Using the forward model\u2019s predictions and sensory contextual cues, responsibility signals indicate the degree to which each pair should be responsible for controlling current behavior.\n\n== Impairment of motor programs ==\n\n=== Cerebellar degeneration ===\n\nErrors in reaching are commonly found in patients with cerebellar degeneration.

As the Optimates were senators and large landowners, they violently opposed the Gracchi, and finally murdered them, but their program was upheld by several politicians, called the [[Populares]] (\"favouring the people\").  For about 80 years, Roman politics was marked by the confrontation of these two factions.  The Optimates favoured the ancestral Roman laws and [[Mos maiorum|customs]], as well as the supremacy of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] over the popular assemblies and the tribunes of the plebs.  They also rejected the massive extension of Roman citizenship to Rome's [[Socii|Italian allies]] advocated by the Populares.  Although suspicious of powerful generals, they sided with [[Pompey]] when they came to believe that [[Julius Caesar]]\u2014himself a Popularis\u2014planned a coup against the Republic.  They disappeared with their defeat in the subsequent [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nWhile several leaders of the Optimates were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]\u2014belonging to the oldest noble families\u2014such as [[Sulla]] or [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (consul 138 BC)|Scipio Nasica Serapio]], many were [[Plebs|plebeians]]: the [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]], [[Pompey]], [[Cato the Younger]], [[Titus Annius Milo]], etc.  [[Cicero]]\u2014the most famous Optimas\u2014was even a ''[[Novus homo|novus homo]]'' (the first of his [[gens]] to be senator).\n\n== Views ==\nIn general, the Optimates favored the ''[[nobiles]]'' and opposed the ascension of ''[[Novus homo|novi homines]]'' into Roman politics, though exceptions exist. For instance, [[Cicero]] (a strong supporter of the Optimates' cause) was himself a ''novus homo'', being the first in his family to enter the Senate\u2014he was thus never fully accepted by the Optimates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Everitt|first=Anthony|author-link=Anthony Everitt|date=30 November 2001|title=Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM87vQsBaa0C&printsec=frontcover|publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]]|pages=400|isbn=9781588360342}}</ref> On the other hand, during the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war of 49 BC]] [[Julius Caesar]] of [[Julii Caesares|a respectable old family]] contended against a Senate championed by [[Pompey]], who was from a wealthy yet recently ennobled family. In addition to their political aims, the Optimates opposed the extension of [[Roman citizenship]] and sought the preservation of the ''[[mos maiorum]],'' the ways of their forefathers. They sought to prevent successful generals such as [[Gaius Marius]], Pompey and Julius Caesar from using their armies to accrue such power that they might be in a position to challenge the Senate. They opposed Marius' plan to enlist impoverished Romans who were too poor to provide their own arms and supplies in the legions and the generals' attempts to settle these veterans on state-owned land.\n\n== History ==\n[[John Sandys (classicist)|John Edwin Sandys]] detects an Optimates grouping at time of the death of [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sandys|first=John Edwin|author-link=John Sandys (classicist)|title=A Companion to Latin Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XV1oAAAAMAAJ|edition=3|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1921|page=125|quote=133[:] Tribute of Ti. Gracchus, his 'lex agraria' and destruction by a rabble of optimates, headed by P. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (consul 138 BC)|Scipio Nasica]] [...]}}.</ref> The Optimates' cause reached its peak under the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] (81 BC) of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Sulla's administration stripped the assemblies of nearly all power, raised the number of members of the Senate from 300 to 600, executed an equally large number of Populares via [[proscription]] lists and settled thousands of soldiers in northern Italy. However, after Sulla's withdrawal from public life (80 BC) and subsequent death (78 BC) many of their policies were gradually reversed. Besides Sulla, notable Optimates included [[Lucullus]], [[Cato the Younger]], [[Titus Annius Milo]], [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger]]. Though the Optimates had opposed him for the entirety of his political career, Pompey also found himself as the leader of the Optimates' faction once their [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] with Julius Caesar began in 49 BC.

As the Optimates were senators and large landowners, they violently opposed the Gracchi, and finally murdered them, but their program was upheld by several politicians, called the [[Populares]] (\"favouring the people\").  For about 80 years, Roman politics was marked by the confrontation of these two factions.  The Optimates favoured the ancestral Roman laws and [[Mos maiorum|customs]], as well as the supremacy of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] over the popular assemblies and the tribunes of the plebs.  They also rejected the massive extension of Roman citizenship to Rome's [[Socii|Italian allies]] advocated by the Populares.  Although suspicious of powerful generals, they sided with [[Pompey]] when they came to believe that [[Julius Caesar]]\u2014himself a Popularis\u2014planned a coup against the Republic.  They disappeared with their defeat in the subsequent [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nWhile several leaders of the Optimates were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]\u2014belonging to the oldest noble families\u2014such as [[Sulla]] or [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (consul 138 BC)|Scipio Nasica Serapio]], many were [[Plebs|plebeians]]: the [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]], [[Pompey]], [[Cato the Younger]], [[Titus Annius Milo]], etc.  [[Cicero]]\u2014the most famous Optimas\u2014was even a ''[[Novus homo|novus homo]]'' (the first of his [[gens]] to be senator).\n\n== Views ==\nIn general, the Optimates favored the ''[[nobiles]]'' and opposed the ascension of ''[[Novus homo|novi homines]]'' into Roman politics, though exceptions exist. For instance, [[Cicero]] (a strong supporter of the Optimates' cause) was himself a ''novus homo'', being the first in his family to enter the Senate\u2014he was thus never fully accepted by the Optimates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Everitt|first=Anthony|author-link=Anthony Everitt|date=30 November 2001|title=Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM87vQsBaa0C&printsec=frontcover|publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]]|pages=400|isbn=9781588360342}}</ref> On the other hand, during the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war of 49 BC]] [[Julius Caesar]] of [[Julii Caesares|a respectable old family]] contended against a Senate championed by [[Pompey]], who was from a wealthy yet recently ennobled family. In addition to their political aims, the Optimates opposed the extension of [[Roman citizenship]] and sought the preservation of the ''[[mos maiorum]],'' the ways of their forefathers. They sought to prevent successful generals such as [[Gaius Marius]], Pompey and Julius Caesar from using their armies to accrue such power that they might be in a position to challenge the Senate. They opposed Marius' plan to enlist impoverished Romans who were too poor to provide their own arms and supplies in the legions and the generals' attempts to settle these veterans on state-owned land.\n\n== History ==\n[[John Sandys (classicist)|John Edwin Sandys]] detects an Optimates grouping at time of the death of [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sandys|first=John Edwin|author-link=John Sandys (classicist)|title=A Companion to Latin Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XV1oAAAAMAAJ|edition=3|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1921|page=125|quote=133[:] Tribute of Ti.

Sulla's administration stripped the assemblies of nearly all power, raised the number of members of the Senate from 300 to 600, executed an equally large number of Populares via [[proscription]] lists and settled thousands of soldiers in northern Italy. However, after Sulla's withdrawal from public life (80 BC) and subsequent death (78 BC) many of their policies were gradually reversed. Besides Sulla, notable Optimates included [[Lucullus]], [[Cato the Younger]], [[Titus Annius Milo]], [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger]]. Though the Optimates had opposed him for the entirety of his political career, Pompey also found himself as the leader of the Optimates' faction once their [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] with Julius Caesar began in 49 BC.

A total of six units were built, with one prototype and five production units. They were among the last cars to be ordered by the BMT before the city takeover in 1940.\n\nThe cars were designed to operate on both elevated and subway lines; its lightweight design allowed it to run on the oldest elevated lines without the need to upgrade them to handle heavier cars, while its aluminum alloy body also allowed it to run in the newer subway tunnels, where wooden cars were strictly prohibited. The prototype Bluebird entered service in 1939. While the BMT ordered 50 production Bluebirds, only five were built, due to the [[New York City Board of Transportation]] cancelling the order when it took over operations of the BMT in 1940. The cars were in service until being retired in 1957.

The Bluebird was an example of [[Art Deco]] [[industrial design]], presenting a clean and mildly streamlined appearance. The Bluebird was designed during the [[Great Depression]] as a fast, physically attractive and comfortable [[mass transit]] vehicle that would attract [[passenger]]s, while instituting significant economies in production, operation, and maintenance.\n\nThe car's lightweight body and running gear, combined with its short truckbase and segmented body, permitted it to operate on the oldest elevated structures, with their light loading tolerance and sharp curves, as well as in [[tunnel]] sections, where policy prohibited the use of the [[BU cars (New York City Subway car)|wooden cars]] typically used on elevated lines.\n\nA single Bluebird unit, numbered 8000, was purchased by the BMT as a prototype for a planned fleet of equipment that could operate universally on both standard subway lines and older elevated lines. The BMT expected the Bluebird to preserve its investment in its elevated railway lines without expensive upgrading for heavier subway equipment, while attracting passengers with its interior comforts. Tests demonstrated that its greatly improved operating parameters could have cut significant time from existing elevated train schedules.\n\nBluebirds were the first PCC rapid transit cars utilizing the advanced running gear originally created for new-design [[streetcar]]s. In addition to quick acceleration and braking ({{convert|4|mph/s|km/h/s|abbr=on|disp=or}}), use of PCC technology meant that Bluebirds could share a significant parts and maintenance base with the [[Brooklyn]] transit company's planned PCC [[tram|trolley]] fleet, achieving economies of scale and efficiency.\n\nThe Bluebirds were built by [[Clark Equipment Company]] of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tmny.org/bluebird.html| title=\"Blue Bird\" train set at Clark's Battle Creek, Michigan, plant, 1939| website=Trolley Museum of New York| date=July 24, 2014| first=Evan| last=Jennings}}</ref> maker of PCC running gear.

However, the order was cancelled after [[New York City]] purchased the BMT in June 1940. The City's [[New York City Board of Transportation|Board of Transportation]], already the operator of the [[Independent Subway System]], was one of the most conservative transit operators in the [[United States of America|United States]], and had no interest in the former BMT's aggressive [[technology]] planning.\n\nFive more Bluebirds were in the process of construction at the time of cancellation, and the City decided to accept these, numbering them 8001\u20138005. They couldn't interoperate with unit 8000, which had no couplers or [[multiple unit]] trainline connections. Unit 8000 spent much of its service life on the [[BMT Franklin Avenue Line|Franklin Avenue Shuttle]], home of many pieces of orphaned equipment, while units 8001-8005 operated regularly on the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]. On occasion, they also operated in Brighton-Franklin Ave. Local service and on the Fourth Ave. Local. In those instances, it probably operated as an extra behind a regular interval.\n\nAfter delivery of the Bluebirds, New York City never again purchased any lightweight, articulated or PCC technology rail equipment, nor did it purchase equipment to sustain the lines and portions of the elevated system incapable of operating subway cars. Most of the elevated lines were dismantled between 1940 and 1975.\n\nFollowing their retirement, all of the Bluebirds were scrapped by 1957.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/theymovedthemillions3.html Excerpt from ''They Moved the Millions'', with an image of a Bluebird car]\n*[http://www.thejoekorner.com/cars/carsbmt.htm Table of BMT Pre-WWII Cars (including Bluebird 8000)]\n\n{{NYCS rolling stock}}\n\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1939]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway rolling stock]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation]]\n[[Category:Articulated passenger trains]]\n[[Category:1939 in rail transport]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:BMT_Bluebird_Compartment_Car.jpg|thumb|right|The BMT Bluebird Compartment Car stored in 36th Street Yard]]\nThe '''Bluebird''', formally dubbed '''Compartment Car''' by its purchaser, the [[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation]] (BMT), was an advanced design [[PCC streetcar|PCC]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] and [[elevated railway]] car built by the [[Clark Equipment Company]] from 1938 to 1940 and used on the [[New York City Subway]] system from 1939 to 1957.

In addition to quick acceleration and braking ({{convert|4|mph/s|km/h/s|abbr=on|disp=or}}), use of PCC technology meant that Bluebirds could share a significant parts and maintenance base with the [[Brooklyn]] transit company's planned PCC [[tram|trolley]] fleet, achieving economies of scale and efficiency.\n\nThe Bluebirds were built by [[Clark Equipment Company]] of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tmny.org/bluebird.html| title=\"Blue Bird\" train set at Clark's Battle Creek, Michigan, plant, 1939| website=Trolley Museum of New York| date=July 24, 2014| first=Evan| last=Jennings}}</ref> maker of PCC running gear. They were the only [[rapid transit]] cars ever built by Clark, and the only passenger rail equipment ever built by the company, other than one PCC streetcar.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tmny.org/tmny1000.html| title=Brooklyn & Queens Transit PCC 1000| website=Trolley Museum of New York| date=October 1, 2014| first=Evan| last=Jennings}}</ref>\n\n==Fleet history==\nSatisfied with tests on unit 8000, the BMT placed an order for an additional 50 units, which could replace 80 old elevated cars. However, the order was cancelled after [[New York City]] purchased the BMT in June 1940. The City's [[New York City Board of Transportation|Board of Transportation]], already the operator of the [[Independent Subway System]], was one of the most conservative transit operators in the [[United States of America|United States]], and had no interest in the former BMT's aggressive [[technology]] planning.\n\nFive more Bluebirds were in the process of construction at the time of cancellation, and the City decided to accept these, numbering them 8001-8005. They couldn't interoperate with unit 8000, which had no couplers or [[multiple unit]] trainline connections. Unit 8000 spent much of its service life on the [[BMT Franklin Avenue Line|Franklin Avenue Shuttle]], home of many pieces of orphaned equipment, while units 8001-8005 operated regularly on the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]. On occasion, they also operated in Brighton-Franklin Ave. Local service and on the Fourth Ave. Local. In those instances, it probably operated as an extra behind a regular interval.\n\nAfter delivery of the Bluebirds, New York City never again purchased any lightweight, articulated or PCC technology rail equipment, nor did it purchase equipment to sustain the lines and portions of the elevated system incapable of operating subway cars. Most of the elevated lines were dismantled between 1940 and 1975.\n\nFollowing their retirement, all of the Bluebirds were scrapped by 1957.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/theymovedthemillions3.html Excerpt from ''They Moved the Millions'', with an image of a Bluebird car]\n*[http://www.thejoekorner.com/cars/carsbmt.htm Table of BMT Pre-WWII Cars (including Bluebird 8000)]\n\n{{NYCS rolling stock}}\n\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1939]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway rolling stock]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation]]\n[[Category:Articulated passenger trains]]\n[[Category:1939 in rail transport]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFleet history:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 8001-8005 \u2192 8001\u20138005", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebird_Compartment_Car_(New_York_City_Subway_car)"}

The same ''Veja'' magazine reported that, with an Army colleague, he had plans to plant bombs in military units in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After Bolsonaro called the allegation \"a fantasy\", the magazine published, in its subsequent edition, sketches in which the plan was detailed.

According to this board, Bolsonaro had a \"serious personality deviation and a professional deformation\", \"lack of moral courage to leave the Army\" and \"lied throughout the process\" when denying frequent contacts with the ''Veja'' magazine. The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court. The [[General]] in charge of reporting the case voted for his acquittal, arguing that Bolsonaro had already been penalized for the initial article in ''Veja'', that there was no testimonial evidence of his plans to plant bombs and that there were \"deep contradictions in the four graphological exams\", two of which failed to conclude that Bolsonaro was indeed the author of the sketches.

The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court.

We need to adopt a rigid birth control policy. We can't make demagogic speeches any longer, proposing bills and means of government to support these poor people [who] are increasingly proliferating throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children, shouldn't have them. This is what I stand for and I'm not worried about getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to contain this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this [[Chamber of Deputies|Chamber]] only matters such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]], loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. Methods [of birth control] have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, are ignorant and have no means to control their offspring.
