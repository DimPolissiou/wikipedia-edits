After the events of ''Metal Gear Solid'', he helped Solid Snake form [[Philanthropy (Metal Gear)|Philanthropy]], a group whose main objective is to prevent proliferation of [[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]]-type weapons. Snake and Otacon infiltrate the military installations and facilities of the world, delving into their compounds through stealth and cyber hacking. In a sense, Snake is the brawn and Otacon is the brains behind \"Philanthropy.\"\n\nA devoted fan of [[anime]], Hal's chosen nickname is the short form of the [[Otaku]] Convention, with reference to [[Otakon]] held in [[Washington, D.C.]] each year. The name \"Hal\" is a direct reference to the computer [[HAL 9000]] from the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', one of several references to the film which is present in ''Metal Gear Solid''; in the Otacon ending of the game, Hal and Snake make direct comparisons to the film. Critical reception of Otacon has been positive, with praise being particularly directed towards his and Snake's friendship.\n\n==Concept and design==\n\"Hal\" is a tribute to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|year=2002|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|level=Making of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty}}</ref> Kojima states that he created Otacon as his way of glorifying the [[otaku]] stereotype by having a character who fights the terrorists with his intellect rather than his brawn.<ref name=mgsagavol1>{{cite video|title=Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1}}</ref> He added that the original idea for Otacon was to make him \"heavier, wearing a cap, and programming while eating a chocolate bar\".

When Hal was still young, Huey attempted using him as a test pilot for the [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Sahelanthropus|Metal Gear ST-84]], as the machine could only be piloted by a child. Strangelove vehemently opposed this, leading to an argument between Hal's parents and ultimately to his mother's death at his father's hands. Years later, Huey married a British woman named Julie Danziger with a child of her own ([[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Emma Emmerich|Emma]]). Hal and Emma were close, as they had no other friends. Hal was sexually abused by his stepmother, and she coerced him into keeping a brief affair. Upon learning this, Huey committed suicide by drowning himself in the family pool, and attempted to drown Emma as well. Emma expected Hal to save her, but he didn't know it was happening since at the time he was with his stepmother. After the incident, Emma became estranged from her stepbrother, blaming him for not saving her. Shortly afterwards, Hal ran away from home and didn't see any of his family members until several years later. Choosing not to continue school, he began to educate himself via the Internet. He became a big fan of [[anime]], and started calling himself Otacon, short for the \"[[Otaku]] Convention\", which he never misses. He [[matriculation|matriculated]] at [[MIT]] and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]]. During his college years, he was recruited by the [[FBI]]'s Engineering Research Facility, but was fired from his job after hacking into their classified database. Otacon was hired by Armstech, Inc. to be the lead engineer for the Metal Gear REX project.<ref>\"Snakes and Gears: A Metal Gear Overview,\" ''Game Informer'' 182 (June 2008): 108.</ref> He jumped at the chance to make an actual [[mecha]] type robot, which appears frequently in the anime he enjoys. He was led to believe that it was a mobile defense system, but in reality it was a nuclear [[doomsday weapon]].\n\nIn 2005, during the Shadow Moses incident (the events of ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''), Otacon encountered [[Solid Snake]] who had informed him of the true nature of Metal Gear REX. Devastated, Otacon realized that he had written yet another chapter in his family's dark history\u2014his grandfather had worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], and his father was born on the day of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing]]. Otacon had developed a strong attraction to [[FOXHOUND]] member [[Sniper Wolf]]. Distraught that Snake would have to kill her, Otacon eventually came to terms with her, himself, and his position in life. With Otacon's assistance, Snake was able to destroy REX and defeat the terrorist uprising. According to the in-universe novel ''In the Darkness of Shadow Moses: The Unofficial Truth'', Otacon had allegedly left for Great Britain after the events of the terrorist uprising to visit relatives.<ref>{{cite game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|developer=[[Konami|KCEJ]]|quote=\"[...]Dr. Hal Emmerich did not return to ArmsTech following his rescue from Shadow Moses.

The e-mail was actually a bait for [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#The Patriots|the Patriots]] to lure Solid Snake out of hiding and frame him for terrorism, by having Ocelot hijack RAY and place the blame on Snake with forged evidence. When the tanker was destroyed by Ocelot, Otacon took a boat and managed to save Snake, as well as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]]. Otacon was forced to fake Snake's death after he was framed by the Patriots. Using connections he had with an organization, he managed to steal [[Liquid Snake]]'s corpse (which was missing its right arm) and dumped it into the sea. He continued to manage Philanthropy's activities, while keeping Snake's survival a secret from the public. In 2009, he received another anonymous e-mail, this time from Liquid (while taking over Ocelot's mind), informing him about the development of Arsenal Gear in the Big Shell. When [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Solidus Snake|Solidus Snake]] seized the Big Shell, he infiltrated the facility with SEAL Team 10 to find Emma, who was among the hostages. He managed to be reunited with her, but she died shortly afterwards, due to stab wounds inflicted by [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Vamp|Vamp]]. Before her death, Emma admitted to always admiring Hal and wanting to follow in his footsteps. Despite falling into deep despair, Snake encouraged him to move on and rescue all the hostages held in the Big Shell. Apparently he was successful in this, and stays in contact to support [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] until he defeated Solidus. When Snake met Otacon at their hideout he was given the disk that contained the data of the Wisemen's Committee to look over, which included their names and whereabouts. After this (the ending note) Otacon told Snake about the information on the disc: the twelve Wisemen had been dead for about 100 years.\n\nOtacon appeared once more as Old Snake's support man in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', set in 2014. He and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Sunny|Sunny]] built a robotic companion to Snake called [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear Mk. II and Metal Gear Mk. III|Metal Gear Mk. II]], which he controlled remotely. The Mk. II was taken from a robotic character of the same name in ''[[Snatcher (video game)|Snatcher]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.konami.jp/kojima_pro/event2007/index-en.html |title=Kojima Productions event site 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-24 |work= }}</ref> He became romantically involved with [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Naomi Hunter|Naomi Hunter]] through the course of the story although he once again lost her upon her suicide, thus forcing him yet again to witness the death of a woman he cared about.

By the time of ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'' in 2018, Otacon is mentioned to have officially adopted Sunny.\n\nOutside of the ''Metal Gear'' series, Otacon made a guest appearance in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

This land became [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]]. Del Valle Airfield was activated on September 19, 1942 on {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} leased from the City of Austin. The name of the base was changed to Bergstrom Army Airfield (AAF) in March 1943, in honor of Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, a reservist in the [[19th Bombardment Group]], who was killed at [[Clark Field]], [[Philippines]] in 1941. He was the first Austinite killed in World War II. With the separation of the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Army]] in September 1947, the name again changed to Bergstrom Air Force Base. It would have this name until it was decommissioned in the early 1990s, with all military aviation ceasing in 1995, after more than 50 years.<ref name=\"ci.austin.tx.us\"/>\n\nAs Austin was quickly outgrowing the old [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]],{{fact|date=October 2019}} the city began considering options for a new airport as early as 1971, when the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] proposed that Austin and [[San Antonio]] build a joint regional airport. That idea was rejected, as few Austinites supported driving halfway to San Antonio on [[Interstate 35]] to catch a flight. Afterwards, the city submitted a proposal to the United States Air Force for joint use of Bergstrom Air Force Base in 1976. The Air Force rejected the proposal in 1978 as being too disruptive to its operations.\n\nIn the 1980s, neighborhoods around Mueller applied enough political pressure to force the city council to choose a site for a new airport from locations under consideration. In November 1987, voters approved a referendum designating a site near [[Manor, Texas|Manor]]. The city began acquiring the land, but faced lawsuits from the [[Sierra Club]] and others concerned about the Manor location and its potential environmental impact.<ref>{{cite news |title=Airport site stirs controversy |publisher=[[The Daily Texan]] |date=January 15, 1985}}</ref>\n\nThe plans to construct a new airport at the Manor location were abandoned in 1991 when the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] selected Bergstrom AFB for closure, and gave the nod to the city for the land and runways to be converted for use as a civilian airport. The USAF also agreed not to demolish the existing facilities, including the nearly-pristine main runway. The city council decided to abandon the original plan to build the new airport near Manor, and resolved instead to move the airport to the Bergstrom site. The City of Austin hired John Almond\u2014a civil engineer who had recently led the airport design team for the new airport expansion in [[San Jose, California]]\u2014as Project Director for the new $585&nbsp;million airport in Austin and to put together a team of engineers and contractors to accomplish the task.<ref name=\"austintexas1\">{{cite web |url=http://austintexas.gov/department/history-airport |title=History of the Airport |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |work=Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport |publisher=City of Austin |accessdate=June 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022081102/http://austintexas.gov/department/history-airport |archive-date=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The issue of a $400 million bond referendum for a new airport owned and operated by the city was put to a public vote in May 1993 with a campaign managed by local public affairs consultant Don Martin and then-Mayor [[List of mayors of Austin, Texas|Bruce Todd]] and was approved by 63% of the vote.

The tower when completed is behind Dallas and Houston as the tallest tower in the state.<ref name=\"tower\"/>\n\nBergstom AFB's main runway, 17R/35L, was kept intact along with most of its taxiways, as its high weight rating and long length would facilitate eventual service by large long-range airliners while reducing construction costs. Bergstom's original secondary runway, 17L/35R, was closed and partially demolished to allow new sections of taxiway to directly connect the main runway to the terminal complex. A replacement 9,000-foot 17L/35R was built to the east of the terminal site, along with a general aviation complex to the inside of its southern half. Most of the existing military buildings including the original control tower were demolished and cleared to make way for the new terminal and substantial parking facilities, though a hangar complex and parking tarmac to the south was retained, along with a section of tarmac to the northeast of the primary runway which became the foundation for ABIA's freight terminal. A few other existing jet bridges were converted to access roads for ground vehicles, while the family housing area to the northwest would be leveled but some of the roads kept for a [[Texas Department of Transportation]] service facility. A large complex of [[Travis County]] facilities, including the county correctional facility and sheriff's training academy, already existed just off of the original base; these facilities were left untouched.\n\nBergstrom had the designator BSM until Mueller's final closure in 1999, when it took Mueller's IATA code of AUS.<ref name=\"austintexas1\"/> Initial issues with flight scheduling and routing led to proposed plans to keep Mueller operating in parallel with Bergstrom for a few weeks, but residents near Mueller blocked such efforts by appealing to the FAA, who refused to delay the transfer of the AUS [[Location identifier|LID]] or to issue a new airport code for Mueller.

A consolidated rental car facility that houses counter, pick up, drop off, service and cleaning facilities is connected via walkway to the terminal and parking garage. The addition of the rental car facility, completed in October 2015, allowed the 900 parking spaces previously used for rental cars on the top floor of the parking garage to be converted to additional close-in short-term parking.\n\n===South Terminal===\nA secondary terminal known as the South Terminal is primarily used by ultra low-cost carriers Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines. The South Terminal is accessed from a separate entrance on the south side of the airport perimeter from Burleson Road; it cannot be accessed from either the main airport entrance from SH 71 or the Barbara Jordan terminal except by completely exiting the airport grounds. A shuttle runs between the two terminals. The facility has a retro look and three passenger gates without airbridges\u2014passengers walk under a covered walkway to board the aircraft by stairs.\n\nThe South Terminal was originally commissioned as a joint venture with the [[Mexico|Mexican]]-based low-cost airline [[VivaAerobus]], which commenced service from Austin on May 1, 2008. The 30,000 square foot building, which was part of the original Air Force Base facilities, was renovated to meet the standards of a no-frills carrier. VivaAerobus's service was short-lived due to an epidemic of swine flu in [[Mexico]] in the spring of 2009 that resulted in high cancellation and no-show rates among leisure travelers, the airline's target demographic. Facing steep losses, the carrier terminated all service to the United States on June 1, 2009. The South Terminal's operator announced the closure of the facility at the same time.<ref>[http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/05/16/0516aerobus.html VivaAerobus to cease operations out of Austin\u2013Bergstrom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519154252/http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/05/16/0516aerobus.html |date=May 19, 2009 }} Accessed May 16, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, the [[Austin]] City Council authorized a 30-year lease on the facility to LoneStar Airport Holdings, LLC, which proposed relocating the ultra-low-cost carriers Allegiant Airlines and Frontier Airlines from the Barbara Jordan Terminal. Both carriers had expressed interest in expanding service to Austin but faced physical constraints as the main terminal neared capacity during peak hours.

This land became [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]]. Del Valle Airfield was activated on September 19, 1942 on {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} leased from the City of Austin. The name of the base was changed to Bergstrom Army Airfield (AAF) in March 1943, in honor of Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, a reservist in the [[19th Bombardment Group]], who was killed at [[Clark Field]], [[Philippines]] in 1941. He was the first Austinite killed in World War II. With the separation of the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Army]] in September 1947, the name again changed to Bergstrom Air Force Base. It would have this name until it was decommissioned in the early 1990s, with all military aviation ceasing in 1995, after more than 50 years.<ref name=\"ci.austin.tx.us\"/>\n\nAs Austin was quickly outgrowing the old [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]],{{fact|date=October 2019}} the city began considering options for a new airport as early as 1971, when the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] proposed that Austin and [[San Antonio]] build a joint regional airport. That idea was rejected, as few Austinites supported driving halfway to San Antonio on [[Interstate 35]] to catch a flight. Afterwards, the city submitted a proposal to the United States Air Force for joint use of Bergstrom Air Force Base in 1976. The Air Force rejected the proposal in 1978 as being too disruptive to its operations.\n\nIn the 1980s, neighborhoods around Mueller applied enough political pressure to force the city council to choose a site for a new airport from locations under consideration. In November 1987, voters approved a referendum designating a site near [[Manor, Texas|Manor]]. The city began acquiring the land, but faced lawsuits from the [[Sierra Club]] and others concerned about the Manor location and its potential environmental impact.<ref>{{cite news |title=Airport site stirs controversy |publisher=[[The Daily Texan]] |date=January 15, 1985}}</ref>\n\nThe plans to construct a new airport at the Manor location were abandoned in 1991 when the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] selected Bergstrom AFB for closure, and gave the nod to the city for the land and runways to be converted for use as a civilian airport. The USAF also agreed not to demolish the existing facilities, including the nearly-pristine main runway. The city council decided to abandon the original plan to build the new airport near Manor, and resolved instead to move the airport to the Bergstrom site. The City of Austin hired John Almond\u2014a civil engineer who had recently led the airport design team for the new airport expansion in [[San Jose, California]]\u2014as Project Director for the new $585&nbsp;million airport in Austin and to put together a team of engineers and contractors to accomplish the task.<ref name=\"austintexas1\">{{cite web |url=http://austintexas.gov/department/history-airport |title=History of the Airport |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |work=Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport |publisher=City of Austin |accessdate=June 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022081102/http://austintexas.gov/department/history-airport |archive-date=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The issue of a $400 million bond referendum for a new airport owned and operated by the city was put to a public vote in May 1993 with a campaign managed by local public affairs consultant Don Martin and then-Mayor [[List of mayors of Austin, Texas|Bruce Todd]] and was approved by 63% of the vote.

The tower when completed is behind Dallas and Houston as the tallest tower in the state.<ref name=\"tower\"/>\n\nBergstom AFB's main runway, 17R/35L, was kept intact along with most of its taxiways, as its high weight rating and long length would facilitate eventual service by large long-range airliners while reducing construction costs. Bergstom's original secondary runway, 17L/35R, was closed and partially demolished to allow new sections of taxiway to directly connect the main runway to the terminal complex. A replacement 9,000-foot 17L/35R was built to the east of the terminal site, along with a general aviation complex to the inside of its southern half. Most of the existing military buildings including the original control tower were demolished and cleared to make way for the new terminal and substantial parking facilities, though a hangar complex and parking tarmac to the south was retained, along with a section of tarmac to the northeast of the primary runway which became the foundation for ABIA's freight terminal. A few other existing jet bridges were converted to access roads for ground vehicles, while the family housing area to the northwest would be leveled but some of the roads kept for a [[Texas Department of Transportation]] service facility. A large complex of [[Travis County]] facilities, including the county correctional facility and sheriff's training academy, already existed just off of the original base; these facilities were left untouched.\n\nBergstrom had the designator BSM until Mueller's final closure in 1999, when it took Mueller's IATA code of AUS.<ref name=\"austintexas1\"/> Initial issues with flight scheduling and routing led to proposed plans to keep Mueller operating in parallel with Bergstrom for a few weeks, but residents near Mueller blocked such efforts by appealing to the FAA, who refused to delay the transfer of the AUS [[Location identifier|LID]] or to issue a new airport code for Mueller.

A consolidated rental car facility that houses counter, pick up, drop off, service and cleaning facilities is connected via walkway to the terminal and parking garage. The addition of the rental car facility, completed in October 2015, allowed the 900 parking spaces previously used for rental cars on the top floor of the parking garage to be converted to additional close-in short-term parking.\n\n===South Terminal===\nA secondary terminal known as the South Terminal is primarily used by ultra low-cost carriers Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines. The South Terminal is accessed from a separate entrance on the south side of the airport perimeter from Burleson Road; it cannot be accessed from either the main airport entrance from SH 71 or the Barbara Jordan terminal except by completely exiting the airport grounds. A shuttle runs between the two terminals. The facility has a retro look and three passenger gates without airbridges\u2014passengers walk under a covered walkway to board the aircraft by stairs.\n\nThe South Terminal was originally commissioned as a joint venture with the [[Mexico|Mexican]]-based low-cost airline [[VivaAerobus]], which commenced service from Austin on May 1, 2008. The 30,000 square foot building, which was part of the original Air Force Base facilities, was renovated to meet the standards of a no-frills carrier. VivaAerobus's service was short-lived due to an epidemic of swine flu in [[Mexico]] in the spring of 2009 that resulted in high cancellation and no-show rates among leisure travelers, the airline's target demographic. Facing steep losses, the carrier terminated all service to the United States on June 1, 2009. The South Terminal's operator announced the closure of the facility at the same time.<ref>[http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/05/16/0516aerobus.html VivaAerobus to cease operations out of Austin\u2013Bergstrom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519154252/http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/05/16/0516aerobus.html |date=May 19, 2009 }} Accessed May 16, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, the [[Austin]] City Council authorized a 30-year lease on the facility to LoneStar Airport Holdings, LLC, which proposed relocating the ultra-low-cost carriers Allegiant Airlines and Frontier Airlines from the Barbara Jordan Terminal.
