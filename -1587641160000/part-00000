{"title_page": "I Drove All Night", "text_new": "{{short description|1989 single by Cyndi Lauper}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n'''\"I Drove All Night\"''' is a [[song]] written and composed by American songwriters [[Billy Steinberg]] and [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] and recorded by American singer [[Cyndi Lauper]]. The song was originally intended for [[Roy Orbison]], who recorded it in 1987, the year before his death, but his version was not released until 1992, after Lauper's version became a top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1989. The song has been covered most notable by [[Celine Dion]] who got it to number 1 on the Canadian and Quebec charts and number 7 on the U.S. [[Adult Contemporary]] chart in 2003.\n\n==Cyndi Lauper version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Drove All Night\n| cover      = Cyndiidan4978108562745850.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Cyndi Lauper]]\n| album      = [[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)|A Night to Remember]]\n| B-side     = \"[[Maybe He'll Know]]\" <small>([[Remix]])</small>\n| released   = 4 April 1989\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1987\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Pop rock]]\n| length     = 4:11\n| label      = [[Epic Records]]\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Billy Steinberg]]|[[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]]}}\n| producer   = {{hlist|Cyndi Lauper|Lennie Petze}}\n| prev_title = [[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\n| prev_year  = 1988\n| next_title = [[My First Night Without You]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n| misc       = {{Audio sample\n | type        = single\n | file        = Cyndi Lauper - I Drove All Night.ogg\n | description = I Drove All Night\n}}\n{{External music video|{{YouTube|2y1TZXc5DiY|\"I Drove All Night\"}}}}\n}}\n\"I Drove All Night\" was recorded by [[Cyndi Lauper]] for ''[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)|A Night to Remember]]'', her third solo album. Lauper said she wanted to do it because she liked the idea \"of a woman driving, of a woman in control.\" The song was a top 10 pop hit in the United States\u2014and was her last U.S. top 40 single to date, peaking at number 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and also a hit in other countries. It received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]]. The music video for \"I Drove All Night\", directed by Scott Kalvert and [[Cyndi Lauper]], features shots of an antique car, Lauper's characteristically manic dancing, and movie film projected onto Lauper's naked body.\n\n===Formats and track listings===\n'''7\" / Cassette / US 3\" CD / Japan 3\" CD'''\n# \"I Drove All Night\" -

He sent a copy of [[Roy Orbison]]'s version of \"I Drove All Night\" to her record company, who loved it and had Dion record it with Swedish producer [[Peer Astrom]].<ref name=songfacts>{{cite web|title=I Drove All Night by Roy Orbison|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3738|work=Songfacts|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> She used the song in her [[A New Day...|Las Vegas show]] and it became the centerpiece of the Chrysler campaign.

Born to a family of low status in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] commander of the Emperor [[Carus]]'s army. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus's surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]].\n\nDiocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian reigned in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]], and [[Maximian]] reigned in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]]. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors, under himself and Maximian respectively. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or \"rule of four\", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favourable peace.\n\nDiocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Sirmium]], and [[Trier|Trevorum]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.\n\nNot all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|tetrarchic system collapsed]] after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303\u2013312), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official [[persecution of Christianity]], failed to eliminate Christianity in the empire; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Despite these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]\n\nDiocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.<ref name=BIRTH/> His parents gave him the Greek name Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.<ref>Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.</ref> The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate.

One individual, [[Peter Cubicularius]], was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were poured in his wounds, and he was [[Boiling to death|slowly boiled]] over an open flame.

On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign ({{lang|lat|vicennalia}}), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls \"licentious familiarity\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92.</ref> The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,<ref name=\"tkuqen\">Potter, 341.</ref> Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24\u201325.</ref> There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius's account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.</ref>\n\nFrom Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius's company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.<ref name=tkuqen/> He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November 304, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304\u20135 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumours alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, it appeared that he had finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it recovered after public declarations that Diocletian was still alive. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref>\n\nGalerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1\u20137; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref> On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201327; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60; Odahl, 69\u201372; Potter, 341\u201342.</ref>\n\nMost in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of reigning emperors, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had travelled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201326.</ref> In Lactantius's account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2\u20136; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were declared caesars. Maximinus appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.<ref>Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60\u201361; Odahl, 72\u201374; Southern, 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and death ===\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|left|Modern depiction of Diocletian in retirement]]\n\nDiocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].\n\nMaximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref> Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be Augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius's usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>\n\nHe lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens.

Aurelian's achievements were ignored, the revolt of Carausius was backdated to the reign of Gallienus, and it was implied that the tetrarchs engineered Aurelian's defeat of the [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrenes]]; the period between Gallienus and Diocletian was effectively erased.

These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect \u2013 although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general<ref>Williams, 107/108.</ref> \u2013 but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.<ref>Williams, 110.</ref>\n\nAltogether, Diocletian effected a large increase in the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.3, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.</ref> The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the [[civil service]] doubled from 15,000 to 30,000.<ref name=\"civil\">Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 19.</ref> The classicist [[Roger S.

(By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century [[Song dynasty]] China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.)

The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per [[Roman diocese|diocese]] depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13\u201315,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their ''comitatus'', with the praetorian prefects, or with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.<ref>Roger S.

The ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]'', built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of [[Bostra]], is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts \u2013 defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons \u2013 followed by further fortifications in the rear.<ref>Luttwak, 167; Campbell, \"The Army\" (CAH), 124\u201326; Southern, 154\u201355.

The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235\u2013285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') \u2013 with one iugerum equal to approximately 0.65 acres \u2013 and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20>Treadgold, 20.</ref> The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.<ref name=SSC159/> Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20/>{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'').

Rates shifted to take inflation into account.<ref name=TBSS20/> In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref>Potter, 333.</ref>\n\nItaly, which had long been exempt from taxes, was included in the tax system from 290/291 as a diocesis.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9, 288; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 28\u201329; Southern, 159.</ref> The city of Rome itself, however, remained exempt; the \"regions\" (i.e., provinces) South of Rome (generally called \"suburbicarian\", as opposed to the Northern, \"annonaria\" region) seem to have been relatively less taxed, in what probably was a sop offered to the great senatorial families and their landed properties.<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''l\"Empire Romain'', 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nDiocletian's edicts emphasized the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public.<ref>Williams, 125.</ref> The position of ''decurion'', member of the city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall in the amount of tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.<ref name=sfirim/> By 300, civilians across the empire complained that there were more tax collectors than there were people to pay taxes.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=25}}\n\n====Currency and inflation====\n[[File:Edict on Maximum Prices Diocletian piece in Berlin.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (301), on display in [[Berlin]]]]\n[[File:Prices edict Greek.jpg|thumb|Part of the prices edict in Greek in its original area built into a medieval church, Geraki, Greece]]\n\nAurelian's attempt to reform the currency had failed; the denarius was dead.<ref name=SSC160>Southern, 160.</ref> Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces.<ref name=POTBAY392>Potter, 392.</ref> The new system consisted of five coins: the ''aureus''/''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the ''[[argenteus]]'', a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the ''[[follis]]'', sometimes referred to as the ''laureatus'' A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the ''radiatus'', a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the ''laureatus'' B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound.<ref>Potter, 392\u201393.</ref>{{refn|The ''[[denarius]]'' was dropped from the Imperial mints,<ref name=SSC160/> but the values of new coins continued to be measured in reference to it.<ref name=POTBAY392/>|group=\"Note\"}} Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).<ref name=CAS76>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176.</ref>\n\nBy 301, however, the system was in trouble, strained by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his ''Edict on Coinage'', an act re-tariffing all debts so that the ''[[nummus]]'', the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much.<ref>Potter, 334, 393; Southern, 160.</ref> In the edict, preserved in an inscription from the city of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]] (near [[Geyre]], Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards.<ref name=POTBAY33435>Potter, 334\u201335.</ref> It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency.<ref>Potter, 393.</ref> This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (''Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium'') was issued two to three months after the coinage edict,<ref name=SSC160/> somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301.<ref name=POTBAY33435/> The best-preserved Latin inscription surviving from the [[Greek East]],<ref>Potter, 336.</ref> the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone.<ref>Southern, 160, 339.</ref> In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177\u201378; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.</ref>\n\nIn the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was \"an act of economic lunacy\".<ref>Potter, 335.</ref> The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics \u2013 perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\", 42 and 44</ref>\n\nThere is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\",44</ref> Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178.</ref> The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177.</ref> widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.<ref>Potter, 336; Southern, 161.</ref> Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6\u20137, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.</ref> and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.<ref>Potter, 336; Williams, 131\u201332.</ref>\n\n==== Social and professional mobility====\nPartly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.<ref>\"Late Antinquity\" by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.</ref> Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.<ref>Christol & Nony, 241.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that \"It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.\"<ref>Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.</ref> Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.<ref>Williams, 228\u201329.</ref> Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.<ref>Williams, 196\u201398.</ref> Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:<ref>Williams, 204.</ref> the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.<ref>Williams, 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nConstantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.<ref>Williams, 207\u20138.</ref> Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.<ref>Williams, 208.</ref> The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Williams, 218\u201319.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.\n\nThe ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: ''anno Diocletiani''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.\n\n''[[Dukljan]]'', a major villain in [[Serbian mythology]] who is presented as the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |title=\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043be\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u045b\u0430 |author=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2007-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172046/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead |author-link=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 }}</ref> is considered to be a mythological reflection of the historical Diocletian.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| Car | | | | | | | | | | Dio |Car=''previous''<br>[[Carus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-283|Dio=[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|20px]]<br>Diocletian<br>Roman Emperor<br>284-305<br><small>\u221e [[Prisca (empress)|Prisca]]}}\n{{tree chart| |!| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |!| }}\n{{tree chart| Can | | sis | | Gal |~| GVa | | Man |~|~|~| Eut |~|~|~| Afr |Can=[[Carinus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-284|GVa=[[Galeria Valeria]]|Gal=[[Galerius]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>305-311|sis=sister|Man=''next''<br>[[Maximian]]<br>co-emperor 285-286<br>Emperor of the West 286-305|Eut=[[Eutropia]]|Afr=[[Afranius Hannibalianus]]}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | Ma2 | | Val |~| Mus | | |!| | | Hel |~| CCh |~| FMT |Val=[[Valeria Maximilla]]|Ma2=[[Maximinus II]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>310-313|FMT=(?)

Born to a family of low status in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] commander of the Emperor [[Carus]]'s army. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus's surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]].\n\nDiocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian reigned in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]], and [[Maximian]] reigned in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]]. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors, under himself and Maximian respectively. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or \"rule of four\", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favourable peace.\n\nDiocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Sirmium]], and [[Trier|Trevorum]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.\n\nNot all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|tetrarchic system collapsed]] after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303\u2013312), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official [[persecution of Christianity]], failed to eliminate Christianity in the empire; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Despite these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]\n\nDiocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.<ref name=BIRTH/> His parents gave him the Greek name Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.<ref>Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.</ref> The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate.

On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign ({{lang|lat|vicennalia}}), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls \"licentious familiarity\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92.</ref> The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,<ref name=\"tkuqen\">Potter, 341.</ref> Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24\u201325.</ref> There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius's account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.</ref>\n\nFrom Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius's company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.<ref name=tkuqen/> He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November 304, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304\u20135 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumours alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, it appeared that he had finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it recovered after public declarations that Diocletian was still alive. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref>\n\nGalerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1\u20137; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref> On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201327; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60; Odahl, 69\u201372; Potter, 341\u201342.</ref>\n\nMost in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of reigning emperors, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had travelled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201326.</ref> In Lactantius's account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2\u20136; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were declared caesars. Maximinus appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.<ref>Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60\u201361; Odahl, 72\u201374; Southern, 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and death ===\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|left|Modern depiction of Diocletian in retirement]]\n\nDiocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].\n\nMaximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref> Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be Augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius's usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>\n\nHe lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 311.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius's \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius's defeat in October 312.

These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect \u2013 although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general<ref>Williams, 107/108.</ref> \u2013 but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.<ref>Williams, 110.</ref>\n\nAltogether, Diocletian effected a large increase in the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.3, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.</ref> The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the [[civil service]] doubled from 15,000 to 30,000.<ref name=\"civil\">Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 19.</ref> The classicist [[Roger S.

(By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century [[Song dynasty]] China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50\u201365&nbsp;million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per [[Roman diocese|diocese]] depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13\u201315,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their ''comitatus'', with the praetorian prefects, or with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.<ref>Roger S.

Rescripts, authoritative interpretations issued by the emperor in response to demands from disputants in both public and private cases, were a common duty of second- and third-century emperors.

The [[Devil's Dykes]], for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most that can be said about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] along the [[Lake Constance]]-[[Basel]] and the Rhine\u2013[[Iller]]\u2013Danube line),<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 166</ref> on the Danube- where a new line of forts on the far side of the river, the ''Ripa Sarmatica'', was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses<ref>Edward Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire''.

Beyond that, much discussion is speculative and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources.

The ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]'', built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of [[Bostra]], is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts \u2013 defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons \u2013 followed by further fortifications in the rear.<ref>Luttwak, 167; Campbell, \"The Army\" (CAH), 124\u201326; Southern, 154\u201355.

The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235\u2013285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') \u2013 with one iugerum equal to approximately 0.65 acres \u2013 and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20>Treadgold, 20.</ref> The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.<ref name=SSC159/> Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20/>{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'').

Landowners of senatorial rank were able to commute the tax with a payment in gold (the ''aurum tironicum'').<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.

The government's response was to issue a price freeze.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (''Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium'') was issued two to three months after the coinage edict,<ref name=SSC160/> somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301.<ref name=POTBAY33435/> The best-preserved Latin inscription surviving from the [[Greek East]],<ref>Potter, 336.</ref> the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone.<ref>Southern, 160, 339.</ref> In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177\u201378; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.</ref>\n\nIn the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was \"an act of economic lunacy\".<ref>Potter, 335.</ref> The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics \u2013 perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\", 42 and 44</ref>\n\nThere is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\",44</ref> Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178.</ref> The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177.</ref> widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.<ref>Potter, 336; Southern, 161.</ref> Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6\u20137, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.</ref> and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.<ref>Potter, 336; Williams, 131\u201332.</ref>\n\n==== Social and professional mobility====\nPartly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.<ref>\"Late Antinquity\" by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.</ref> Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.<ref>Christol & Nony, 241.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that \"It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.\"<ref>Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.</ref> Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.<ref>Williams, 228\u201329.</ref> Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.<ref>Williams, 196\u201398.</ref> Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:<ref>Williams, 204.</ref> the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.<ref>Williams, 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nConstantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.<ref>Williams, 207\u20138.</ref> Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.<ref>Williams, 208.</ref> The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Williams, 218\u201319.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.\n\nThe ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: ''anno Diocletiani''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.\n\n''[[Dukljan]]'', a major villain in [[Serbian mythology]] who is presented as the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |title=\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043be\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u045b\u0430 |author=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2007-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172046/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead |author-link=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 }}</ref> is considered to be a mythological reflection of the historical Diocletian.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| Car | | | | | | | | | | Dio |Car=''previous''<br>[[Carus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-283|Dio=[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|20px]]<br>Diocletian<br>Roman Emperor<br>284-305<br><small>\u221e [[Prisca]]}}\n{{tree chart| |!| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |!| }}\n{{tree chart| Can | | sis | | Gal |~| GVa | | Man |~|~|~| Eut |~|~|~| Afr |Can=[[Carinus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-284|GVa=[[Galeria Valeria]]|Gal=[[Galerius]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>305-311|sis=sister|Man=''next''<br>[[Maximian]]<br>co-emperor 285-286<br>Emperor of the West 286-305|Eut=[[Eutropia]]|Afr=[[Afranius Hannibalianus]]}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{tree chart| | | | | Ma2 | | Val |~| Mus | | |!| | | Hel |~| CCh |~| FMT |Val=[[Valeria Maximilla]]|Ma2=[[Maximinus II]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>310-313|FMT=(?)

Instead, it is the largest present part of the [[supercontinent cycle]].\n\nThe oldest part of Afro-Eurasia is probably the [[Kaapvaal Craton]], which together with [[Madagascar]] and parts of [[India]] and western [[Australia]] formed part of the first supercontinent [[Vaalbara]] or [[Ur (continent)|Ur]] around 3&nbsp;[[gigaannum|billion years ago]]. It has made up parts of [[list of supercontinents|every supercontinent since]]. At the breakup of [[Pangaea]] around 200&nbsp;[[megaannum|million years ago]], the [[North American Plate|North American]] and [[Eurasian Plate]]s together formed [[Laurasia]] while the [[African Plate]] remained in [[Gondwana]], from which the [[Indian Plate]] split off. This impacted southern Asia around 50&nbsp;million years ago and began the formation of the [[Himalayas]]. (Around the same time, it also [[Indo-Australian Plate|fused]] with the [[Australian Plate]].) The [[Arabian Plate]] broke off of Africa around [[Oligocene|30&nbsp;million years ago]] and impacted the [[Iranian Plate]] [[Miocene|between 19 and 12&nbsp;million years ago]], ultimately forming the [[Alborz Mountains|Alborz]] and [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]] chains of [[Iranian Plate]]. After this initial connection of Afro-Eurasia, the [[Betic corridor]] along the [[Gibraltar Arc]] closed [[Messinian|a little less than 6&nbsp;million years ago]], fusing Northwest Africa and Iberia together. This led to the nearly complete [[desiccation]] of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[Messinian salinity crisis]]. Eurasia and Africa were then again separated: the [[Zanclean Flood]] [[Zanclean|around 5.33&nbsp;million years ago]] refilled the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the [[Red Sea Rift|Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Suez Rift]]s further divided Africa from the Arabian Plate.\n\nToday, Africa is now joined to Asia only by a narrow [[land bridge]] (which has been split by the [[Suez Canal]] at the [[Isthmus of Suez]]) and remains separated from Europe by the Straits of Gibraltar and [[Strait of Sicily|Sicily]].

A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Brewer is the fourth woman, and was the third consecutive woman, to serve as Governor of Arizona. Brewer became governor of Arizona as part of the [[line of succession]], as determined by the [[Arizona Constitution]], when Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] resigned to become [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|secretary of Homeland Security]]. Brewer had served as [[Secretary of State of Arizona|secretary of state of Arizona]] from January 2003 to January 2009.\n\nBorn in [[California]], Brewer attended [[Glendale Community College (Arizona)|Glendale Community College]], from where she received a radiological technologist certificate; she has never earned a college degree. She served as a State Representative and State Senator for Arizona from 1983 to 1996. Brewer also served as Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors before running for Arizona Secretary of State in 2002.\n\nAs governor, Brewer signed the [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]]. The act makes it a state [[misdemeanor]] crime for an immigrant to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, authorizes state and local law enforcement of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[immigration law]]s, and cracks down on those sheltering, hiring and transporting undocumented immigrants.

Brewer would go on to serve in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] for three years, from 1983 to 1987, before deciding to run for the [[Arizona Senate]], where she would serve from 1987 to 1996. As state senator, Brewer sought legislation with the intention of creating an office of lieutenant governor in the state, arguing that holding the office of Secretary of State does not make a candidate qualified for governor, and that the office should be filled by a member of the same party, should a vacancy arise.<ref name=\"about\"/> During her last three years as a state senator, she held the senior leadership position of [[majority whip]].<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn 1996 Brewer ran for chairman of the [[Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Ed King, and served for six years on the board.

Brewer ran against Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio in the primary race. Brewer won by a narrow margin of just 23,000 votes.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAs Secretary of State, Brewer instituted a vote-by-fax program for overseas military troops, which would later be adopted by other municipalities, including [[San Francisco]].

Since Arizona has no lieutenant governor, the Secretary of State stands first in the line of succession if he or she holds that post as a result of an election. Despite her earlier quarrels with the line of succession while serving in the State Senate, Brewer was sworn in as governor after Napolitano resigned from her position on January 21, 2009. She became Arizona's fourth [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] and its third consecutive female governor.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn her inaugural address, Brewer promised to keep taxes low in Arizona, in an attempt to attract business from other states, including [[California]].

A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Brewer is the fourth woman, and was the third consecutive woman, to serve as Governor of Arizona. Brewer became governor of Arizona as part of the [[line of succession]], as determined by the [[Arizona Constitution]], when Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] resigned to become [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|secretary of Homeland Security]]. Brewer had served as [[Secretary of State of Arizona|secretary of state of Arizona]] from January 2003 to January 2009.\n\nBorn in [[California]], Brewer attended [[Glendale Community College (Arizona)|Glendale Community College]], from where she received a radiological technologist certificate; she has never earned a college degree. She served as a State Representative and State Senator for Arizona from 1983 to 1996. Brewer also served as Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors before running for Arizona Secretary of State in 2002.\n\nAs governor, Brewer signed the [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]]. The act makes it a state [[misdemeanor]] crime for an immigrant to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, authorizes state and local law enforcement of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[immigration law]]s, and cracks down on those sheltering, hiring and transporting undocumented immigrants. Brewer sought and was [[2010 Arizona gubernatorial election|elected]] to a full term as Governor of Arizona in 2010.\n\n==Early life, education, and family==\n{{Conservatism US}}\nBrewer was born Janice Kay Drinkwine on September 26, 1944, in [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], the daughter of Edna C.

Brewer would go on to serve in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] for three years, from 1983 to 1987, before deciding to run for the [[Arizona Senate]], where she would serve from 1987 to 1996. As state senator, Brewer sought legislation with the intention of creating an office of lieutenant governor in the state, arguing that holding the office of Secretary of State does not make a candidate qualified for governor, and that the office should be filled by a member of the same party, should a vacancy arise.<ref name=\"about\"/> During her last three years as a state senator, she held the senior leadership position of [[majority whip]].<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn 1996 Brewer ran for chairman of the [[Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Ed King, and served for six years on the board. She inherited a debt of $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Secretary of State of Arizona===\n[[File:Jan Brewer 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|Secretary of State]]\nIn early 2002, Brewer created a campaign committee to run for the office of [[Secretary of State of Arizona]], to replace outgoing Arizona Secretary of State [[Betsey Bayless]]. Brewer ran against Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio in the primary race. Brewer won by a narrow margin of just 23,000 votes.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAs Secretary of State, Brewer instituted a vote-by-fax program for overseas military troops, which would later be adopted by other municipalities, including [[San Francisco]]. Brewer also helped marshal changes brought about by [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)|Arizona Proposition 200]], which required citizens in the state to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote or applying for public benefits.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Governor of Arizona===\n\nGovernor [[Janet Napolitano]] was selected by President [[Barack Obama]] to serve as the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] in the [[United States Cabinet]]. Since Arizona has no lieutenant governor, the Secretary of State stands first in the line of succession if he or she holds that post as a result of an election. Despite her earlier quarrels with the line of succession while serving in the State Senate, Brewer was sworn in as governor after Napolitano resigned from her position on January 21, 2009. She became Arizona's fourth [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] and its third consecutive female governor.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn her inaugural address, Brewer promised to keep taxes low in Arizona, in an attempt to attract business from other states, including [[California]].
