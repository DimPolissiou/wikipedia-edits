While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Borkin|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|url=https://archive.org/details/crimepunishmento0000bork|url-access=registration|location=New York City|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

The mechanical means of mass killing at Jasenovac initially included the use of gas vans and later Zyklon B in stationary gas chambers. The Jasenovac guards were also reported to have cremated living inmates in the crematorium. A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates of the number of people who died at the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

Despite the lethal effects of carbon monoxide, this was seen as unsuitable for use in the East due to the cost of transporting the carbon monoxide in cylinders.<ref name = \"warning\"/>\n\nEach extermination camp operated differently, yet each had designs for quick and efficient industrialized killing. While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Borkin|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|url=https://archive.org/details/crimepunishmento0000bork|url-access=registration|location=New York City|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

[they] found the courage to joke with the children, to encourage them, despite the mortal terror visible in their own eyes\".

A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates of the number of people who died at the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.
