Both Radha and Krishna are the main characters of the ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' by Jayadeva Gosvami.<ref name=mmwradha/>\n\nHit Harivansh's and Swami Haridas' books consider Radha the main deity. Here, Radha is not an avatar of Laxmi but a form of Bhagavan Shri Krishna Himself. In the ''Devi Bhagavat'' and ''Brahma Vaivarta Purana,'' Radha is given as the source of infinite Laxmis, Gopis, and the mother of infinite souls.\n\nThe ''Narada-pancaratra'' states, \"Radha is Gokulesvari, the full embodiment of spontaneous love and the personification of mahabhava [the highest spiritual state]. Bhagavan Sri Krishna, who is the supreme Isvara of all existence and the God among gods, is attained by Her mercy. Sri Radha is Krsna\u2019s internal potency, and She performs worship of Her most beloved Sri Krsna with the entire wealth of Her devotion and service.\"\n\nIn ''Sammohana-tantra,'' Durga Devi says, \"The name Durga, by which I am known, is Her name. The qualities for which I am famous are Her qualities. The majesty with which I am resplendent is Her majesty. That Maha-Laksmi, Sri Radha, is nondifferent from Sri Krsna. She is His dearmost sweetheart and the crest-jewel of His beloveds.\"\n\nIn Caitanya Charitamrta (Adi-Lila 4.56), Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami says, \"''Radha Krishna Ek Atma, Dui Dui Dehadari, Anyaoone Vilase Rasasvadana Kori\".'' This means that both Radha and Krishna are one soul who take the form of two individual bodies so that they can cherish different mood of love (rasa).<ref>Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami, [https://vrajvrindavan.com/radha/ R\u0101dh\u0101], ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita|Caitanya Caritamrta]]'' Adi-Lila 4.56</ref>\n\nJagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj elaborately described the virtue of Radha and has given a brief description of Shri Radha in his lectures and ''Kirtans''.

The Gaudiya tradition focuses upon ''parakiya-rasa'' as the highest form of love, wherein Radha and Krishna share thoughts even through separation.

Other [[gopi]]s are usually considered to be self-willing maidservants (Sevika) of Radha. Radharani's superiority is seen in Krishna's flute, which repeats the name Radha. Between Radha and Rukmini, Radha is superior.\n\nRadha's connection to Krishna is of two types: ''svakiya-rasa'' (married relationship) and ''parakiya-rasa'' (a relationship signified with eternal mental \"love\"). The Gaudiya tradition focuses upon ''parakiya-rasa'' as the highest form of love, wherein Radha and Krishna share thoughts even through separation. The love the gopis feel for Krishna is also described in this esoteric manner as the highest platform of spontaneous love of God, and not of a sexual nature.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Nimbarka===\n\n[[Nimbarka]] was the first well known [[Vaishnava]] scholar whose theology centered on goddess Radha.<ref name=Singh2004>{{cite journal | author = Singh, K.B. | year = 2004 | title = Manipur Vaishnavism: A Sociological Interpretat1on | journal = Sociology of Religion in India | isbn = 978-0-7619-9781-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&pg=PA125 | accessdate = 2008-05-03}}</ref><ref name=Kinsley1972>{{cite journal | author = Kinsley, D. | year = 2010 | title = Without Krsna There Is No Song | journal = History of Religions | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | page = 149 | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=G&oi=qs&q=nimbarka+radha+first+author:d-sarma | accessdate = 2008-05-03 | doi = 10.1086/462672}} \"Nimbarka seems to have been the first well-known religious leader to regard Radha as central to his worship (thirteenth century)\"</ref>\n\n==Temples==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Prem Mandir - Vrindaban 2013-02-22 4834.JPG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Radha Krishna Statue at Gokarneshwor Mahadev Temple Premises, Gokarna, Kathmandu.jpg\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:Radha-Krishna ''Prem Mandir'' (Love Temple) in Vrindavan, [[Uttar Pradesh]]; Right: Krishna-Radha in Gokarneshwar temple, [[Nepal]].\n}}\nRadha and Krishna are the focus of temples in the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabhacharya, Chandidas and other traditions of Vaishnavism.<ref name=dalal321/> She is typically shown standing immediately next to Krishna.<ref name=dalal321/> Some important Radha temples are:\n*[[Barsana]] and [[Vrindavan]] in [[Mathura District]], Northern India contain a large number of temples dedicated to both Radha and Krishna, including the Radhavallabh Temple.<ref>[http://www.radhavallabh.com Radhavallabh Temple]</ref> Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi Mandir in [[Delhi]] is also the Radha krishna Temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.radha.name/images-gallery/temples-worldwide-without-india/asia-without-India|title=Asia and India ISKCON temples|work=Radha}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |url          = http://m.dandavats.com/?p=6770\n |work         = Dandavats\n |title        = Archived copy\n |access-date  = 29 July 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112447/http://m.dandavats.com/?p=6770\n |archive-date = 26 June 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n* The [[Radha Madhav Dham#Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple|Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple]] at [[Radha Madhav Dham]] in [[Austin, Texas]], USA, established by [[Jagadguru Kripalu Maharaj|Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj]], is one of the largest Hindu Temple complexes in the [[Western Hemisphere]],<ref name=\"hua\">''[http://hua.edu/media/mediasupportfiles/newsletters_brochures/HU-Newsletter-7-03.pdf Vedic Foundation Inaugurated at Barsana Dham, Austin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818030758/http://hua.edu/media/mediasupportfiles/newsletters_brochures/HU-Newsletter-7-03.pdf |date=18 August 2011 }}''.

The poem's title is a reference to the [[Battle of Pharsalus]], which occurred in 48 BC, near [[Pharsalus]], [[Thessaly]], in northern [[Greece]]. Caesar decisively defeated Pompey in this battle, which occupies all of the epic's seventh book. In the early twentieth century, translator [[James Duff Duff|J. D. Duff]], while arguing that \"no reasonable judgment can rank Lucan among the world's great epic poets\", notes that the work is notable for Lucan's decision to eschew divine intervention and downplay supernatural occurrences in the events of the story.<ref name=duffxii/> Scholarly estimation of Lucan's poem and poetry has since changed, as explained by commentator [[Philip Hardie]] in 2013: \"In recent decades, it has undergone a thorough critical re-evaluation, to re-emerge as a major expression of Neronian politics and aesthetics, a poem whose studied artifice enacts a complex relationship between poetic fantasy and historical reality.\"<ref name=\"Hardie\">Hardie (2013), p. 225</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe poem was begun around 61 AD and several books were in circulation before the Emperor [[Nero]] and Lucan had a bitter falling out.  Lucan continued to work on the epic \u2013 despite Nero's prohibition against any publication of Lucan's poetry \u2013 and it was left unfinished when Lucan was compelled to suicide as part of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] in 65 AD. A total of ten books were written and all survive; the tenth book breaks off abruptly with Caesar in Egypt.\n\n== Contents ==\n\n{{multiple image|image1=Caesar.jpg|width1=218|alt1=A marble bust of Julius Caesar, looking left|image2=Pompey the Great.jpg|width2=190|alt2=A marble bust of Pompey the Great, looking left|footer=The ''Pharsalia'' details the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] between [[Julius Caesar]] (''left'') and [[Pompey the Great]] (''right'').}}\n\n'''Book I''': After a brief introduction lamenting the idea of Romans fighting Romans and an ostensibly flattering dedication to Nero, the narrative summarizes background material leading up to the present war and introduces Caesar in northern Italy.  Despite an urgent plea from the Spirit of Rome to lay down his arms, Caesar crosses the Rubicon, rallies his troops and marches south to Rome, joined by [[Gaius_Scribonius_Curio_(praetor_49_BC)|Curio]] along the way.  The book closes with panic in the city, terrible portents and visions of the disaster to come.\n\n'''Book 2''':  In a city overcome by despair, an old veteran presents a lengthy interlude regarding the previous civil war that pitted [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] against [[Sulla]]. [[Cato the Younger]] is introduced as a heroic man of principle; as abhorrent as civil war is, he argues to [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] that it is better to fight than do nothing.  After siding with Pompey\u2014the lesser of two evils\u2014he remarries his ex-wife, [[Marcia (wife of Cato the Younger)|Marcia]], and heads to the field.  Caesar continues south through Italy and is delayed by Domitius' brave resistance.  He attempts a blockade of Pompey at [[Brundisium]], but the general makes a narrow escape to Greece.\n\n'''Book 3''': As his ships sail, Pompey is visited in a dream by Julia, his dead wife and Caesar's daughter.  Caesar returns to Rome and plunders the city, while Pompey reviews potential foreign allies.  Caesar then heads for Spain, but his troops are detained at the lengthy siege of Massilia (Marseille). The city ultimately falls in a bloody naval battle.\n\n'''Book 4''': The first half of this book is occupied with Caesar's victorious campaign in Spain against Afranius and Petreius.  Switching scenes to Pompey, his forces intercept a raft carrying Caesarians, who prefer to kill each other rather than be taken prisoner.  The book concludes with Curio launching an African campaign on Caesar's behalf, where he is defeated and slain by the African King Juba.\n\n'''Book 5''': The Senate in exile confirms Pompey the true leader of Rome.  Appius consults the [[Delphic oracle]] to learn of his fate in the war, and leaves with a misleading prophecy. In Italy, after defusing a mutiny, Caesar marches to Brundisium and sails across the Adriatic to meet Pompey's army.  Only a portion of Caesar's troops complete the crossing when a storm prevents further transit; he tries to personally send a message back but is himself nearly drowned.  Finally, the storm subsides, and the armies face each other at full strength.  With battle at hand, Pompey sends his wife to the island of [[Lesbos]].\n\n'''Book 6''': Pompey's troops force Caesar's armies \u2013 featuring the heroic centurion Scaeva \u2013 to fall back to [[Thessaly]].  Lucan describes the wild Thessalian terrain as the armies wait for battle the next day.  The remainder of the book follows Pompey's son Sextus, who wishes to know the future.  He finds the most powerful witch in Thessaly, [[Erichtho]], and she reanimates the corpse of a dead soldier in a terrifying ceremony.  The soldier predicts Pompey's defeat and Caesar's eventual assassination.\n\n'''Book 7''': The soldiers are pressing for battle, but Pompey is reluctant until Cicero convinces him to attack.  The Caesarians are victorious, and Lucan laments the loss of liberty.  Caesar is especially cruel as he mocks the dying Domitius and forbids cremation of the dead Pompeians.  The scene is punctuated by a description of wild animals gnawing at the corpses, and a lament from Lucan for ''Thessalia, infelix'' \u2013 ill-fated Thessaly.\n\n'''Book 8''': Pompey himself escapes to Lesbos, reunites with his wife, then goes to [[Cilicia]] to consider his options.  He decides to enlist aid from Egypt, but [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|the Pharaoh]] is fearful of retribution from Caesar and plots to murder Pompey when he lands.  Pompey suspects treachery; he consoles his wife and rows alone to the shore, meeting his fate with Stoic poise.  His headless body is flung into the ocean, but washes up on shore and receives a humble burial from Cordus.\n\n'''Book 9''': Pompey's wife mourns her husband as Cato takes up leadership of the Senate's cause.  He plans to regroup and heroically marches the army across Africa to join forces with King Juba, a trek that occupies most of the middle section of the book.  On the way, he passes an oracle but refuses to consult it, citing Stoic principles.  Caesar visits Troy and pays respects to his ancestral gods.  A short time later he arrives in Egypt; when Pharaoh's messenger presents him with the head of Pompey, Caesar feigns grief to hide his joy at Pompey's death.\n\n'''Book 10''': Caesar arrives in Egypt, where he is beguiled by the Pharaoh's sister [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]].  A banquet is held; Pothinus, Ptolemy's cynical and bloodthirsty chief minister, plots an assassination of Caesar but is killed in his surprise attack on the palace.  A second attack comes from Ganymede, an Egyptian noble, and the poem breaks off abruptly as Caesar is fighting for his life.\n\n=== Completeness ===\n\n[[File:Charles Le Brun - Suic\u00eddio de Cat\u00e3o de \u00datica.jpg|thumb|Susanna Braund argues that, were the poem to have been finished, it would have ended with [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s death.]]\n\nAlmost all scholars agree that the ''Pharsalia'' as we now have it is unfinished. (There is, however, some debate as to whether the poem was unfinished at the time of Lucan's death, or if the final few books of the work were lost at some point. Braund notes that there is little evidence one way or the other, and that this question must \"remain a matter of speculation.\")<ref name=braundxxxvii>Braund (1992), p. xxxvii.</ref> Some argue that Lucan intended to end his poem with the [[Battle of Philippi]] (42 BC) or the [[Battle of Actium]] (31 BC). However, both of these hypotheses seem unlikely, as they would have required Lucan to pen a work many times larger than what is extant (for instance, the ten-book poem we have today covers a total of 20 months time, so it seems unlikely that, were the poet to have continued his pace, that his work would cover a 6 to 17 year time-span).<ref name=braundxxxvii/> Another, \"more attractive\" argument (according to Susanna Braund), is that Lucan intended for his poem to be sixteen books long and to end with the assassination of Caesar. However, this too has its problems, namely that Lucan would have been required to introduce and rapidly develop characters to replace Pompey and Cato. It also might have given the work a \"happy ending\", which seems tonally inconsistent with the poem as a whole.<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxxvii{{en dash}}xxxviii</ref> Ultimately, Braund argues that the best hypothesis is that Lucan's original intent was a 12 book poem, mirroring the length of the ''Aeneid''. The biggest internal argument for this is that in his sixth book Lucan features a necromantic ritual that parallels and inverts many of the motifs found in Virgil's sixth book (which details ''Aeneas'' consultation with the [[Sibyl of Cumae|Sibyl]] and his subsequent descent into the underworld). And if the book were to be 12 books long, Braund contends that it would have ended with the death of Cato, and his subsequent [[apotheosis]] as a Stoic hero.<ref name=braundxxxviii>Braund (1992), p. xxxviii.</ref><ref>Braund (2009), p. xxii.</ref>\n\nConversely, the Latinist Jamie Masters argues the opposite: that the finale of book ten is indeed the ending to the work as Lucan intended. Masters devotes an entire chapter to this hypothesis in his book ''Poetry and Civil War in Lucan's'' Bellum Civile (1992), arguing that by being open-ended and ambiguous, the poem's conclusion avoids \"any kind of resolution, but [still] preserves the unconventional premises of its subject-matter: evil without alternative, contradiction without compromise, civil war without end.\"<ref>Masters (1992), p. 259.</ref>\n\n=== Title ===\n\nThe poem is popularly known as the ''Pharsalia'', largely due to lines 985{{en dash}}6 in book 9, which read, ''Pharsalia nostra'' / ''Vivet'' (\"Our Pharsalia shall live on\").<ref name=duffxii>Duff (1928), p. xii.</ref><ref>Lucan & Duff (1928), pp. 578{{en dash}}8.</ref> However, many scholars, such as [[James Duff Duff]] and Braund, note that this is a recent name given to the work, and that the earliest manuscripts of the poem refer to it as ''De Bello Civili'' (''Concerning the Civil War'').<ref name=duffxii/><ref name=braundxxxviii/> Braund further argues that calling the poem ''Pharsalia'' \"excessively ... privilege[s] ... an episode which occupies only one book and occurs in the centre of the poem, rather than at its climax.\"<ref name=braundxxxviii/>\n\n=== Style ===\n\nLucan is heavily influenced by Latin poetic tradition, most notably [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and of course [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the work to which the ''Pharsalia'' is most naturally compared.  Lucan frequently appropriates ideas from Virgil's epic and \"inverts\" them to undermine their original, heroic purpose.  Sextus' visit to the Thracian witch [[Erichtho]] provides an example; the scene and language clearly reference Aeneas' descent into the underworld (also in Book VI), but while Virgil's description highlights optimism toward the future glories of Rome under Augustan rule, Lucan uses the scene to present a bitter and gory pessimism concerning the loss of liberty under the coming empire.\n\nLike all [[Silver Age]] poets, Lucan received the rhetorical training common to upper-class young men of the period.  The ''suasoria'' \u2013 a school exercise where students wrote speeches advising an historical figure on a course of action \u2013 no doubt inspired Lucan to compose some of the speeches found in the text.<ref>[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'', 3.5.8-15, which specifically mentions the question \"whether Cato should marry\" as a school speech topic, one addressed by Lucan in a scene from book 2.</ref> Lucan also follows the Silver Age custom of punctuating his verse with short, pithy lines or slogans known as ''sententiae'', a rhetorical tactic used to grab the attention of a crowd interested in oratory as a form of public entertainment. [[Quintilian]] singles out Lucan as a writer ''clarissimus sententiis'' \u2013 \"most famous for his ''sententiae''\", and for this reason ''magis oratoribus quam poetis imitandus'' \u2013 \"(he is) to be imitated more by orators than poets\".<ref>[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'', 10.1.90.</ref> His style makes him unusually difficult to read.\n\nFinally, in another break with [[Golden Age]] literary techniques, Lucan is fond of discontinuity.  He presents his narrative as a series of discrete episodes often without any transitional or scene-changing lines, much like the sketches of myth strung together in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.  The poem is more naturally organized on principles such as aesthetic balance or correspondence of scenes between books rather than the need to follow a story from a single narrative point of view. Lucan was considered among the ranks of Homer and Virgil.\n\n==Themes==\n\n=== Horrors of civil war ===\n\nLucan emphasizes the despair of his topic in the poem's first seven lines (the same length as the opening to Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]''):{{#tag:ref|A controversy has erupted about whether the first seven lines of the poem were written by Lucan, or if they were added after his death by someone close to him. [[Suetonius]] contended that either [[Seneca the Younger]] or Lucan's brother was the one who added the lines, so that the poem did not begin abruptly with the exclamation ''Quis furor'' (\"What horror\").<ref>Conte (2010), p. 46.</ref><ref>Conte (2010), p. 46, note 2.</ref> Others have suggested that the lines were written to replace the encomium to Nero after the poet had cooled to the emperor.<ref name=conte49>Conte (2010), p. 49.</ref><ref>Conte (2010), p. 49, note 7.</ref> Gian Biagio Conte, however, repudiates these ideas, echoing the arguments of the classicist E. Malcovati that the proem was intended to recall the openings to both the ''Aeneid'' and the ''Iliad''. Conte further argues that Lucan's first seven lines and the line beginning ''Quis furor'' (i.e. line 8) form one \"compositional thrust\".<ref>Conte (2010), pp. 47{{en dash}}9.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|Bella per Emathios plus quam civilia campos\niusque datum sceleri canimus, populumque potentem\nin sua victrici conversum viscera dextra\ncognatasque acies, et rupto foedere regni\ncertatum totis concussi viribus orbis\nin commune nefas, infestisque obvia signis\nsigna, pares aquilas et pila minantia pilis.}}\n|attr2=from the 1896 Sir Edward Ridley translation|\nWars worse than civil on Emathian plains,\nand crime let loose we sing; how Rome's high race \nplunged in her vitals her victorious sword;\narmies akin embattled, with the force\nof all the shaken earth bent on the fray;\nand burst asunder, to the common guilt,\na kingdom's compact; eagle with eagle met,\nstandard to standard, spear opposed to spear.}}\n\nEvents throughout the poem are described in terms of insanity and sacrilege. Far from glorious, the battle scenes are portraits of bloody horror, where nature is ravaged to build terrible siege engines and wild animals tear mercilessly at the flesh of the dead (perhaps reflecting the taste of an audience accustomed to the bloodlust of gladiatorial games).\n\n=== Flawed characters ===\n\nMost of the main characters featured in the ''Pharsalia'' are terribly flawed and unattractive. Caesar, for instance, is presented as a successful military leader, but he strikes fear into the hearts of people and is extremely destructive.<ref name=braundxxi/> Lucan conveys this by using a simile (book 1, lines 151{{en dash}}7) that compares Caesar to a [[thunderbolt]]:\n\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|qualiter expressum uentis per nubila fulmen\naetheris inpulsi sonitu mundique fragore\nemicuit rupitque diem populosque pauentes\nterruit obliqua praestringens lumina flamma:\nin sua templa furit, nullaque exire uetante\nmateria magnamque cadens magnamque reuertens\ndat stragem late sparsosque recolligit ignes.}}\n|attr2=From Susanna Braund's 1992 translation<ref name=braundxxi>Braund (1992), p. xxi.</ref>|\nJust so flashes out the thunderbolt shot forth by the winds through clouds,\naccompanied by the crashing of the heavens and sound of shattered ether;\nit splits the sky and terrifies the panicked\npeople, searing eyes with slanting flame;\nagainst its own precincts it rages, and, with nothing solid stopping\nits course, both as it falls and then returns great is the devastation\ndealt far and wide before it gathers again its scattered fires.}}\n\nThroughout the ''Pharsalia'', this simile holds, and Caesar is continuously depicted as an active force, who strikes with great power.<ref>Rosner-Siegel, Judith (2010), p. 187.</ref>\n\nPompey, on the other hand, is old and past his prime, and years of peacetime have turned him soft.<ref name=braundxxi/> Susanna Braund argues that Lucan \"has taken the weaker, essentially ''human'', elements of Aeneas' character{{em dash}}Aeneas doubting his mission, Aeneas as husband and lover{{em dash}}and bestowed them upon Pompey.\"<ref name=braundxxii/> And while this portrays the leader as indecisive, slow to action, and ultimately ineffective, it does make him the only main character shown to have any sort of \"emotional life.\"<ref name=braundxxii>Braund (1992), p. xxii.</ref> What is more, Lucan at times explicitly roots for Pompey.<ref name=braundxxii/> But nevertheless, the leader is doomed in the end. Lucan compares Pompey to a large oak-tree (book 1, lines 136{{en dash}}43), which is still quite magnificent due to its size but on the verge of tipping over:\n\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|qualis frugifero quercus sublimis in agro\nexuuias ueteris populi sacrataque gestans\ndona ducum nec iam ualidis radicibus haerens\npondere fixa suo est, nudosque per aera ramos\neffundens trunco, non frondibus, efficit umbram,\net quamuis primo nutet casura sub Euro,\ntot circum siluae firmo se robore tollant,\nsola tamen colitur.}}\n|attr2=From Susanna Braund's 1992 translation<ref name=braundxxi>Braund (1992), p. xxi.</ref>|\nLike in a fruitful field, a lofty oak,\nbearing the people's spoils of old and generals'\nhallowed dedications; clinging with roots no longer strong,\nby its own weight it stands firm, and spreading naked branches\nthrough the air, it makes shade with trunk, not foliage;\nand though it totters, ready to fall beneath the first Eurus,\nthough all around so many trees upraise themselves with sturdy trunks,\nyet it alone is venerated.}}\n\nBy comparing Caesar to a bolt of lightning, and Pompey to a large tree on the verge of death, Lucan poetically implies early on in the ''Pharsalia'' that Caesar will strike and fell Pompey.<ref name=braundxxi/>\n\nThe grand exception to this generally bleak depiction of characters is Cato, who stands as a Stoic ideal in the face of a world gone mad (he alone, for example, refuses to consult oracles to know the future).  Pompey also seems transformed after Pharsalus, becoming a kind of stoic [[martyr]]; calm in the face of certain death upon arrival in Egypt, he receives virtual canonization from Lucan at the start of book IX.  This elevation of Stoic and Republican principles is in sharp contrast to the ambitious and imperial Caesar, who becomes an even greater monster after the decisive battle.  Even though Caesar wins in the end, Lucan makes his sentiments known in the famous line ''Victrix causa deis placuit sed Victa Catoni'' \u2013 \"The victorious cause pleased the gods, but the vanquished [cause] pleased Cato.\"\n\n=== Anti-imperialism ===\n\nGiven Lucan's clear anti-imperialism, the flattering Book I dedication to Nero \u2013 which includes lines like ''multum Roma tamen debet ciuilibus armis | quod tibi res acta est'' \u2013 \"But Rome is greater by these civil wars, because it resulted in you\"<ref>[[Lucan]], ''Pharsalia'', 1.44{{en dash}}5.</ref> \u2013 is somewhat puzzling.  Some scholars have tried to read these lines ironically, but most see it as a traditional dedication written at a time before the (supposed) true depravity of Lucan's patron was revealed.  The extant \"Lives\" of the poet support this interpretation, stating that a portion of the ''Pharsalia'' was in circulation before Lucan and Nero had their falling out.\n\nFurthermore, according to Braund, Lucan's negative portrayal of Caesar in the early portion of the poem was not likely meant as criticism of Nero, and it may have been Lucan's way of warning the new emperor about the issues of the past.<ref>Braund (1992), p. xv.</ref>\n\n=== Treatment of the supernatural ===\n\n[[File:Erichtho.jpg|thumb|In book six, [[Erichtho]] (''pictured'') performs a necromantic rite, which many contend is one of the ''Pharsalia''{{'s}} best-known sequences.]]\n\nLucan breaks from epic tradition by minimizing, and in certain cases, completely ignoring (and some argue, denying) the existence of the traditional Roman deities.<ref name=braund2009xxiii/><ref>Leigh (1997) p. 98, note 43.</ref> This is in marked contrast to his predecessors, Vergil and Ovid, who used anthropomorphized gods and goddesses as major players in their works. According to Susanna Braund, by choosing to not focus on the gods, Lucan emphasizes and underscores the human role in the atrocities of the Roman civil war.<ref name=braund2009xxiii>Braund (2009), pp. xxiii{{en dash}}xxiv.</ref> James Duff Duff, on the other hand, argues that \"[Lucan] was dealing with Roman history and with fairly recent events; and the introduction of the gods as actors must have been grotesque.\"<ref>Duff (1928), p. xiii.</ref>\n\nThis, however, is not to say that the ''Pharsalia'' is devoid of any supernatural phenomenon; in fact, quite the opposite is true, and Braund argues that \"the supernatural in all its manifestations played a highly significant part in the structuring of the epic.\"<ref>Braund (1992), p. xxix.</ref> Braund sees the supernatural as falling into two categories: \"dreams and visions\" and \"portents, prophecies, and consultations of supernatural powers\".<ref name=braund1992xxv>Braund (1992), p. xxv.</ref> In regards to the first category, the poem features four explicit and important dream and vision sequences: Caesar's vision of Roma as he is about to cross the Rubicon, the ghost of Julia appearing to Pompey, Pompey's dream of his happy past, and Caesar and his troops' dream of battle and destruction.<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxv{{en dash}}xxvii.</ref> All four of these dream-visions are placed strategically throughout the poem, \"to provide balance and contrast.\"<ref name=braund1992xxv/> In regards to the second category, Lucan describes a number portents,<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxvi{{en dash}}xxvii.</ref> two oracular episodes,<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxvii{{en dash}}xxviii.</ref> and perhaps most famously Erichtho's necromantic rite.<ref name=\"Braund 1992, p. xxviii\">Braund (1992), p. xxviii.</ref> This manifestation of the supernatural is more public, and serves many purposes, including to reflect \"Rome's turmoil on the supernatural plane\", as well as simply to \"contribute to the atmosphere of sinster foreboding\" by describing disturbing rituals.<ref>Braund (1992), p. xxvii.</ref><ref name=\"Braund 1992, p. xxviii\"/>\n\n=== The poem as civil war ===\n\nAccording to Jamie Masters, Lucan's ''Pharsalia'' is not just a poem about a civil war, but rather in a metaphorical way ''is'' a civil war. In other words, he argues that Lucan embraces the metaphor of internal discord and allows it to determine the way the story is told by weaving it into the fabric of the poem itself.<ref name=masters10/><ref>Masters (1992), p. i.</ref> Masters proposes that Lucan's work is both \"Pompeian\" (in the sense that it celebrates the memory of Pompey, revels in delay, and decries the horrors of civil war) and \"Caesarian\" (in the sense that it still recounts Pompey's death, eventually overcomes delay, and describes the horrors of war in careful detail).<ref name=masters8-10>Masters (1992), pp. 8{{en dash}}10.</ref> Because Lucan is on both of the characters' sides whilst also supporting neither, the poem is inherently at war with itself.<ref name=masters10>Masters (1992), p. 10.</ref> Furthermore, because Lucan seems to place numerous obstacles before Caesar, he can be seen as opposing Caesar's actions. However, since Lucan still chooses to record them in song, he{{em dash}}being the poet and thus the one who has the final say on what goes into his work{{em dash}}is in some ways waging the war himself.<ref>Masters (1992), pp. 5{{en dash}}7.</ref> Ultimately, Masters refers to the binary opposition that he sees throughout the entire poem as Lucan's \"schizophrenic poetic persona\".<ref>Masters (1992), p. 9.</ref><ref>Davis (1993).</ref>\n\n=== Poetic representation of history ===\n\nThough the ''Pharsalia'' is an historical epic, it would be wrong to think Lucan is only interested in the details of history itself.

The poem's title is a reference to the [[Battle of Pharsalus]], which occurred in 48 BC, near [[Pharsalus]], [[Thessaly]], in northern [[Greece]]. Caesar decisively defeated Pompey in this battle, which occupies all of the epic's seventh book. In the early twentieth century, translator [[James Duff Duff|J. D. Duff]], while arguing that \"no reasonable judgment can rank Lucan among the world's great epic poets\", notes that the work is notable for Lucan's decision to eschew divine intervention and downplay supernatural occurrences in the events of the story.<ref name=duffxii/> Scholarly estimation of Lucan's poem and poetry has since changed, as explained by commentator [[Philip Hardie]] in 2013: \"In recent decades, it has undergone a thorough critical re-evaluation, to re-emerge as a major expression of Neronian politics and aesthetics, a poem whose studied artifice enacts a complex relationship between poetic fantasy and historical reality.\"<ref name=\"Hardie\">Hardie (2013), p. 225</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe poem was begun around 61 AD and several books were in circulation before the Emperor [[Nero]] and Lucan had a bitter falling out.  Lucan continued to work on the epic \u2013 despite Nero's prohibition against any publication of Lucan's poetry \u2013 and it was left unfinished when Lucan was compelled to suicide as part of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] in 65 AD. A total of ten books were written and all survive; the tenth book breaks off abruptly with Caesar in Egypt.\n\n== Contents ==\n\n{{multiple image|image1=Caesar.jpg|width1=218|alt1=A marble bust of Julius Caesar, looking left|image2=Pompey the Great.jpg|width2=190|alt2=A marble bust of Pompey the Great, looking left|footer=The ''Pharsalia'' details the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] between [[Julius Caesar]] (''left'') and [[Pompey the Great]] (''right'').}}\n\n'''Book I''': After a brief introduction lamenting the idea of Romans fighting Romans and an ostensibly flattering dedication to Nero, the narrative summarizes background material leading up to the present war and introduces Caesar in northern Italy.  Despite an urgent plea from the Spirit of Rome to lay down his arms, Caesar crosses the Rubicon, rallies his troops and marches south to Rome, joined by [[Gaius_Scribonius_Curio_(praetor_49_BC)|Curio]] along the way.  The book closes with panic in the city, terrible portents and visions of the disaster to come.\n\n'''Book 2''':  In a city overcome by despair, an old veteran presents a lengthy interlude regarding the previous civil war that pitted [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] against [[Sulla]]. [[Cato the Younger]] is introduced as a heroic man of principle; as abhorrent as civil war is, he argues to [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] that it is better to fight than do nothing.  After siding with Pompey\u2014the lesser of two evils\u2014he remarries his ex-wife, [[Marcia (wife of Cato the Younger)|Marcia]], and heads to the field.  Caesar continues south through Italy and is delayed by Domitius' brave resistance.  He attempts a blockade of Pompey at [[Brundisium]], but the general makes a narrow escape to Greece.\n\n'''Book 3''': As his ships sail, Pompey is visited in a dream by Julia, his dead wife and Caesar's daughter.  Caesar returns to Rome and plunders the city, while Pompey reviews potential foreign allies.  Caesar then heads for Spain, but his troops are detained at the lengthy siege of Massilia (Marseille). The city ultimately falls in a bloody naval battle.\n\n'''Book 4''': The first half of this book is occupied with Caesar's victorious campaign in Spain against Afranius and Petreius.  Switching scenes to Pompey, his forces intercept a raft carrying Caesarians, who prefer to kill each other rather than be taken prisoner.  The book concludes with Curio launching an African campaign on Caesar's behalf, where he is defeated and slain by the African King Juba.\n\n'''Book 5''': The Senate in exile confirms Pompey the true leader of Rome.  Appius consults the [[Delphic oracle]] to learn of his fate in the war, and leaves with a misleading prophecy. In Italy, after defusing a mutiny, Caesar marches to Brundisium and sails across the Adriatic to meet Pompey's army.  Only a portion of Caesar's troops complete the crossing when a storm prevents further transit; he tries to personally send a message back but is himself nearly drowned.  Finally, the storm subsides, and the armies face each other at full strength.  With battle at hand, Pompey sends his wife to the island of [[Lesbos]].\n\n'''Book 6''': Pompey's troops force Caesar's armies \u2013 featuring the heroic centurion Scaeva \u2013 to fall back to [[Thessaly]].  Lucan describes the wild Thessalian terrain as the armies wait for battle the next day.  The remainder of the book follows Pompey's son Sextus, who wishes to know the future.  He finds the most powerful witch in Thessaly, [[Erichtho]], and she reanimates the corpse of a dead soldier in a terrifying ceremony.  The soldier predicts Pompey's defeat and Caesar's eventual assassination.\n\n'''Book 7''': The soldiers are pressing for battle, but Pompey is reluctant until Cicero convinces him to attack.  The Caesarians are victorious, and Lucan laments the loss of liberty.  Caesar is especially cruel as he mocks the dying Domitius and forbids cremation of the dead Pompeians.  The scene is punctuated by a description of wild animals gnawing at the corpses, and a lament from Lucan for ''Thessalia, infelix'' \u2013 ill-fated Thessaly.\n\n'''Book 8''': Pompey himself escapes to Lesbos, reunites with his wife, then goes to [[Cilicia]] to consider his options.  He decides to enlist aid from Egypt, but [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|the Pharaoh]] is fearful of retribution from Caesar and plots to murder Pompey when he lands.  Pompey suspects treachery; he consoles his wife and rows alone to the shore, meeting his fate with Stoic poise.  His headless body is flung into the ocean, but washes up on shore and receives a humble burial from Cordus.\n\n'''Book 9''': Pompey's wife mourns her husband as Cato takes up leadership of the Senate's cause.  He plans to regroup and heroically marches the army across Africa to join forces with King Juba, a trek that occupies most of the middle section of the book.  On the way, he passes an oracle but refuses to consult it, citing Stoic principles.  Caesar visits Troy and pays respects to his ancestral gods.  A short time later he arrives in Egypt; when Pharaoh's messenger presents him with the head of Pompey, Caesar feigns grief to hide his joy at Pompey's death.\n\n'''Book 10''': Caesar arrives in Egypt, where he is beguiled by the Pharaoh's sister [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]].  A banquet is held; Pothinus, Ptolemy's cynical and bloodthirsty chief minister, plots an assassination of Caesar but is killed in his surprise attack on the palace.  A second attack comes from Ganymede, an Egyptian noble, and the poem breaks off abruptly as Caesar is fighting for his life.\n\n=== Completeness ===\n\n[[File:Charles Le Brun - Suic\u00eddio de Cat\u00e3o de \u00datica.jpg|thumb|Susanna Braund argues that, were the poem to have been finished, it would have ended with [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s death.]]\n\nAlmost all scholars agree that the ''Pharsalia'' as we now have it is unfinished. (There is, however, some debate as to whether the poem was unfinished at the time of Lucan's death, or if the final few books of the work were lost at some point. Braund notes that there is little evidence one way or the other, and that this question must \"remain a matter of speculation.\")<ref name=braundxxxvii>Braund (1992), p. xxxvii.</ref> Some argue that Lucan intended to end his poem with the [[Battle of Philippi]] (42 BC) or the [[Battle of Actium]] (31 BC). However, both of these hypotheses seem unlikely, as they would have required Lucan to pen a work many times larger than what is extant (for instance, the ten-book poem we have today covers a total of 20 months time, so it seems unlikely that, were the poet to have continued his pace, that his work would cover a 6 to 17 year time-span).<ref name=braundxxxvii/> Another, \"more attractive\" argument (according to Susanna Braund), is that Lucan intended for his poem to be sixteen books long and to end with the assassination of Caesar. However, this too has its problems, namely that Lucan would have been required to introduce and rapidly develop characters to replace Pompey and Cato. It also might have given the work a \"happy ending\", which seems tonally inconsistent with the poem as a whole.<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxxvii{{en dash}}xxxviii</ref> Ultimately, Braund argues that the best hypothesis is that Lucan's original intent was a 12 book poem, mirroring the length of the ''Aeneid''. The biggest internal argument for this is that in his sixth book Lucan features a necromantic ritual that parallels and inverts many of the motifs found in Virgil's sixth book (which details ''Aeneas'' consultation with the [[Sibyl of Cumae|Sibyl]] and his subsequent descent into the underworld). And if the book were to be 12 books long, Braund contends that it would have ended with the death of Cato, and his subsequent [[apotheosis]] as a Stoic hero.<ref name=braundxxxviii>Braund (1992), p. xxxviii.</ref><ref>Braund (2009), p. xxii.</ref>\n\nConversely, the Latinist Jamie Masters argues the opposite: that the finale of book ten is indeed the ending to the work as Lucan intended. Masters devotes an entire chapter to this hypothesis in his book ''Poetry and Civil War in Lucan's'' Bellum Civile (1992), arguing that by being open-ended and ambiguous, the poem's conclusion avoids \"any kind of resolution, but [still] preserves the unconventional premises of its subject-matter: evil without alternative, contradiction without compromise, civil war without end.\"<ref>Masters (1992), p. 259.</ref>\n\n=== Title ===\n\nThe poem is popularly known as the ''Pharsalia'', largely due to lines 985{{en dash}}6 in book 9, which read, ''Pharsalia nostra'' / ''Vivet'' (\"Our Pharsalia shall live on\").<ref name=duffxii>Duff (1928), p. xii.</ref><ref>Lucan & Duff (1928), pp. 578{{en dash}}8.</ref> However, many scholars, such as [[James Duff Duff]] and Braund, note that this is a recent name given to the work, and that the earliest manuscripts of the poem refer to it as ''De Bello Civili'' (''Concerning the Civil War'').<ref name=duffxii/><ref name=braundxxxviii/> Braund further argues that calling the poem ''Pharsalia'' \"excessively ... privilege[s] ... an episode which occupies only one book and occurs in the centre of the poem, rather than at its climax.\"<ref name=braundxxxviii/>\n\n=== Style ===\n\nLucan is heavily influenced by Latin poetic tradition, most notably [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and of course [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the work to which the ''Pharsalia'' is most naturally compared.  Lucan frequently appropriates ideas from Virgil's epic and \"inverts\" them to undermine their original, heroic purpose.  Sextus' visit to the Thracian witch [[Erichtho]] provides an example; the scene and language clearly reference Aeneas' descent into the underworld (also in Book VI), but while Virgil's description highlights optimism toward the future glories of Rome under Augustan rule, Lucan uses the scene to present a bitter and gory pessimism concerning the loss of liberty under the coming empire.\n\nLike all [[Silver Age]] poets, Lucan received the rhetorical training common to upper-class young men of the period.  The ''suasoria'' \u2013 a school exercise where students wrote speeches advising an historical figure on a course of action \u2013 no doubt inspired Lucan to compose some of the speeches found in the text.<ref>[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'', 3.5.8-15, which specifically mentions the question \"whether Cato should marry\" as a school speech topic, one addressed by Lucan in a scene from book 2.</ref> Lucan also follows the Silver Age custom of punctuating his verse with short, pithy lines or slogans known as ''sententiae'', a rhetorical tactic used to grab the attention of a crowd interested in oratory as a form of public entertainment. [[Quintilian]] singles out Lucan as a writer ''clarissimus sententiis'' \u2013 \"most famous for his ''sententiae''\", and for this reason ''magis oratoribus quam poetis imitandus'' \u2013 \"(he is) to be imitated more by orators than poets\".<ref>[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'', 10.1.90.</ref> His style makes him unusually difficult to read.\n\nFinally, in another break with [[Golden Age]] literary techniques, Lucan is fond of discontinuity.  He presents his narrative as a series of discrete episodes often without any transitional or scene-changing lines, much like the sketches of myth strung together in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.  The poem is more naturally organized on principles such as aesthetic balance or correspondence of scenes between books rather than the need to follow a story from a single narrative point of view. Lucan was considered among the ranks of Homer and Virgil.\n\n==Themes==\n\n=== Horrors of civil war ===\n\nLucan emphasizes the despair of his topic in the poem's first seven lines (the same length as the opening to Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]''):{{#tag:ref|A controversy has erupted about whether the first seven lines of the poem were written by Lucan, or if they were added after his death by someone close to him. [[Suetonius]] contended that either [[Seneca the Younger]] or Lucan's brother was the one who added the lines, so that the poem did not begin abruptly with the exclamation ''Quis furor'' (\"What horror\").<ref>Conte (2010), p. 46.</ref><ref>Conte (2010), p. 46, note 2.</ref> Others have suggested that the lines were written to replace the encomium to Nero after the poet had cooled to the emperor.<ref name=conte49>Conte (2010), p. 49.</ref><ref>Conte (2010), p. 49, note 7.</ref> Gian Biagio Conte, however, repudiates these ideas, echoing the arguments of the classicist E. Malcovati that the proem was intended to recall the openings to both the ''Aeneid'' and the ''Iliad''. Conte further argues that Lucan's first seven lines and the line beginning ''Quis furor'' (i.e. line 8) form one \"compositional thrust\".<ref>Conte (2010), pp. 47{{en dash}}9.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|Bella per Emathios plus quam civilia campos\niusque datum sceleri canimus, populumque potentem\nin sua victrici conversum viscera dextra\ncognatasque acies, et rupto foedere regni\ncertatum totis concussi viribus orbis\nin commune nefas, infestisque obvia signis\nsigna, pares aquilas et pila minantia pilis.}}\n|attr2=from the 1896 Sir Edward Ridley translation|\nWars worse than civil on Emathian plains,\nand crime let loose we sing; how Rome's high race \nplunged in her vitals her victorious sword;\narmies akin embattled, with the force\nof all the shaken earth bent on the fray;\nand burst asunder, to the common guilt,\na kingdom's compact; eagle with eagle met,\nstandard to standard, spear opposed to spear.}}\n\nEvents throughout the poem are described in terms of insanity and sacrilege. Far from glorious, the battle scenes are portraits of bloody horror, where nature is ravaged to build terrible siege engines and wild animals tear mercilessly at the flesh of the dead (perhaps reflecting the taste of an audience accustomed to the bloodlust of gladiatorial games).\n\n=== Flawed characters ===\n\nMost of the main characters featured in the ''Pharsalia'' are terribly flawed and unattractive. Caesar, for instance, is presented as a successful military leader, but he strikes fear into the hearts of people and is extremely destructive.<ref name=braundxxi/> Lucan conveys this by using a simile (book 1, lines 151{{en dash}}7) that compares Caesar to a [[thunderbolt]]:\n\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|qualiter expressum uentis per nubila fulmen\naetheris inpulsi sonitu mundique fragore\nemicuit rupitque diem populosque pauentes\nterruit obliqua praestringens lumina flamma:\nin sua templa furit, nullaque exire uetante\nmateria magnamque cadens magnamque reuertens\ndat stragem late sparsosque recolligit ignes.}}\n|attr2=From Susanna Braund's 1992 translation<ref name=braundxxi>Braund (1992), p. xxi.</ref>|\nJust so flashes out the thunderbolt shot forth by the winds through clouds,\naccompanied by the crashing of the heavens and sound of shattered ether;\nit splits the sky and terrifies the panicked\npeople, searing eyes with slanting flame;\nagainst its own precincts it rages, and, with nothing solid stopping\nits course, both as it falls and then returns great is the devasation\ndealt far and wide before it gathers again its scattered fires.}}\n\nThroughout the ''Pharsalia'', this simile holds, and Caesar is continuously depicted as an active force, who strikes with great power.<ref>Rosner-Siegel, Judith (2010), p. 187.</ref>\n\nPompey, on the other hand, is old and past his prime, and years of peacetime have turned him soft.<ref name=braundxxi/> Susanna Braund argues that Lucan \"has taken the weaker, essentially ''human'', elements of Aeneas' character{{em dash}}Aeneas doubting his mission, Aeneas as husband and lover{{em dash}}and bestowed them upon Pompey.\"<ref name=braundxxii/> And while this portrays the leader as indecisive, slow to action, and ultimately ineffective, it does make him the only main character shown to have any sort of \"emotional life.\"<ref name=braundxxii>Braund (1992), p. xxii.</ref> What is more, Lucan at times explicitly roots for Pompey.<ref name=braundxxii/> But nevertheless, the leader is doomed in the end. Lucan compares Pompey to a large oak-tree (book 1, lines 136{{en dash}}43), which is still quite magnificent due to its size but on the verge of tipping over:\n\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|qualis frugifero quercus sublimis in agro\nexuuias ueteris populi sacrataque gestans\ndona ducum nec iam ualidis radicibus haerens\npondere fixa suo est, nudosque per aera ramos\neffundens trunco, non frondibus, efficit umbram,\net quamuis primo nutet casura sub Euro,\ntot circum siluae firmo se robore tollant,\nsola tamen colitur.}}\n|attr2=From Susanna Braund's 1992 translation<ref name=braundxxi>Braund (1992), p. xxi.</ref>|\nLike in a fruitful field, a lofty oak,\nbearing the people's spoils of old and generals'\nhallowed dedications; clinging with roots no longer strong,\nby its own weight it stands firm, and spreading naked branches\nthrough the air, it makes shade with trunk, not foliage;\nand though it totters, ready to fall beneath the first Eurus,\nthough all around so many trees upraise themselves with sturdy trunks,\nyet it alone is venerated.}}\n\nBy comparing Caesar to a bolt of lightning, and Pompey to a large tree on the verge of death, Lucan poetically implies early on in the ''Pharsalia'' that Caesar will strike and fell Pompey.<ref name=braundxxi/>\n\nThe grand exception to this generally bleak depiction of characters is Cato, who stands as a Stoic ideal in the face of a world gone mad (he alone, for example, refuses to consult oracles to know the future).  Pompey also seems transformed after Pharsalus, becoming a kind of stoic [[martyr]]; calm in the face of certain death upon arrival in Egypt, he receives virtual canonization from Lucan at the start of book IX.  This elevation of Stoic and Republican principles is in sharp contrast to the ambitious and imperial Caesar, who becomes an even greater monster after the decisive battle.  Even though Caesar wins in the end, Lucan makes his sentiments known in the famous line ''Victrix causa deis placuit sed Victa Catoni'' \u2013 \"The victorious cause pleased the gods, but the vanquished [cause] pleased Cato.\"\n\n=== Anti-imperialism ===\n\nGiven Lucan's clear anti-imperialism, the flattering Book I dedication to Nero \u2013 which includes lines like ''multum Roma tamen debet ciuilibus armis | quod tibi res acta est'' \u2013 \"But Rome is greater by these civil wars, because it resulted in you\"<ref>[[Lucan]], ''Pharsalia'', 1.44{{en dash}}5.</ref> \u2013 is somewhat puzzling.  Some scholars have tried to read these lines ironically, but most see it as a traditional dedication written at a time before the (supposed) true depravity of Lucan's patron was revealed.  The extant \"Lives\" of the poet support this interpretation, stating that a portion of the ''Pharsalia'' was in circulation before Lucan and Nero had their falling out.\n\nFurthermore, according to Braund, Lucan's negative portrayal of Caesar in the early portion of the poem was not likely meant as criticism of Nero, and it may have been Lucan's way of warning the new emperor about the issues of the past.<ref>Braund (1992), p. xv.</ref>\n\n=== Treatment of the supernatural ===\n\n[[File:Erichtho.jpg|thumb|In book six, [[Erichtho]] (''pictured'') performs a necromantic rite, which many contend is one of the ''Pharsalia''{{'s}} best-known sequences.]]\n\nLucan breaks from epic tradition by minimizing, and in certain cases, completely ignoring (and some argue, denying) the existence of the traditional Roman deities.<ref name=braund2009xxiii/><ref>Leigh (1997) p. 98, note 43.</ref> This is in marked contrast to his predecessors, Vergil and Ovid, who used anthropomorphized gods and goddesses as major players in their works. According to Susanna Braund, by choosing to not focus on the gods, Lucan emphasizes and underscores the human role in the atrocities of the Roman civil war.<ref name=braund2009xxiii>Braund (2009), pp. xxiii{{en dash}}xxiv.</ref> James Duff Duff, on the other hand, argues that \"[Lucan] was dealing with Roman history and with fairly recent events; and the introduction of the gods as actors must have been grotesque.\"<ref>Duff (1928), p. xiii.</ref>\n\nThis, however, is not to say that the ''Pharsalia'' is devoid of any supernatural phenomenon; in fact, quite the opposite is true, and Braund argues that \"the supernatural in all its manifestations played a highly significant part in the structuring of the epic.\"<ref>Braund (1992), p. xxix.</ref> Braund sees the supernatural as falling into two categories: \"dreams and visions\" and \"portents, prophecies, and consultations of supernatural powers\".<ref name=braund1992xxv>Braund (1992), p. xxv.</ref> In regards to the first category, the poem features four explicit and important dream and vision sequences: Caesar's vision of Roma as he is about to cross the Rubicon, the ghost of Julia appearing to Pompey, Pompey's dream of his happy past, and Caesar and his troops' dream of battle and destruction.<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxv{{en dash}}xxvii.</ref> All four of these dream-visions are placed strategically throughout the poem, \"to provide balance and contrast.\"<ref name=braund1992xxv/> In regards to the second category, Lucan describes a number portents,<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxvi{{en dash}}xxvii.</ref> two oracular episodes,<ref>Braund (1992), pp. xxvii{{en dash}}xxviii.</ref> and perhaps most famously Erichtho's necromantic rite.<ref name=\"Braund 1992, p. xxviii\">Braund (1992), p. xxviii.</ref> This manifestation of the supernatural is more public, and serves many purposes, including to reflect \"Rome's turmoil on the supernatural plane\", as well as simply to \"contribute to the atmosphere of sinster foreboding\" by describing disturbing rituals.<ref>Braund (1992), p. xxvii.</ref><ref name=\"Braund 1992, p. xxviii\"/>\n\n=== The poem as civil war ===\n\nAccording to Jamie Masters, Lucan's ''Pharsalia'' is not just a poem about a civil war, but rather in a metaphorical way ''is'' a civil war. In other words, he argues that Lucan embraces the metaphor of internal discord and allows it to determine the way the story is told by weaving it into the fabric of the poem itself.<ref name=masters10/><ref>Masters (1992), p. i.</ref> Masters proposes that Lucan's work is both \"Pompeian\" (in the sense that it celebrates the memory of Pompey, revels in delay, and decries the horrors of civil war) and \"Caesarian\" (in the sense that it still recounts Pompey's death, eventually overcomes delay, and describes the horrors of war in careful detail).<ref name=masters8-10>Masters (1992), pp. 8{{en dash}}10.</ref> Because Lucan is on both of the characters' sides whilst also supporting neither, the poem is inherently at war with itself.<ref name=masters10>Masters (1992), p. 10.</ref> Furthermore, because Lucan seems to place numerous obstacles before Caesar, he can be seen as opposing Caesar's actions. However, since Lucan still chooses to record them in song, he{{em dash}}being the poet and thus the one who has the final say on what goes into his work{{em dash}}is in some ways waging the war himself.<ref>Masters (1992), pp. 5{{en dash}}7.</ref> Ultimately, Masters refers to the binary opposition that he sees throughout the entire poem as Lucan's \"schizophrenic poetic persona\".<ref>Masters (1992), p. 9.</ref><ref>Davis (1993).</ref>\n\n=== Poetic representation of history ===\n\nThough the ''Pharsalia'' is an historical epic, it would be wrong to think Lucan is only interested in the details of history itself.  As one commentator has pointed out, Lucan is more concerned \"with the significance of events rather than the events themselves.\"<ref>Martindale (1976), p. 47.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Confederate Monument - E base - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|The base of the [[Confederate Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery)|Confederate Memorial]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in the United States, which is inscribed with Lucan's line, ''Victrix causa deis placuit sed victa Catoni''.]]\nLucan's work was popular in his own day and remained a school text in late antiquity and during the Middle Ages.  Over 400 manuscripts survive; its interest to the court of [[Charlemagne]] is evidenced by the existence of five complete manuscripts from the 9th century. [[Dante]] includes Lucan among other classical poets in the first circle of the ''[[Hell|Inferno]]'', and draws on the ''Pharsalia'' in the scene with Antaeus (a giant depicted in a story from Lucan's book IV).\n\n[[Christopher Marlowe]] published a translation of Book I,<ref>Gill (1973).</ref> while [[Thomas May]] followed with a complete translation into [[heroic couplet]]s in 1626.<ref name=watt>Watt (1824), p. 620.</ref> May later translated the remaining books and wrote a continuation of Lucan's incomplete poem.

One American example comes from the [[Confederate Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery)|Confederate Memorial]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], which has these words in Latin inscribed on its base.<ref>Smith (1920), p. 124.

Lake was best known for her  [[femme fatale]] roles in [[film noir]]s with [[Alan Ladd]] during the 1940s and her peek-a-boo hairstyle. By the late 1940s, Lake's career began to decline, due in part to her [[alcoholism]]. She made only one film in the 1950s, but made several [[guest appearance]]s on television. She returned to the big screen in 1966 in the film ''[[Footsteps in the Snow]]'' (1966), but the role failed to revitalize her career.\n\nLake's memoir, ''Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake'', was published in 1970.

Lake later claimed she attended [[McGill University]] and took a premed course for a year, intending to become a surgeon. This claim was included in several press biographies, although Lake later declared it was bogus.

Scathing reviews of ''The Hour Before the Dawn'' included criticism of her unconvincing German accent.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, and a growing number of people refused to work with her. Lake had a number of months off work, during which time she lost a child and was divorced.\n\nIn early 1944 she was brought back in ''[[Bring On the Girls (film)|Bring On the Girls]]'' (1945), Lake's first proper musical, although she had sung in ''This Gun for Hire'' and ''Star Spangled Rhythm''. She was teamed with [[Eddie Bracken]] and [[Sonny Tufts]]. The movie was not a financial success.\n\nIn June 1944, Lake appeared at a war bond drive in Boston, where her services as a dishwasher were auctioned off. She also performed in a revue, with papers saying her \"talk was on the grim side\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Tobin Shines As Butler At Bond Lunch: $100,000 Luncheon Served at Tobin Home|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|location=Boston|date=June 13, 1944|page=1}}</ref> [[Hedda Hopper]] later claimed this appearance was responsible for Paramount giving her the third lead in ''[[Out of This World (1945 film)|Out of This World]]'' (1945), supporting [[Diana Lynn]] and Bracken, saying \"Lake clipped her own wings in her Boston bond appearance ...

In November 1944 she made a third film with Bracken, ''[[Hold That Blonde]]'' (1945). She liked this part saying \"it's a comedy, rather like what [[Carole Lombard]] used to do ... It represents a real change of pace\".<ref name=\"edwin\">{{cite news|last=Schallert|first=Edwin|date=July 8, 1945|page=C1|title=Change of Pace in Roles Beckons Veronica Lake: Star to Pause at Career's Crossroads Roles to Shift for Veronica|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lake-ladd-trailer.jpg|thumb|left|222px|Lake and [[Alan Ladd]] in trailer for ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946)]]\nLake then made a second film produced by [[John Houseman]], ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946), which reunited her with Ladd. While waiting for the films to be released in 1945, she took stock of her career, claiming, \"I had to learn about acting. I've played all sorts of parts, taken just what came along regardless of high merit. In fact, I've been a sort of general utility person. I haven't liked all the roles. One or two were pretty bad\".<ref name=\"edwin\" />\n\nLake expressed interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:\n<blockquote>The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated they are going to fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about&nbsp;... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.<ref name=\"edwin\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince ''So Proudly We Hail'' only ''The Blue Dahlia'' had been a hit. She made her first film outside Paramount since she became a star, a Western, ''[[Ramrod (film)|Ramrod]]'' (1947), directed by her then-husband [[Andre DeToth]], which reunited her with Joel McCrea, despite his earlier reservation.  It was successful.\n\n===Final years at Paramount===\nBack at her home studio she had a cameo in ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947) then was united with Ladd for the last time in ''[[Saigon (1948 film)|Saigon]]'' (1948), in which she returned to her former peek-a-boo hairstyle; the movie was not particularly well received. Neither was a romantic drama, ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (also 1948) or a comedy ''[[The Sainted Sisters]]'' (1948). In 1948 Paramount decided not to renew Lake's contract. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Leaving Paramount===\nLake moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to make ''[[Slattery's Hurricane]]'' (1949), directed by DeToth.

Lake was best known for her  [[femme fatale]] roles in [[film noir]]s with [[Alan Ladd]] during the 1940s and her peek-a-boo hairstyle. By the late 1940s, Lake's career began to decline, due in part to her [[alcoholism]]. She made only one film in the 1950s, but made several [[guest appearance]]s on television. She returned to the big screen in 1966 in the film ''[[Footsteps in the Snow]]'' (1966), but the role failed to revitalize her career.\n\nLake's memoir, ''Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake'', was published in 1970.

Lake later claimed she attended [[McGill University]] and took a premed course for a year, intending to become a surgeon. This claim was included in several press biographies, although Lake later declared it was bogus.

Scathing reviews of ''The Hour Before the Dawn'' included criticism of her unconvincing German accent.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, and a growing number of people refused to work with her. Lake had a number of months off work, during which time she lost a child and was divorced.\n\nIn early 1944 she was brought back in ''[[Bring On the Girls (film)|Bring On the Girls]]'' (1945), Lake's first proper musical, although she had sung in ''This Gun for Hire'' and ''Star Spangled Rhythm''. She was teamed with [[Eddie Bracken]] and [[Sonny Tufts]]. The movie was not a financial success.\n\nIn June 1944, Lake appeared at a war bond drive in Boston, where her services as a dishwasher were auctioned off. She also performed in a revue, with papers saying her \"talk was on the grim side\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Tobin Shines As Butler At Bond Lunch: $100,000 Luncheon Served at Tobin Home|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|location=Boston|date=June 13, 1944|page=1}}</ref> [[Hedda Hopper]] later claimed this appearance was responsible for Paramount giving her the third lead in ''[[Out of This World (1945 film)|Out of This World]]'' (1945), supporting [[Diana Lynn]] and Bracken, saying \"Lake clipped her own wings in her Boston bond appearance ...

In November 1944 she made a third film with Bracken, ''[[Hold That Blonde]]'' (1945). She liked this part saying \"it's a comedy, rather like what [[Carole Lombard]] used to do ... It represents a real change of pace\".<ref name=\"edwin\">{{cite news|last=Schallert|first=Edwin|date=July 8, 1945|page=C1|title=Change of Pace in Roles Beckons Veronica Lake: Star to Pause at Career's Crossroads Roles to Shift for Veronica|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lake-ladd-trailer.jpg|thumb|left|222px|Lake and [[Alan Ladd]] in trailer for ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946)]]\nLake then made a second film produced by [[John Houseman]], ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946), which reunited her with Ladd. While waiting for the films to be released in 1945, she took stock of her career, claiming, \"I had to learn about acting. I've played all sorts of parts, taken just what came along regardless of high merit. In fact, I've been a sort of general utility person. I haven't liked all the roles. One or two were pretty bad\".<ref name=\"edwin\" />\n\nLake expressed interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:\n<blockquote>The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated they are going to fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about&nbsp;... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.<ref name=\"edwin\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince ''So Proudly We Hail'' only ''The Blue Dahlia'' had been a hit. She made her first film outside Paramount since she became a star, a Western, ''[[Ramrod (film)|Ramrod]]'' (1947), directed by her then-husband [[Andre DeToth]], which reunited her with Joel McCrea, despite his earlier reservation.  It was successful.\n\n===Final years at Paramount===\nBack at her home studio she had a cameo in ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947) then was united with Ladd for the last time in ''[[Saigon (1948 film)|Saigon]]'' (1948), in which she returned to her former peek-a-boo hairstyle; the movie was not particularly well received. Neither was a romantic drama, ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (also 1948) or a comedy ''[[The Sainted Sisters]]'' (1948). In 1948 Paramount decided not to renew Lake's contract. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Leaving Paramount===\nLake moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to make ''[[Slattery's Hurricane]]'' (1949), directed by DeToth.
