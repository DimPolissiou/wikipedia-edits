Dating back at least to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, and continuing to the present in some areas like [[Slaidburn]], farms were granted [[Fell farming|fell]] rights, allowing them access to common grazing land. To prevent [[overgrazing]], it was vitally important for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.\n\nThough fell rights are largely obsolete in modern agriculture except in upland areas, farms are often [[subsidy|subsidised]] and [[taxation|taxed]] according to the quantity of their sheep. For this reason, accurate counts are still necessary, and must be performed frequently.\n\nGenerally, a count is the first action performed in the morning and the last action performed at night. A count is made after moving the sheep from one pasture to another, and after any operation involving the sheep, such as [[sheep shearing|shearing]], [[Ear tag|tagging]], foot-trimming, [[mulesing]], etc., although sheep are far less likely to stray while being moved in a group than when grazing at large on open ground.\n\n== Origin and usage ==\n\nSheep-counting systems ultimately derive from [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages]], such as [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]; Tim Gay writes: \u201c[Sheep-counting systems from all over the British Isles] all compared very closely to 18th-century [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gay |first=Tim |title=Rural dialects and surviving Britons |url=https://reader.exacteditions.com/magazines/1291/search?q=yan |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=July 1999|issue=46 |url-access=subscription |page=18}}</ref> It is impossible, given the corrupted form in which they have survived, to be sure of their exact origin. The counting systems have changed considerably over time.  A particularly common tendency is for certain pairs of adjacent numbers to come to resemble each other by [[rhyme]] (notably 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9). Still, multiples of five tend to be fairly conservative; compare ''bumfit'' with Welsh ''pymtheg'', in contrast with standard English ''fifteen''.\n\nLike most Celtic numbering systems, they tend to be [[vigesimal]] ([[radix|based]] on the number [[20 (number)|twenty]]), but they usually lack words to describe quantities larger than twenty; though this is not a limitation of either modernised decimal Celtic counting systems or the older ones. To count a large number of sheep, a shepherd would repeatedly count to twenty, placing a mark on the ground, or move his hand to another mark on his crook, or drop a pebble into his pocket to represent each [[20 (number)|score]] (e.g. 5 score sheep = 100 sheep).\n\nTheir use is also attested in a knitting song from Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40wAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA205 |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |title=Knitting Song |author=R.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']], is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from mainstream favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nSquier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano for two years. Afterwards, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970's, he played in numerous small bands. One of these bands was Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]]. Squier also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nAfter Squier finished his short stint with a band called Sidewinders, he encountered first real experience with the music industry when in the mid 70's, he struck a record deal with his new band Piper, which went on to release two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group.\n\nDespite receiving considerable success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nSquier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Despite the problems, Squier's third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became very successful - though in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\". The latter is notable for being Squier's first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner and ascended into the heavyweight of early 80's hard rock. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref>\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: ''Signs of Life'' (1984)  ===\nSquier began to work on his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in late 1983. He planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the product, but he was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted Squier to continue his search just a few days before the sessions were set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer [[Jim Steinman]], who was better known for his grandiose pop ballads and operatic rock songs. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]] -'' which he had described as \"the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time\" - and Steinman was willing to work with a rock band, Squier stuck with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lick.htm|title=I'm Just Licking Them|website=Dream Pollution The Jim Steinman Web Site|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the time ''Signs of Life'' finally arrived in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by successful radio hits \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\" and \"All Night Long\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a sudden hit as soon as the homoerotic music video for \"Rock Me Tonite\", which actually had become his highest charting single in the US, premiered in the fall. It is best remembered for featuring Squier prancing around in a dark bedroom and ultimately tearing apart his ripped Emotions in Motion Tour tanktop, which he then replaces with a pink one. The video attracted embarrassed and negative responses from critics, fans, fellow musicians and Squier himself, who described it as \"diabolical\".

Squier lost his patience: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and for altering his own original concepts. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'', let alone both the video and the song \"Rock Me Tonite\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans.\n\n=== Brief resurgence and departure from Capitol: From ''Enough Is Enough'' to ''Tell the Truth'' (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few live appearances and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off and preparing his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. While the album was greeted with mostly warm reviews, many noted the lack of a clear hit and its amount of filler songs, though \"Love Is the Hero\" has been usually singled out for praise in usual reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_review.php?id=910|title=CRR Review - Billy Squier - Enough is Enough/Hear & Now/Creatures of Habit|website=www.classicrockrevisited.com|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Squier did not embark on a tour in support of the album.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''Enough Is Enough'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since 1984's \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Other notable tracks also included on the album are Squier's attempt on a late 80's power ballad, in the form of \"Don't Let Me Go\", as well as two [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\". All in all, the album did briefly restore Squier's success by returning to his early 1980's hard rock style. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's well received promotional tour, entitled All Excess, returned him on stages after almost five years of absence from touring. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade. In fact, the success of ''Hear & Now'' managed to just slow his ongoing popularity waning.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature notable radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" and \"Facts of Life\". The former stands as Squier's last Top 5 hit on Mainstream Rock charts and his highest charting radio single of the 90's. ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last bigger one for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and one of its songs, \"The Girl's All Right\", was later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists. The album's opening track, \"Angry\", was Squier's last Mainstream Rock hit.\n\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* ''[[A Rock and Roll Christmas]]'' (Various Artists Compilation) (1994)\n* ''16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier'' (1995)\n* ''Reach for the Sky: The Anthology'' (1996) (PolyGram)\n* ''Classic Masters'' (2002)\n* ''Absolute Hits'' (2005)\n* ''Essential Billy Squier'' (2011)\n* ''ICON'' (2013)\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* ''King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Billy Squier'' (1996)\n* ''Live In The Dark'' (DVD)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']], is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from mainstream favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nSquier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano for two years. Afterwards, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970's, he played in numerous small bands. One of these bands was Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]]. Squier also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nAfter Squier finished his short stint with a band called Sidewinders, he encountered first real experience with the music industry when in the mid 70's, he struck a record deal with his new band Piper, which went on to release two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group.\n\nDespite receiving considerable success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nSquier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Despite the problems, Squier's third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became very successful - though in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\". The latter is notable for being Squier's first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner and ascended into the heavyweight of early 80's hard rock. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref>\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: ''Signs of Life'' (1984)  ===\nSquier began to work on his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in late 1983. He planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the product, but he was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted Squier to continue his search just a few days before the sessions were set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer [[Jim Steinman]], who was better known for his grandiose pop ballads and operatic rock songs. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]] -'' which he had described as \"the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time\" - and Steinman was willing to work with a rock band, Squier stuck with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lick.htm|title=I'm Just Licking Them|website=Dream Pollution The Jim Steinman Web Site|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the time ''Signs of Life'' finally arrived in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by successful radio hits \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\" and \"All Night Long\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a sudden hit as soon as the homoerotic music video for \"Rock Me Tonite\", which actually had become his highest charting single in the US, premiered in the fall. It is best remembered for featuring Squier prancing around in a dark bedroom and ultimately tearing apart his ripped Emotions in Motion Tour tanktop, which he then replaces with a pink one. The video attracted embarrassed and negative responses from critics, fans, fellow musicians and Squier himself, who described it as \"diabolical\". It has been later cited as one of the worst music videos of all time.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales took a damage; ''Signs of Life'' ended up stalling at #11 on the Billboard 200 and he stopped selling out shows. Squier lost his patience: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and for altering his own original concepts. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'', let alone both the video and the song \"Rock Me Tonite\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans.\n\n=== Brief resurgence and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few live appearances and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off and preparing his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. While the album was greeted with mostly warm reviews, many noted the lack of a clear hit and its amount of filler songs, though \"Love Is the Hero\" has been usually singled out for praise in usual reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_review.php?id=910|title=CRR Review - Billy Squier - Enough is Enough/Hear & Now/Creatures of Habit|website=www.classicrockrevisited.com|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Squier did not embark on a tour in support of the album.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''Enough Is Enough'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since 1984's \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Other notable tracks also included on the album are Squier's attempt on a late 80's power ballad, in the form of \"Don't Let Me Go\", as well as two [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\". All in all, the album did briefly restore Squier's success by returning to his early 1980's hard rock style. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's well received promotional tour, entitled All Excess, returned him on stages after almost five years of absence from touring. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade. In fact, the success of ''Hear & Now'' managed to just slow his ongoing popularity waning.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature notable radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" and \"Facts of Life\". The former stands as Squier's last Top 5 hit on Mainstream Rock charts and his highest charting radio single of the 90's. ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last bigger one for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and one of its songs, \"The Girl's All Right\", was later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists. The album's opening track, \"Angry\", was Squier's last Mainstream Rock hit.\n\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* ''[[A Rock and Roll Christmas]]'' (Various Artists Compilation) (1994)\n* ''16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier'' (1995)\n* ''Reach for the Sky: The Anthology'' (1996) (PolyGram)\n* ''Classic Masters'' (2002)\n* ''Absolute Hits'' (2005)\n* ''Essential Billy Squier'' (2011)\n* ''ICON'' (2013)\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* ''King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Billy Squier'' (1996)\n* ''Live In The Dark'' (DVD)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

(Picture by [[George Silk]].)]]\n\n'''Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels''' was the name given by [[Australian Army|Australian]] soldiers to [[Papua New Guinean people|Papua New Guinean]] war carriers who, during [[World War II]], were recruited to bring supplies up to the front and carry injured Australian troops down the [[Kokoda trail]] during the [[Kokoda Campaign]]. \"[[Fuzzy-Wuzzy]]\" was originally used by [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers in the 19th century as a name for [[Hadendoa]] warriors on the [[Red Sea]] coast of the [[Sudan]], and referred to their elaborate butter-matted hairstyles. \n\n==History==\nIn 1942, during the Pacific invasion, the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] had built up a force of 13,500 in the [[Gona]] region of Papua with the intention of invading [[Port Moresby]]. The key to the offensive was an overland trail across the [[Owen Stanley Range|Owen Stanley Ranges]]. The trail ranged from the small village of Buna on the north coast of [[Papua (Australian territory)|Papua]] and went up the slopes through Gorari and Oivi to [[Kokoda]]. The trail was approximately {{convert|160|km|mi}} long, folded into a series of ridges, rising higher and to {{convert|2100|m|ft}} and then declining again to {{convert|900|m|ft}}. It was covered in thick jungle, short trees and tall trees tangled with vines.\n\nIn June 1942, Australian Major General [[Basil Morris]] issued an \"Employment of Natives Order\", which allowed native Papuans to be recruited as carriers for three years. Between August and December that year, around 16,000 Papuans were recruited, often with false promises such as a shorter period of service or a less difficult working condition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Remembering the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels |url=http://kokodahistorical.com.au/images/graphics/PNG-Air-Mag-12-Text-Fuzzy-Wuzzy.pdf |website=kokodahistorical.com.au}}</ref> In some occasions, the Papuans were forced into service.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rogerson |first1=Emma |title=The \u201cFuzzy Wuzzy Angels\u201d: looking beyond the myth |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/sites/default/files/svss_2012_rogerson_paper.pdf |publisher=The Australian War Memorial|date=2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 August 1942, the Japanese task force broke through the Australian line forcing the Australians to retreat further back to [[Templeton's Crossing]].

In 1984 he had his work exhibited at the inauguration of the Trump Tower.\n\n==== ''Body Works'' ====\nIn the late 80s and early 90s Marchant created a photographic series of ''Body Works'', where naked bodies constitute a denunciation of the hedonistic and alienating practices to which the female form is submitted, a denunciation of the repression and mystification to which women's education exposes them from every direction. And they are an affirmation of the real sensuality of women, which respectability nonetheless still attempts to hide or to repress (the curtain or the mosquito net). And so, like gallery owner Romana Loda, we can quote [[Hugo Von Hofmannsthal]] when he said: \"The profound should be hidden. Where? On the surface\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Avogadro|first=Gina|title=Personaggi \u2013 Within every woman there lies a tiger|date=24 February 1981|publisher=Il Giorno}} Quoted in \"[http://www.gretta.info/body_works.html Body Works 1976]\", Sarfaty Marchant's website.</ref>\n[[File:Gretta & Becheroni 1980.jpg|thumb|Gretta Sarfaty,1980.

Marchant perform in a cube made of paper ribbons, making herself a passage through the space. It is a metaphoric way to the new identity.

Marchant expresses in this series the notion of ''gender performativity'', a term created by [[Judith Butler]] in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nRoberto Pontual wrote about this work:\n\n<blockquote>The work of Gretta has been originally more related to the language of photography, especially during her recent stay in Europe.

She also started to discover [[Kabbalah]] esoteric thought: she became friends with [[Simon Jacobson]] and [[Kenny Vance]] and she decided to picture the [[Kabbalah]] community in her paintings (''Kabbalah'', 1984\u20131985). She also created a performance, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVOusq5B9Zg Goya Time]'' (1985) and a video, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ckb6n5PIE4 My Single Life in New York]'' (1987).\n\nBy the time she was represented by the New York-based gallery, Foster Goldstrom Fine Arts, she was involved in the artistic and cultural life of the city and she got to know [[Arthur Penn]], with whom she collaborated in 1993 on his film ''The [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107859/ Portrait]''.\n\nSome important exhibitions held in New York were ''Body Works'' at the Foster Goldstrom Gallery in 1983. The same year he participated in the ''Body Works & Evocative Recollections'' at the Keith Green Gallery. In 1984 he had his work exhibited at the inauguration of the Trump Tower.\n\n==== ''Body Works'' ====\nIn the late 80s and early 90s Marchant created a photographic series of ''Body Works'', where naked bodies constitute a denunciation of the hedonistic and alienating practices to which the female form is submitted, a denunciation of the repression and mystification to which women's education exposes them from every direction. And they are an affirmation of the real sensuality of women, which respectability nonetheless still attempts to hide or to repress (the curtain or the mosquito net). And so, like gallery owner Romana Loda, we can quote [[Hugo Von Hofmannsthal]] when he said: \"The profound should be hidden. Where? On the surface\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Avogadro|first=Gina|title=Personaggi \u2013 Within every woman there lies a tiger|date=24 February 1981|publisher=Il Giorno}} Quoted in \"[http://www.gretta.info/body_works.html Body Works 1976]\", Sarfaty Marchant's website.</ref>\n[[File:Gretta & Becheroni 1980.jpg|thumb|Gretta Sarfaty,1980.

Marchant perform in a cube made of paper ribbons, making herself a passage through the space. It is a metaphoric way to the new identity. This work evidences the prison of the woman in the society through its voyeuristic aspect, evoking a ritual of liberation. This work was exhibited in the Pinacoteca do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo and in other countries like Argentina, Italy and the USA.

From 2005, he founded his own ''[[Artist-run space|artist-run gallery]]'', [[Sartorial Contemporary Art]]s, a gallery designed to promote exhibitions of young artists as well as his own.\n\n==== ''Reflections of a Woman'' ====\nWoman as a central artistic subject appears not only in her auto-portraits but also in the series of paintings dedicated to an issue of female [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and body, ''Reflections of a Woman'' (1997).

The series consists of one photographic image which is duplicated several times to form a stimulating kaleidoscopic final picture. The Myth of Womanhood marks Gretta's return to performance art, however in this instance the performance is only for the camera. \n[[File:YOUTH VERSUS GRAVITY 2001-2005 mirkwood 2000.jpg|left|thumb|Gretta Sarfaty, 2001-2005.

Separate images were used to create fun compositions through symmetry, which are intended to transport the viewer back to the illusion of childhood. In ''Youth Versus Gravity,'' the artist has been guided by issues related to longevity.\n[[File:Sartorial Contemporary Art, Permutations Gretta Sarfaty Marchant May 1st - 23rd May 2009.jpg|left|thumb|Gretta Sarfaty, 2009.

In October 2008 this moved to a larger space in Kings Cross. Marchant has curated several of its shows including ''Notting Heaven'' (2008), ''Mothers'' (2008), ''Remember My Name'' (2008), ''Burning Candy'' (2008), ''Obsession'' (2006) and ''Water'' (2006).

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees.

Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived.

The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander.

Suffren attempted to give chase, but the [[copper sheathing]] of the British warship gave them a decisive advantage, and he abandoned the pursuit to help with the capture of the merchantmen.<ref name=cunat42 />{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After the battle, Suffren wrote a letter to [[Antoine de Sartine]], [[Secretary of State of the Navy (France)|Secretary of State of the Navy]], to advocate for the French Navy to copper is own ships.<ref name=cunat44>Cunat, p.44</ref><ref>The full text of Suffren's memorandum on copper sheating is quoted in Cunat, p.353-354</ref>\n\n===Campaign in the Indian Ocean===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], France and the [[Dutch Republic]] found themselves allied against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The Dutch expected the British to send an expeditionary force to try and capture their [[Dutch Cape Colony]], and Suffren was given command of a 5-ship squadron to reinforce it. The task force comprised the 74-gun [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1778)|''H\u00e9ros'']] (under Suffren) and [[French ship Annibal (1778)|''Annibal'']] (under [[Achille de Tr\u00e9migon|Tr\u00e9mignon]]), and the 64-gun [[French ship Art\u00e9sien|''Art\u00e9sien'']] (under Cardaillac), [[French ship Sphinx (1776)|''Sphinx'']] (under du Chilleau) and [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] (under Forbin), <ref name=cunat48>Cunat, p.48</ref> as well as the 16-gun corvette [[French corvette Fortune (1780)|''Fortune'']] (under Captain de Lusignan), and seven transports <ref name=cunat49>Cunat, p.49</ref> carrying the [[107th Infantry Regiment (France)|R\u00e9giment de Pondich\u00e9ry]], under Brigadier General [[Thomas Conway]].<ref name=cunat63>Cunat, p.63</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Porto Praya ====\n{{Main|Battle of Porto Praya}}\nThe squadron departed Brest on 22 March 1781.

Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy, which the French pressed into their service as ''Petit Annibal''.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Sadras ====\n{{Main|Battle of Sadras}}\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and [[Chevalier de Villeneuve-Cillart|Cillart]] that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; [[Jean Andr\u00e9 de Pas de Beaulieu|Beaulieu]] went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

The French troops reembarked on their transports, when ''Bellone'', which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam. Suffren ordered an immediate departure and found the British ships anchored when he arrived on 6 July 1782.<ref name=Hennequin303>Hennequin, p.303</ref> Before the battle, Suffren despatched [[French frigate Pourvoyeuse (1772)|''Pourvoyeuse'']] to [[Malacca]], [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''R\u00e9solution'']] to [[Manila]], and [[Fortitude (1780 EIC ship)|''Fortitude'']] and [[Yarmouth (1782 ship)|''Yarmouth'']] to Isle de France, to purchase spare [[Spar (sailing)|spars]], food and ammunition to resupply his fleet.

Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived.

The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] called him \"perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced'.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref> In ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\n[[R\u00e9mi Monaque]] offers a more nuanced assessment, finding Suffren an aggressive and innovative commander comparable to Ruyter and Nelson,<ref name=Monaque-pon-91>Monaque, ''A Precursor of Nelson'', p.91</ref> but also one whose lack of didactic qualities and social graces made misunderstood and disliked by his captains, and thus failed to develop its full potential. <ref name=Monaque-pon-90>Monaque, ''A Precursor of Nelson'', p.90</ref>\n\n=== Monuments and memorials ===\n{{see also|French ship Suffren}}\n[[French ship Suffren|Eight ships]] of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez. \n\nA number of streets and avenues through France are named in Suffren's honour.
