The history of Buddhism in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhist culture were established around the same period. The Indonesian archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful Buddhist empires such as [[Sailendra]] dynasty, [[Srivijaya]] and [[Medang Kingdom|Mataram]] Empires. The arrival of Buddhism was started with trading activities that began in the early first century on the [[Silk Road]] between Indonesia and India. According to some Chinese sources, a Chinese monk on his journey to India, witnessed the powerful maritime empire of Srivijaya based in [[Sumatra]]. The empire also served as a Buddhist learning centre in the region. Some [[Cultural heritage|historical heritage]] monuments can be found in Indonesia, including the Borobudur Temple in [[Yogyakarta]] and statues or ''prasasti'' (inscriptions) from the earlier history of Buddhist empires.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinney; Klokke; Kieven|1y=2003|1pp=17\u201320|2a1=Levenda|2y=2011|2pp=|3a1=Domenig|3y=2014|3pp=}}\n\nFollowing the downfall of President Sukarno in the mid-1960s and the mandatory policy of having a religion,<ref>cf.

However, the figures are likely higher, since practitioners of Confucianism and [[Taoism]], which are not considered official religions of Indonesia, referred to themselves as Buddhists on the census. Today, most Buddhists are [[Chinese Indonesians]] and, to a lesser extent, among the Javanese and Balinese. Among the Indonesian Buddhists follow major Buddhist schools: [[Mahayana]], [[Vajrayana]], and [[Theravada]]. Most Chinese Indonesians follow a syncretic flow with Chinese beliefs, such as the [[Three teachings]] (Tridharma) and [[Yiguandao]] (Maytreya).{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=1987|1pp=108\u201317|2a1=Brown|2y=1990|2p=|3a1=Cheu|3y=1999|3p=|4a1=Hauser-Sch\u00e4ublin; Harnish|4y=2014|4pp=84\u2013112|5a1=Kimura|5y=2003|5pp=53\u201372|6a1=Syryadinata|6y=2005|6pp=77\u201394}}\n\n=== Confucianism ===\n{{Main|Confucianism in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Guan She Yin statue of Sanggar Agung Temple, Surabaya-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Chinese temple of [[Sanggar Agung]], in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]].]]\n[[Confucianism]] originated in [[China]] and was brought to Indonesia by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants as early as the 3rd century AD. Unlike other religions, Confucianism evolved more into loose individual practices and belief in the [[code of conduct]], rather than a well-organised community with a sound theology\u2014akin to a way of life or [[social movement]] than a religion. It was not until the early 1900s that Confucianists formed an organisation, called ''Khong Kauw Hwe'' (THHK) in Batavia.{{sfn|Cheu|1999|pp=}}{{sfn|Syryadinata|2005|pp=77\u201394}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nAfter the Indonesian independence in 1945, Confucianism was affected by several political conflicts. In 1965, [[Sukarno]] issued Presidential Decree No. 1/Pn.Ps/1965, recognising that six religions are embraced by the Indonesian people, including [[Confucianism]]. In 1961, the ''Association of Khung Chiao Hui Indonesia'' (PKCHI) (now the [[Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia]]) had declared that Confucianism is a religion and [[Confucius]] is their [[prophet]].{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nDuring the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]], the [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia|anti-China policy]] became a scapegoat-like method to gain political support from the masses, especially after the fall of PKI, which had allegedly been backed by China. In 1967, Suharto issued controversial Presidential Instruction No. 14/1967, which effectively banned Chinese culture, including documents printed in Chinese, expressions of Chinese belief, Chinese celebrations and festivities, and even Chinese names. However, Suharto acknowledged that the [[Chinese Indonesian]]s had a large amount of wealth and power, despite consisting only 3% of the population.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nIn 1969, [[Statute]] No. 5/1969 was passed, restoring the official total of six religions. However, it was not always put into practice. In 1978, the Minister of Home Affairs issued a directive asserting there are only five religions, excluding Confucianism. On 27 January 1979, a presidential cabinet meeting decided that Confucianism is not a religion. Another Minister of Home Affairs directive in 1990 re-iterated the total of five official religions in Indonesia.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}} Therefore, the status of Confucianism during the New Order regime was never clear. ''De jure'', there were conflicting laws, because higher laws permitted Confucianism, but lower ones did not recognise it. ''De facto'', Confucianists were not recognised by the government, and they were forced to register with one of the original five official religions to maintain their citizenship. This practice was applied in many places, including the national registration card, marriage registration, and family registration card. Civics education in Indonesia taught school children that there are only five official religions.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nFollowing the fall of Suharto in 1998, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] was elected as the country's fourth president. He rescinded the 1967 Presidential Instruction and the 1978 Home Affairs Ministry directive, and Confucianism once again became officially recognised as a religion in Indonesia. Chinese culture and activities were again permitted. However, after the implementation of Regional Autonomy laws, provinces and regencies were permitted to control their own administrative procedures. This resulted in some administrative districts permitting only five religions on the KTP, a restriction that have been programmed into computer databases.{{sfn|Syryadinata|2005|pp=77\u201394}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\n== Indigenous religions ==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Het verslepen van de steen 'Darodaro' voor de gestorven Saoenigeho van Bawamataloea Nias TMnr 1000095b.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nias]] tribesmen moving and erecting a [[megalith]], ca. 1915.]]\n{{Main|Aliran kepercayaan}}\n{{See also|Mythology of Indonesia}}\nA number of ancestral [[Animism|animistic]] [[indigenous religions]] ([[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] ethnic beliefs) are present, which were dominant throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Dharmic and Abrahamic religions.

Because of this, followers of these beliefs such as Dayak Kaharingan have identified themselves as Hindu as a result to avoid pressure to convert to Islam or Christianity. Several native tribal beliefs such as Sunda Wiwitan, Toraja Aluk Todolo, and Batak Parmalim \u2014 although different from Indian-influenced Balinese Hinduism \u2014 might seek affiliation with Hinduism to survive, while at the same time also preserving their distinction from mainstream Indonesian Hinduism dominated by the Balinese.

The beliefs are rooted in [[Javanese people|Javanese]] history and spiritualism with the tendency to [[Syncretism|syncretise]] aspects of different religions in search for a common ground. ''Kejaw\u00e8n'' is generally characterised as mystical, and some varieties were concerned with spiritual self-control. Although there were many varieties circulating in 1992, ''Kejaw\u00e8n'' often implies pantheistic worship because it encourages sacrifices and devotions to local and ancestral spirits. These spirits are believed to inhabit natural objects, human beings, artefacts, and grave sites of the important wali (Muslim saints). Illness and other misfortunes are traced to such spirits, and if sacrifices or pilgrimages fail to placate angry deities, the advice of a ''[[dukun]]'' or healer is sought. ''Kejaw\u00e8n'', while it connotes a turning away from the aggressive universalism of orthodox Islam, moves toward a more internalised universalism. In this way, Kebatinan moves toward eliminating the distinction between the universal and the local, the communal and the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Beatty|1y=1999|1p=|2a1=Epton|2y=1974|2p=|3a1=Geertz|3y=1960|3p=|4a1=Hadiwijono|4y=1967|4p=|5a1=Koentjaraningrat|5y=1987|5pp=559\u201363|6a1=Kroef|6y=1961|6pp=18\u201325|7a1=Mulder|7y=1998|7p=|8a1=Schlehe|8y=1998|8p=|9a1=Schlehe|9y=2019|9pp=364\u201386|10a1=Stange|10y=1980|10p=|11a1=Suparyanto|11y=2019|11p=}}\n\nThe ''Kejaw\u00e8n'' have no certain prophet, a sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals; it has more to do with each adherent's internalised transcendental vision and beliefs in their relations with others and with the supreme being. As a result, there is an inclusiveness that the ''kebatinan'' believer could identify themselves with one of six officially recognised religions, at least in KTP, while still subscribe to their ''kebatinan'' belief and way of life. This loosely organised current of thought and practice was legitimised in the 1945 constitution and, in 1973, when it was recognised as ''Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa'' ({{lang-id|Believer of One Supreme God}}) that somewhat gain the status as one of the ''agama''.

During the New Order, President [[Suharto]] proposed the [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia|Anti-Chinese law]] which prohibits anything related to [[Chinese culture]], including names and religions. Suharto also made an effort to \"de-Islamicise\" the government, by maintaining a large proportion of Christians in his cabinet. However, in the early 1990s, the issue of [[Islamisation]] appeared, and the military split into two groups, the Nationalist and Islamic camps. The latter, led by General [[Prabowo Subianto]], was in favour of Islamisation, while General [[Wiranto]] was in the former in favour of a secular state. {{sfn|Geertz|1972|pp=62\u201384}}{{sfn|Lindsey; Pausacker|1995|p=}}{{sfn|Lidde|1996|pp=613\u2013634}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2004|pp=34\u2013104}}\n\nDuring the New Order, the [[transmigration program]] continued after it was initiated by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government in the early nineteenth century. The intention was to move millions of people from overcrowded and populated [[Java]], Bali and [[Madura Island|Madura]] to less populated regions, such as [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. It has received much criticism, being described as a type of colonisation by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] who also brought Islam to non-Muslim areas. Citizens in western Indonesia are mostly Muslims with Christians a small minority, while in eastern regions, the Christian populations are similar in size or larger than the Muslim population. This more even population distribution has led to more religious conflicts in the eastern regions, including [[Poso riots]] and the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]] communal violence since the resignation of President Suharto.{{sfnm|1a1=Lindsey; Pausacker|1y=1995|1p=|2a1=Bertrand|2y=2004|2pp=34\u2013104|3a1=Pringle|3y=2010|3pp=143\u201357|4a1=Crouch|4y=2013|4p=|5a1=Duncan|5y=2013|5p=}}\n\nThe government has made an effort to reduce the tension by proposing the inter-religion cooperation plan. The Foreign Ministry, along with the most prominent Islamic organisation in Indonesia, [[Nahdatul Ulama]], held the International Conference of Islamic Scholars, to promote Islamic moderation, which is believed to reduce the tension in the country.<ref name=\"kbriconf\">{{cite press release|title=Transcript of Joint Press Conference Indonesian Foreign Minister, Hassan Wirajuda, with Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer|publisher=Embassy of Republic of Indonesia at Canberra, Australia|date=6 December 2004|url=http://www.kbri-canberra.org.au/speeches/2004/041206interfaith.htm |access-date=14 October 2006}}</ref> On 6 December 2004, the \"Dialogue On Interfaith Cooperation: Community Building and Harmony\" conference was opened.

In one incident in Madura, local villagers surrounded Shia houses and demanded they desist religious activities, but the crowd was dispersed by local leaders and clergy.{{sfn|Zulkifli|2011|p=}}{{sfn|Ida|2016|pp=194\u2013215}} On the issue of the [[Ahmadiyya]] , Indonesia has failed to act and uphold their human rights.

For example, the dispute over a Bethel Injil Sepenuh Church (GBIS) in Jakarta was due to land dispute dating back to 1957, while the [[Indonesia Christian Church]] (GKI) Taman Yasmin dispute in [[Bogor]] was due to the municipal government plan to turn the church's area into a business district. The Taman Yasmin Church in Bogor has been upheld and protected by [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]], but the mayor of Bogor refused to comply with the court ruling.<ref>{{cite news|title=Business interests blamed for church rows|newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=24 August 2011|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/24/business-interests-blamed-church-rows.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Holtz|first=Michael|title=Indonesian mayor seeks to ban church construction|agency=Associated Press|date=24 August 2011|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gIXp0SLB0t8dLEM5vN1DjR1KNssA?docId=27135628f19a40e2a03f751d80b19d85}}</ref> A positive form of relations has also appeared in society, such as the effort from six different religious organisations to help the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] victims.

For the Dutch, economic benefit rather than religious conversion were paramount, and missionary efforts avoided predominantly Muslim areas such as Java. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) regulated the missionary work so it could serve its own interests and focused it to the eastern, Animist part of the archipelago, including [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], [[North Sulawesi]], [[Nusa Tenggara]], [[Western New Guinea|Papua]] and [[Kalimantan]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PMSTAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=ru&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set] by Hans J.

Many Portuguese had the goal of spreading Roman Catholicism, starting with the [[Maluku Islands]]) in 1534. Between 1546 and 1547, the pioneer Christian missionary, Saint [[Francis Xavier]], visited the islands and [[baptised]] several thousand locals. During the VOC era, the number of Roman Catholicism practitioners fell significantly, due to VOC policy of banning the religion. The hostility of the Dutch toward Catholicism is due to its history where the Protestant Dutch gained their independence after the [[Eighty Years War]] against Catholic Spain's rule. The most significant result was on the island of [[Flores]] and [[East Timor]] where VOC concentrated. Moreover, Roman Catholic priests were sent to prisons or punished and replaced by Protestant clergy from the Netherlands. One Roman Catholic priest was executed for celebrating [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in prison during [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]]'s tenure as [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]].

The history of Buddhism in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhist culture were established around the same period. The Indonesian archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful Buddhist empires such as [[Sailendra]] dynasty, [[Srivijaya]] and [[Medang Kingdom|Mataram]] Empires. The arrival of Buddhism was started with trading activities that began in the early first century on the [[Silk Road]] between Indonesia and India. According to some Chinese sources, a Chinese monk on his journey to India, witnessed the powerful maritime empire of Srivijaya based in [[Sumatra]].

Unlike other religions, Confucianism evolved more into loose individual practices and belief in the [[code of conduct]], rather than a well-organised community with a sound theology\u2014akin to a way of life or [[social movement]] than a religion.

In 1965, [[Sukarno]] issued Presidential Decree No. 1/Pn.Ps/1965, recognising that six religions are embraced by the Indonesian people, including [[Confucianism]]. In 1961, the ''Association of Khung Chiao Hui Indonesia'' (PKCHI) (now the [[Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia]]) had declared that Confucianism is a religion and [[Confucius]] is their [[prophet]].{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nDuring the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]], the [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia|anti-China policy]] became a scapegoat-like method to gain political support from the masses, especially after the fall of PKI, which had allegedly been backed by China.

However, Suharto acknowledged that the [[Chinese Indonesian]]s had a large amount of wealth and power, despite consisting only 3% of the population.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nIn 1969, [[Statute]] No. 5/1969 was passed, restoring the official total of six religions. However, it was not always put into practice. In 1978, the Minister of Home Affairs issued a directive asserting there are only five religions, excluding Confucianism. On 27 January 1979, a presidential cabinet meeting decided that Confucianism is not a religion. Another Minister of Home Affairs directive in 1990 re-iterated the total of five official religions in Indonesia.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}} Therefore, the status of Confucianism during the New Order regime was never clear. ''De jure'', there were conflicting laws, because higher laws permitted Confucianism, but lower ones did not recognise it. ''De facto'', Confucianists were not recognised by the government, and they were forced to register with one of the original five official religions to maintain their citizenship. This practice was applied in many places, including the national registration card, marriage registration, and family registration card. Civics education in Indonesia taught school children that there are only five official religions.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\nFollowing the fall of Suharto in 1998, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] was elected as the country's fourth president. He rescinded the 1967 Presidential Instruction and the 1978 Home Affairs Ministry directive, and Confucianism once again became officially recognised as a religion in Indonesia. Chinese culture and activities were again permitted. However, after the implementation of Regional Autonomy laws, provinces and regencies were permitted to control their own administrative procedures. This resulted in some administrative districts permitting only five religions on the KTP, a restriction that have been programmed into computer databases.{{sfn|Syryadinata|2005|pp=77\u201394}}{{sfn|Chambert-Loir|2015|pp=67\u2013107}}\n\n== Indigenous religions ==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Het verslepen van de steen 'Darodaro' voor de gestorven Saoenigeho van Bawamataloea Nias TMnr 1000095b.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nias]] tribesmen moving and erecting a [[megalith]], ca. 1915.]]\n{{Main|Aliran kepercayaan}}\n{{See also|Mythology of Indonesia}}\nA number of ancestral [[Animism|animistic]] [[indigenous religions]] ([[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] ethnic beliefs) are present, which were dominant throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Dharmic and Abrahamic religions.

The beliefs are rooted in [[Javanese people|Javanese]] history and spiritualism with the tendency to [[Syncretism|syncretise]] aspects of different religions in search for a common ground. ''Kejaw\u00e8n'' is generally characterised as mystical, and some varieties were concerned with spiritual self-control. Although there were many varieties circulating in 1992, ''Kejaw\u00e8n'' often implies pantheistic worship because it encourages sacrifices and devotions to local and ancestral spirits. These spirits are believed to inhabit natural objects, human beings, artefacts, and grave sites of the important wali (Muslim saints). Illness and other misfortunes are traced to such spirits, and if sacrifices or pilgrimages fail to placate angry deities, the advice of a ''[[dukun]]'' or healer is sought. ''Kejaw\u00e8n'', while it connotes a turning away from the aggressive universalism of orthodox Islam, moves toward a more internalised universalism. In this way, Kebatinan moves toward eliminating the distinction between the universal and the local, the communal and the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Beatty|1y=1999|1p=|2a1=Epton|2y=1974|2p=|3a1=Geertz|3y=1960|3p=|4a1=Hadiwijono|4y=1967|4p=|5a1=Koentjaraningrat|5y=1987|5pp=559\u201363|6a1=Kroef|6y=1961|6pp=18\u201325|7a1=Mulder|7y=1998|7p=|8a1=Schlehe|8y=1998|8p=|9a1=Schlehe|9y=2019|9pp=364\u201386|10a1=Stange|10y=1980|10p=|11a1=Suparyanto|11y=2019|11p=}}\n\nThe ''Kejaw\u00e8n'' have no certain prophet, a sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals; it has more to do with each adherent's internalised transcendental vision and beliefs in their relations with others and with the supreme being. As a result, there is an inclusiveness that the ''kebatinan'' believer could identify themselves with one of six officially recognised religions, at least in KTP, while still subscribe to their ''kebatinan'' belief and way of life. This loosely organised current of thought and practice was legitimised in the 1945 constitution and, in 1973, when it was recognised as ''Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa'' ({{lang-id|Believer of One Supreme God}}) that somewhat gain the status as one of the ''agama''.

During the New Order, President [[Suharto]] proposed the [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia|Anti-Chinese law]] which prohibits anything related to [[Chinese culture]], including names and religions. Suharto also made an effort to \"de-Islamicise\" the government, by maintaining a large proportion of Christians in his cabinet. However, in the early 1990s, the issue of [[Islamisation]] appeared, and the military split into two groups, the Nationalist and Islamic camps. The latter, led by General [[Prabowo Subianto]], was in favour of Islamisation, while General [[Wiranto]] was in the former in favour of a secular state. {{sfn|Geertz|1972|pp=62\u201384}}{{sfn|Lindsey; Pausacker|1995|p=}}{{sfn|Lidde|1996|pp=613\u2013634}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2004|pp=34\u2013104}}\n\nDuring the New Order, the [[transmigration program]] continued after it was initiated by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government in the early nineteenth century. The intention was to move millions of people from overcrowded and populated [[Java]], Bali and [[Madura Island|Madura]] to less populated regions, such as [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. It has received much criticism, being described as a type of colonisation by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] who also brought Islam to non-Muslim areas. Citizens in western Indonesia are mostly Muslims with Christians a small minority, while in eastern regions, the Christian populations are similar in size or larger than the Muslim population. This more even population distribution has led to more religious conflicts in the eastern regions, including [[Poso riots]] and the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]] communal violence since the resignation of President Suharto.{{sfnm|1a1=Lindsey; Pausacker|1y=1995|1p=|2a1=Bertrand|2y=2004|2pp=34\u2013104|3a1=Pringle|3y=2010|3pp=143\u201357|4a1=Crouch|4y=2013|4p=|5a1=Duncan|5y=2013|5p=}}\n\nThe government has made an effort to reduce the tension by proposing the inter-religion cooperation plan.

For example, the dispute over a Bethel Injil Sepenuh Church (GBIS) in Jakarta was due to land dispute dating back to 1957, while the [[Indonesia Christian Church]] (GKI) Taman Yasmin dispute in [[Bogor]] was due to the municipal government plan to turn the church's area into a business district. The Taman Yasmin Church in Bogor has been upheld and protected by [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]], but the mayor of Bogor refused to comply with the court ruling.<ref>{{cite news|title=Business interests blamed for church rows|newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=24 August 2011|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/24/business-interests-blamed-church-rows.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Holtz|first=Michael|title=Indonesian mayor seeks to ban church construction|agency=Associated Press|date=24 August 2011|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gIXp0SLB0t8dLEM5vN1DjR1KNssA?docId=27135628f19a40e2a03f751d80b19d85}}</ref> A positive form of relations has also appeared in society, such as the effort from six different religious organisations to help the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] victims.
