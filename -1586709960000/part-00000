The town is near Bagan Lalang beach and Golden Coast Sepang. It has numerous [[mangrove]] forests and the local clay supports a thriving brick-making industry.\n\n==Etymology==\nLocal legend has it that Sungai Pelek got its name from the temporary river formed by the overflow of the Sungai Sepang and Sungai Sepang Kecil during high tide. In the local Malay dialect, \"sungai\" meant \"river, and \"pelek\" meant \"strange\" or \"unusual\".\n\nThis \"strange/unusual\" river lasted only for as long as the high tide, as most of the water would have drained out to sea by low tide.\n\n==History==\nDuring the Second World War, Sungai Pelek was under the control of the Japanese. There was active local resistance to the Japanese occupation. Some British military personnel were trapped in Sungai Pelek by the advancing Japanese forces. These British soldiers were aided in their escape by Mr Lim Yee Ko and his friends.\n\nThe Communist insurgency during the 1950s, also known colloquially as \"[[Malayan Emergency|The Emergency]]\", saw the building of a chain-link fence around the village.
