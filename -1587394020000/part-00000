In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as ''masala chai'', '''''chai tea''''',<ref name=About/> or simply ''chai'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chai|title=Definition of CHAI|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref> even though the term refers to [[tea]] in general in the original language.

''Chai: the Spice Tea of India''. Pownal, Vermont: Storey, 1999.</ref> Some of the ''chai'' [[Spice mix|''masala'']] spice mixtures, or [[Karha (spices)|''karha'']] and ''[[Kashayam]]'' (Kha-shai-yam) that are still in current use, are derived from ancient [[Ayurvedic]] texts.\n\nIn the 1830s, the British [[East India Company]] became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around one pound (by weight) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in [[British Raj|British India]] (50%) and [[British Ceylon]] (33%), present-day Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caffeine, the most popular stimulant|page=[https://archive.org/details/caffeinemostpopu00gilbrich/page/24 24]|last=M.|first=Gilbert, Richard|date=1986|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=9780877547563|location=New York|oclc=12970317|url=https://archive.org/details/caffeinemostpopu00gilbrich/page/24}}</ref>\n\nHowever, consumption of [[black tea]] within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the (British-owned) [[Indian Tea Association]] in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent ''[[chaiwallah]]s'' throughout the growing railway system.\n\nThe official promotion of [[tea]] was as served in the English mode, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, ''masala chai'' in its present form has now firmly established itself as a popular beverage.<ref>Collingham, Lizzie. (2006). \"Chai: The Great Tea Campaign\". In ''Curry: A Tale of Cooks & Conquerors'', pp 187-214. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517241-8}}.</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\n[[File:Chai-Kwon-Do.jpg|thumb|Spices used for ''masala chai.]]\nThe [[recipe]] or preparation method for masala chai is not fixed, and many families have their own versions of the tea. Most ''chai ''contains caffeine, typically one-third that of coffee (if made with a black tea base). The tea leaves steep in the hot water long enough to extract intense flavour, ideally without releasing the bitter tannins. Because of the large range of possible variations, ''masala chai'' can be considered a class of tea rather than a specific kind. However, ''masala chai'' has five basic components which are almost always present: [[water]], [[Tea|tea leaves]], [[milk]], [[sugar]], and [[ginger]]. The [[western world|western]] adaption of chai, or chai latte, has a lighter and sweeter taste than the [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] version of a more [[herbal]] and [[spicy|spicier]] [[milk]] beverage.\n\n===Tea===\n{{see also|Indian tea culture|Pakistani tea culture}}\nThe base tea is usually a strong black tea such as [[Assam tea|Assam]], so the spices and sweeteners do not overpower it. Usually, a specific type of Assam is used called ''mamri''. [[Crush, tear, curl|Mamri tea]] has been cured in a special way that creates granules as opposed to \"leaf\" tea. It is inexpensive and the tea most often used in India. However, a wide variety of teas is used to make ''chai''. Most ''chai'' in India is brewed with strong black tea, but Kashmiri ''chai'' is brewed with [[gunpowder tea]].\n\n===Spices===\n[[File:Contents of a bag of chai tea.jpg|thumb|left|Spices and cut tea leaves.]]\nThe traditional ''masala chai'' is a spiced beverage brewed with different proportions of warming spices. The spice mixture, called '''karha''', uses a base of ground ginger and [[green cardamom]] pods. Other spices are usually added to this ''karha'' including one or more of [[cinnamon]], [[star anise]], [[fennel]] seeds, [[black pepper|peppercorn]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]] seeds, [[ginger root]], [[honey]], [[vanilla]], and other spices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hanumanchai.blogspot.ca/2011/11/karha-heart-of-chai.html |title=Karha: the Heart of Chai |publisher=Hanumanchai.blogspot.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-05-29}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sparklechai.com/what-is-chai/ What is Chai?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034327/http://www.sparklechai.com/what-is-chai/ |date=2015-04-30 }}</ref> In the Western world, using [[allspice]], to either replace or complement the cinnamon and clove, is also common.\n\nTraditionally, cardamom and ginger are the dominant notes, supplemented by other spices such as cloves, or black pepper; the latter two add a heat to the flavour and the utilization of cloves is more typical and popular throughout India. The traditional composition of spices often differs by [[climate]] and [[region]] in Southern and Southwestern Asia.\n\nFor example, in [[Western India]], cloves and black pepper are expressly avoided.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Kahwah|Kashmiri version]] of ''chai'' is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of flavourings: almonds, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and sometimes [[saffron]]. In [[Bhopal]], typically, a pinch of salt is added.\n\nOther possible ingredients include [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[black cardamom]], [[Chili pepper|chilli]], [[coriander]], [[rose]] flavouring (where rose petals are boiled along with the loose-leaf tea), or [[liquorice]] root. A small amount of [[cumin]] is also preferred by some people.\n\n===Milk===\n{{Main|milk}}\nTraditionally in [[India]], water buffalo milk is used to make'' chai''.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-l9GbAemUAEC&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The New Tea Book: A Guide to Black, Green, Herbal and Chai Teas |author=Sara Perry |publisher=Chronicle Books |date= 1 Aug 2001 |page=40|isbn=9780811830539 }}</ref> Outside of India, whole-fat cow's milk is usually used. Generally, ''masala chai'' is made by mixing one part milk with two to four parts water and heating the liquid to near boiling (or even full boiling). Some people like to use sweetened condensed milk in their ''masala chai'' to double as the sweetener. For those who prefer to drink ''chai'' without milk, the portion is replaced with water.\n\n===Sweetener===\n{{Main|Sweetener}}\nPlain white [[sucrose|sugar]], [[Demerara sugar]], other [[brown sugar]]s, [[Palm sugar|palm]] or [[Coconut sugar|coconut]] sugars, [[syrup]], or [[honey]] is used. [[Jaggery]] is also used as a sweetener, mostly in rural parts of India. While some prefer unsweetened ''chai'', some sugar enhances the flavour of the spices.\n\nSome recipes use up to three tablespoons of sugar in 3\u00bd cups of chai. Sugar is typically added to suit the drinker.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:teamaking.JPG|thumb|left|A boy in [[Mysore, India]] preparing'' masala chai'': As it is prepared by [[decoction]], preparation usually includes straining tea from the solids.]]\n\nThe simplest traditional method of preparing ''masala chai'' is through [[decoction]], by actively simmering or boiling a mixture of milk and water with loose-leaf tea, sweeteners, and whole spices. Indian markets all over the world sell various brands of ''chai masala'', (Hindi \u091a\u093e\u092f \u092e\u0938\u093e\u0932\u093e [''ch\u0101y mas\u0101l\u0101''], \"tea spice\") for this purpose, though many households or tea vendors, known in India as ''chai wallahs'',<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a chai wallah? |url=http://chaiwallahsofindia.com/2013/04/chai-wallah/|work=Chai Wallahs of India|accessdate=30 November 2013|date=2013-04-20}}</ref> blend their own. The solid tea and spice residues are strained off from ''masala chai ''before serving.\n\nThe method may vary according to taste or local custom; for example, some households may combine all of the ingredients at the start, bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately strain and serve; others may leave the mixture simmering for a longer time, or begin by bringing the tea leaves to a boil and only add the spices toward the end (or vice versa).\n\nA common [[Maharashtrians|Maharashtrian]] practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a \"tea masala\". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, \"tea masala\" typically consists of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tealiciousbeverages.com/5spicetea|title=Recipe for 5 Spice Tea {{!}} Tea|website=Tealicious|language=en|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaboard.gov.in/TEABOARDCSM/MTE=|title=Masala Tea|website=www.teaboard.gov.in|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> is added. The ''chai'' is immediately taken off the heat, covered, and allowed to sit for about 10 minutes to allow the black tea to infuse into the ''chai''. The ''chai'' is then strained and served.\n\n===Consumption of tea in the Indian subcontinent===\n[[File:A Kolkata voter - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|right|A man in [[Kolkata, India]], with a chaidaan for serving nine glasses of chai.]]\nMasala tea is a very popular beverage in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka). Small, roadside businesses called ''chai walla'', make and deliver tea to people's places of business in a ''chaidaan'', a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/india-design-objects/index.html | title=10 objects that define Indian design| date=2018-07-20}}</ref> In the metropolitan city of [[Mumbai]], roadside tea stalls serve smaller cups of tea at a lower budget which is referred to as 'Cutting Chai', the term 'Cutting' referring to 'Cut' the full cup into two parts to reduce the cost of the cup of tea. Circa 2020, the cost of a 'cutting' cup of tea varies between \u20b96 and \u20b910 - a full cup costing \u20b910 to \u20b920.\n\nMasala tea is a beverage that is consumed heavily across South Asian households.

Most American coffeehouse chains use commercial liquid concentrates instead of brewing their own ''chai'' from scratch. Dry powdered or granular mixes similar to [[instant coffee]] are also commercially available. Chatillon Chai is a tea concentrate blend originating from the Basque region in the 18th century.\n\nBoth dry instant mixes and liquid concentrates can be replicated at home. A liquid concentrate can be made by brewing an unusually concentrated pot of highly spiced tea, so that the dilution of a small amount into a cup of hot water or a glass of cold milk results in roughly the same concentration of tea as in a normally proportioned brew; e.g., to make a syrup from which one ounce suffices to make one eight-ounce cup of normal chai when diluted, brew tea (and the proportional quantity of spices) at eight times normal concentration.\n\nSimilarly, unsweetened iced-tea powder can be tailored to individual taste with powdered spices, sugar, and (if desired for convenience and texture) dry nonfat milk and dry [[non-dairy creamer]]; the result can be mixed with hot water to produce a form of instant ''chai masala''. This form of dry mix has certain disadvantages, however; the powdered spices may leave a grainy residue at the bottom of the cup, and it may dissolve poorly in cold water, especially in the presence of dry milk/creamer powders.\n\n===In Western cultures===\nMany Western supermarkets offer [[teabag]]s of ''chai'' which contain an assortment of ground ''chai'' spices and require steeping in hot water.\n\nSome American supermarkets also carry bottles of \"chai spice\" alongside their dried [[herb]]s and other [[spice]]s. Unlike Indian spice mixtures, the American ones are generally made from powdered spices ([[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]] tends to be the dominant flavour) and sometimes sugar; this mixture can be added last minute to an already-brewed cup of tea as straining off the solids is not needed.\n\n===Cold ''chai''===\nAs an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold \"''chai''\" beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple spiced [[iced tea]] without milk to a [[Slush (beverage)|slush]] of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a [[blender]] and topped with [[whipped cream]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages/chai-creme-frappuccino-blended-creme |title=Tazo\u00ae Chai Frappuccino\u00ae Blended Cr\u00e8me &#124; Starbucks Coffee Company |publisher=Starbucks.com |accessdate=2012-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805063842/http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages/chai-creme-frappuccino-blended-creme |archivedate=2012-08-05 }}</ref> <!-- sequestered for now: this seems like advertising: This latter combination is known as a ''chai [[frappuccino]]'' blended ''cr\u00e8me'' at [[Starbucks]] or a ''blended chai latte'' at [[It's a Grind Coffee House]] or other coffee houses. --> It is essentially different from the original version of a hot beverage.\n\n===Components===\nMany Western commercial preparations use nontraditional ingredients such as [[vanilla]] or [[chocolate]], relegating the traditional ''masala ''spices to a relatively minor role.\n\nNon-tea-based variants may be prepared with [[herbal tea]]s or with the South American beverage ''[[yerba mate]].\n\nSome coffeehouses in the United States offer a version of ''masala chai'' augmented with espresso, but this beverage does not have any one universally recognised name. It was invented accidentally in Covent Garden, England, by a nice lady making a chai latte for an American in the late 1990s. She poured in a shot of espresso by mistake, and he decided to try it rather than get her to make another. The American thought it delicious and for years he ordered it wherever he traveled. Depending on the establishment, it is now called a \"java chai\", \"red eye chai\", \u201cturbochaiger\u201d, \"chai charger\", \"tough guy chai\", the American\u2019s preferred \"dirty chai\", or many other different names besides.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/dirty-chai-definition-765697|title=What's a Dirty Chai?|work=The Spruce|access-date=2018-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete idiot's guide to coffee and tea|last=Travis.|first=Arndorfer|date=2006|publisher=Alpha Books|others=Hansen, Kristine.|page=120|isbn=9781440626012|location=New York|oclc=489450263}}</ref> However, despite the common use in many localities to use the term \"latte\" as an abbreviation of \"caffe latte\" (\"cafe latte\"), the term \"chai latte\" does not generally imply the presence of coffee in the beverage; see the discussion of the terminology above (literally, ''latte'' is Italian for \"milk\").\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|India|Drink}}\n* [[Chaiwala]]\n* [[Kulhar]]\n* [[Noon chai]]\n* [[List of Indian beverages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chai}}\n* [http://www.worldteanews.com/news/global-evolution-chai The Global Evolution of Chai]\n\n{{Teas}}\n{{Sri Lankan cuisine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Masala Chai}}\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Blended tea]]\n[[Category:Indian tea]]\n[[Category:Nepalese tea]]\n[[Category:Pakistani tea]]\n[[Category:Sri Lankan drinks]]\n[[Category:Tea culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Flavoured tea beverage made with aromatic spices and herbs}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name            = Masala chai\n| image           = [[File:Masala Chai.JPG|frameless|upright=1.1]]\n| caption         = Masala chai served with [[biscuits]]\n| alternate_name  = Spiced tea\n| country         = \n| region          = [[Indian subcontinent]]<ref name=SeattleWeekly>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/949624-129/chai-tea-spice-spicy-coffee-india|title=A Brief History of Chai and 5 to Try (or Retry) This Fall|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515143003/http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/949624-129/chai-tea-spice-spicy-coffee-india|archive-date=15 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=ChaiPilgrimage>{{cite web|url=http://chaipilgrimage.com/blogs/journal/8432269-origin-of-masala-chai|title=Origin of Masala Chai \u2013 Chai Pilgrimage|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=About>{{cite web|url=http://coffeetea.about.com/od/historyculture/a/MasalaChaiHistory.htm|title=The History of Masala Chai (a.k.a. \"Chai Tea\")|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n| creator         = \n| course          = \n| type            = [[Tea blending and additives|Flavoured]] [[tea]]\n| served          = \n| main_ingredient = [[Black tea]], [[milk]], [[spice]]s, [[sugar]] (optional)\n\n| calories        = \n| other           =  \n}}\n'''Masala chai''' ({{IPAc-en|t\u0283|a\u026a|}}; {{lit}} \"mixed-spice tea\") is a [[Tea blending and additives|flavoured tea]] [[beverage]] made by brewing [[black tea]] with a mixture of aromatic [[List of Indian spices|Indian spices]] and [[herb]]s.

''Chai: the Spice Tea of India''. Pownal, Vermont: Storey, 1999.</ref> Some of the ''chai'' [[Spice mix|''masala'']] spice mixtures, or [[Karha (spices)|''karha'']] and ''[[Kashayam]]'' (Kha-shai-yam) that are still in current use, are derived from ancient [[Ayurvedic]] texts.\n\nIn the 1830s, the British [[East India Company]] became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around one pound (by weight) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in [[British Raj|British India]] (50%) and [[British Ceylon]] (33%), present-day Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caffeine, the most popular stimulant|page=[https://archive.org/details/caffeinemostpopu00gilbrich/page/24 24]|last=M.|first=Gilbert, Richard|date=1986|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=9780877547563|location=New York|oclc=12970317|url=https://archive.org/details/caffeinemostpopu00gilbrich/page/24}}</ref>\n\nHowever, consumption of [[black tea]] within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the (British-owned) [[Indian Tea Association]] in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent ''[[chaiwallah]]s'' throughout the growing railway system.\n\nThe official promotion of [[tea]] was as served in the English mode, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, ''masala chai'' in its present form has now firmly established itself as a popular beverage.<ref>Collingham, Lizzie. (2006). \"Chai: The Great Tea Campaign\". In ''Curry: A Tale of Cooks & Conquerors'', pp 187-214. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517241-8}}.</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\n[[File:Chai-Kwon-Do.jpg|thumb|Spices used for ''masala chai.]]\nThe [[recipe]] or preparation method for masala chai is not fixed, and many families have their own versions of the tea. Most ''chai ''contains caffeine, typically one-third that of coffee (if made with a black tea base). The tea leaves steep in the hot water long enough to extract intense flavour, ideally without releasing the bitter tannins. Because of the large range of possible variations, ''masala chai'' can be considered a class of tea rather than a specific kind. However, ''masala chai'' has six basic components which are almost always present: [[water]], [[Tea|tea leaves]], [[milk]], [[sugar]], [[cardamom]], and [[ginger]]. The [[western world|western]] adaption of chai, or chai latte, has a lighter and sweeter taste than the [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] version of a more [[herbal]] and [[spicy|spicier]] [[milk]] beverage.\n\n===Tea===\n{{see also|Indian tea culture|Pakistani tea culture}}\nThe base tea is usually a strong black tea such as [[Assam tea|Assam]], so the spices and sweeteners do not overpower it. Usually, a specific type of Assam is used called ''mamri''. [[Crush, tear, curl|Mamri tea]] has been cured in a special way that creates granules as opposed to \"leaf\" tea. It is inexpensive and the tea most often used in India. However, a wide variety of teas is used to make ''chai''. Most ''chai'' in India is brewed with strong black tea, but Kashmiri ''chai'' is brewed with [[gunpowder tea]].\n\n===Spices===\n[[File:Contents of a bag of chai tea.jpg|thumb|left|Spices and cut tea leaves.]]\nThe traditional ''masala chai'' is a spiced beverage brewed with different proportions of warming spices. The spice mixture, called '''karha''', uses a base of ground ginger and [[green cardamom]] pods. Other spices are usually added to this ''karha'' including one or more of [[cinnamon]], [[star anise]], [[fennel]] seeds, [[black pepper|peppercorn]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]] seeds, [[ginger root]], [[honey]], [[vanilla]], and other spices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hanumanchai.blogspot.ca/2011/11/karha-heart-of-chai.html |title=Karha: the Heart of Chai |publisher=Hanumanchai.blogspot.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-05-29}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sparklechai.com/what-is-chai/ What is Chai?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034327/http://www.sparklechai.com/what-is-chai/ |date=2015-04-30 }}</ref> In the Western world, using [[allspice]], to either replace or complement the cinnamon and clove, is also common.\n\nTraditionally, cardamom and ginger are the dominant notes, supplemented by other spices such as cloves, or black pepper; the latter two add a heat to the flavour and the utilization of cloves is more typical and popular throughout India. The traditional composition of spices often differs by [[climate]] and [[region]] in Southern and Southwestern Asia.\n\nFor example, in [[Western India]], cloves and black pepper are expressly avoided.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Kahwah|Kashmiri version]] of ''chai'' is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of flavourings: almonds, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and sometimes [[saffron]]. In [[Bhopal]], typically, a pinch of salt is added.\n\nOther possible ingredients include [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[black cardamom]], [[Chili pepper|chilli]], [[coriander]], [[rose]] flavouring (where rose petals are boiled along with the loose-leaf tea), or [[liquorice]] root. A small amount of [[cumin]] is also preferred by some people.\n\n===Milk===\n{{Main|milk}}\nTraditionally in [[India]], water buffalo milk is used to make'' chai''.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-l9GbAemUAEC&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The New Tea Book: A Guide to Black, Green, Herbal and Chai Teas |author=Sara Perry |publisher=Chronicle Books |date= 1 Aug 2001 |page=40|isbn=9780811830539 }}</ref> Outside of India, whole-fat cow's milk is usually used. Generally, ''masala chai'' is made by mixing one part milk with two to four parts water and heating the liquid to near boiling (or even full boiling). Some people like to use sweetened condensed milk in their ''masala chai'' to double as the sweetener. For those who prefer to drink ''chai'' without milk, the portion is replaced with water.\n\n===Sweetener===\n{{Main|Sweetener}}\nPlain white [[sucrose|sugar]], [[Demerara sugar]], other [[brown sugar]]s, [[Palm sugar|palm]] or [[Coconut sugar|coconut]] sugars, [[syrup]], or [[honey]] is used. [[Jaggery]] is also used as a sweetener, mostly in rural parts of India. While some prefer unsweetened ''chai'', some sugar enhances the flavour of the spices.\n\nSome recipes use up to three tablespoons of sugar in 3\u00bd cups of chai. Sugar is typically added to suit the drinker.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:teamaking.JPG|thumb|left|A boy in [[Mysore, India]] preparing'' masala chai'': As it is prepared by [[decoction]], preparation usually includes straining tea from the solids.]]\n\nThe simplest traditional method of preparing ''masala chai'' is through [[decoction]], by actively simmering or boiling a mixture of milk and water with loose-leaf tea, sweeteners, and whole spices. Indian markets all over the world sell various brands of ''chai masala'', (Hindi \u091a\u093e\u092f \u092e\u0938\u093e\u0932\u093e [''ch\u0101y mas\u0101l\u0101''], \"tea spice\") for this purpose, though many households or tea vendors, known in India as ''chai wallahs'',<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a chai wallah? |url=http://chaiwallahsofindia.com/2013/04/chai-wallah/|work=Chai Wallahs of India|accessdate=30 November 2013|date=2013-04-20}}</ref> blend their own. The solid tea and spice residues are strained off from ''masala chai ''before serving.\n\nThe method may vary according to taste or local custom; for example, some households may combine all of the ingredients at the start, bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately strain and serve; others may leave the mixture simmering for a longer time, or begin by bringing the tea leaves to a boil and only add the spices toward the end (or vice versa).\n\nA common [[Maharashtrians|Maharashtrian]] practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a \"tea masala\". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, \"tea masala\" typically consists of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tealiciousbeverages.com/5spicetea|title=Recipe for 5 Spice Tea {{!}} Tea|website=Tealicious|language=en|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaboard.gov.in/TEABOARDCSM/MTE=|title=Masala Tea|website=www.teaboard.gov.in|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> is added. The ''chai'' is immediately taken off the heat, covered, and allowed to sit for about 10 minutes to allow the black tea to infuse into the ''chai''. The ''chai'' is then strained and served.\n\n===Consumption of tea in the Indian subcontinent===\n[[File:A Kolkata voter - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|right|A man in [[Kolkata, India]], with a chaidaan for serving nine glasses of chai.]]\nMasala tea is a very popular beverage in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka).

Circa 2020, the cost of a 'cutting' cup of tea varies between \u20b96 and \u20b910 - a full cup costing \u20b910 to \u20b920.\n\nMasala tea is a beverage that is consumed heavily across South Asian households. While most people like to consume it in the morning along with breakfast, it is also offered to any guests that visit.\n\nWith the demand increasing many startups in India have taken tea stalls as a good business opportunity.

These range in complexity from a simple spiced [[iced tea]] without milk to a [[Slush (beverage)|slush]] of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a [[blender]] and topped with [[whipped cream]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages/chai-creme-frappuccino-blended-creme |title=Tazo\u00ae Chai Frappuccino\u00ae Blended Cr\u00e8me &#124; Starbucks Coffee Company |publisher=Starbucks.com |accessdate=2012-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805063842/http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages/chai-creme-frappuccino-blended-creme |archivedate=2012-08-05 }}</ref> <!-- sequestered for now: this seems like advertising: This latter combination is known as a ''chai [[frappuccino]]'' blended ''cr\u00e8me'' at [[Starbucks]] or a ''blended chai latte'' at [[It's a Grind Coffee House]] or other coffee houses. --> It is essentially different from the original version of a hot beverage.\n\n===Components===\nMany Western commercial preparations use nontraditional ingredients such as [[vanilla]] or [[chocolate]], relegating the traditional ''masala ''spices to a relatively minor role.\n\nNon-tea-based variants may be prepared with [[herbal tea]]s or with the South American beverage ''[[yerba mate]].\n\nSome coffeehouses in the United States offer a version of ''masala chai'' augmented with espresso, but this beverage does not have any one universally recognised name. It was invented accidentally in Covent Garden, England, by a nice lady making a chai latte for an American in the late 1990s. She poured in a shot of espresso by mistake, and he decided to try it rather than get her to make another. The American thought it delicious and for years he ordered it wherever he traveled. Depending on the establishment, it is now called a \"java chai\", \"red eye chai\", \u201cturbochaiger\u201d, \"chai charger\", \"tough guy chai\", the American\u2019s preferred \"dirty chai\", or many other different names besides.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/dirty-chai-definition-765697|title=What's a Dirty Chai?|work=The Spruce|access-date=2018-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete idiot's guide to coffee and tea|last=Travis.|first=Arndorfer|date=2006|publisher=Alpha Books|others=Hansen, Kristine.|page=120|isbn=9781440626012|location=New York|oclc=489450263}}</ref> However, despite the common use in many localities to use the term \"latte\" as an abbreviation of \"caffe latte\" (\"cafe latte\"), the term \"chai latte\" does not generally imply the presence of coffee in the beverage; see the discussion of the terminology above (literally, ''latte'' is Italian for \"milk\").\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|India|Drink}}\n* [[Chaiwala]]\n* [[Kulhar]]\n* [[Noon chai]]\n* [[List of Indian beverages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chai}}\n* [http://www.worldteanews.com/news/global-evolution-chai The Global Evolution of Chai]\n\n{{Teas}}\n{{Sri Lankan cuisine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Masala Chai}}\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Blended tea]]\n[[Category:Indian tea]]\n[[Category:Nepalese tea]]\n[[Category:Pakistani tea]]\n[[Category:Sri Lankan drinks]]\n[[Category:Tea culture]]\n", "name_user": "NikRich29", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIngredients", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai"}
