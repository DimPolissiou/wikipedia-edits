When defeated, Koopas may flee from or retreat inside their [[Turtle shell|shells]], which can usually be used as weapons. Koopa shells are a recurring weapon in the series, particularly popularized in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, in which they can be fired as [[projectiles]] against other racers.

Series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] had a fellow designer draw the enemy, but the result was far too realistic to fit in with the tone of the game, so Miyamoto designed the enemy himself. While the design had quite a large head, Miyamoto validated it by suggesting it looked like a [[tortoise]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In ''Mario Bros.'', Shellcreepers could only be defeated by hitting the platform on which they were stood from underneath, thus flipping them on their backs allowing [[Mario]] or [[Luigi]] to kick them off the screen.\n\nIn ''Mario Bros.'', the color of a Shellcreeper's shell indicated how fast it was - green being the slowest, purple being faster, and red being the fastest.

In ''Super Mario Bros.'', green-shelled Koopas wander aimlessly along platforms and even fall into pits, whereas those with red shells patrol their platforms, turning around when they reach the edge of it. ''Super Mario Bros.'' also introduced the Koopa Paratroopa (\"Patapata\" in Japan), a Koopa Troopa with wings which jumps up and down or flies, thus making it harder to dodge and defeat. The design of the Paratroopa came from ''Mario'' developer [[Takashi Tezuka]] in an attempt to add a flying character to ''Super Mario Bros.'', but there was not enough space to include such a character. Tezuka suggested that they put wings on the Koopa Troopa, which Miyamoto did not think would work.
