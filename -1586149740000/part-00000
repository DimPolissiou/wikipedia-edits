Pictured here is a cross-section showing the [[gross anatomy]] of the [[human brain]]]]\n'''[[User:Superstar Harshit|Neuroanatomy]]''' is the study of the structure and organization of the [[nervous system]]. In contrast to animals with [[radial symmetry]], whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with [[bilateral symmetry]] have segregated, defined nervous systems. Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood. In [[vertebrate]]s, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] (together called the [[central nervous system]], or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the [[peripheral nervous system]], or PNS). The delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or \"lesions\" to specific brain areas affects [[behavior]] or other neural functions.\n\nFor information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see [[nervous system]]. For information about the typical structure of the Homo sapiens nervous system, see [[human brain]] or [[peripheral nervous system]]. This article discusses information pertinent to the ''study'' of neuroanatomy.\n\n== History ==\n[[image:Bourgery Neuroanatomie.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[J. M.

Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria were perhaps the most influential Greek neuroscientists with their studies involving dissecting brains.<ref name = RF/> For several hundred years afterward, with the cultural taboo of dissection, no major progress occurred in neuroscience. However, Pope Sixtus IV effectively revitalized the study of neuroanatomy by altering the papal policy and allowing human dissection. This resulted in a boom of research in neuroanatomy by artists and scientists of the Renaissance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginn | first1 = S.

Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the [[list of distinct cell types in the adult human body]]). Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters which generally act across [[synapse]]s (close contacts between two neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle cell; note also extrasynaptic effects are possible, as well as release of neurotransmitters into the neural extracellular space), and produce our memories, thoughts and movements. Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce [[myelin|myelin (oligodendrocytes)]], and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons. Some glial cells ([[astrocytes]]) can even propagate intercellular [[Astrocyte#Calcium waves|calcium waves]] over long distances in response to stimulation, and release [[gliotransmitter]]s in response to changes in calcium concentration. Wound scars in the brain largely contain astrocytes. The [[extracellular matrix]] also provides support on the molecular level for the brain's cells, vehiculating substances to and from the blood vessels.\n\nAt the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]] in mammals or the [[mushroom bodies]] of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].<ref>[http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html Mushroom Bodies of the Fruit Fly] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716000325/http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html |date=2012-07-16 }}</ref> These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general systemic pathways of the nervous system. For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories in connection with many other cerebral regions. The peripheral nervous system also contains afferent or efferent [[nerves]], which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, or from sensory or motor sorts of peripheral ganglia, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body. Nerves are made primarily of the [[axons]] or dendrites of neurons (axons in case of efferent motor fibres, and dendrites in case of afferent sensory fibres of the nerves), along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into [[nerve fascicle]]s.\n\nThe vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The [[central nervous system]] (CNS) consists of the [[human brain|brain]], [[retina]], and [[spinal cord]], while the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) is made up of all the nerves and ganglia (packets of peripheral neurons) outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The [[somatic nervous system]] is made up of \"afferent\" neurons, which bring sensory information from the somatic (body) sense organs to the CNS, and \"efferent\" neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the voluntary muscles of the body. The [[autonomic nervous system]] can work with or without the control of the CNS (that's why it's called 'autonomous'), and also has two subdivisions, called [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]], which are important for transmitting motor orders to the body's basic internal organs, thus controlling functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, unlike somatic nerves, contain only efferent fibers. Sensory signals coming from the viscera course into the CNS through the somatic sensory nerves (e.g., visceral pain), or through some particular cranial nerves (e.g., chemosensitive or mechanic signals).\n\n=== Orientation in neuroanatomy ===\n[[Image:Parasagittal MRI of human head in patient with benign familial macrocephaly prior to brain injury (ANIMATED).gif|thumb|left|Para-sagittal [[MRI]] of the head in a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]].]]\nIn anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see [[Anatomical terms of location]]). The axis of the CNS is often wrongly assumed to be more or less straight, but it actually shows always two ventral flexures (cervical and cephalic flexures) and a dorsal flexure (pontine flexure), all due to differential growth during embryogenesis. The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are:\n\n* Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely refers to the top or upper side, represented by the roof plate of the brain, and ventral to the bottom or lower side, represented by the floor plate. These descriptors originally were used for ''dorsum'' and ''ventrum'' \u2013 back and belly \u2013 of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior. The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral \u2013 i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above \u2013 whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault. Reference to the roof and floor plates of the brain is less prone to confusion, also allow us to keep an eye on the axial flexures mentioned above. Dorsal and ventral are thus relative terms in the brain, whose exact meaning depends on the specific location.\n* Rostral and caudal: ''rostral'' refers in general anatomy to the front of the body (towards the nose, or ''rostrum'' in Latin), and ''caudal'' refers to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; ''cauda'' in Latin). The rostrocaudal dimension of the brain corresponds to its length axis, which runs across the cited flexures from the caudal tip of the spinal cord into a rostral end roughly at the optic chiasma. In the erect Man, the directional terms \"superior\" and \"inferior\" essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body and brain axes are roughly  oriented vertically in the erect position. However, all vertebrates develop a very marked ventral kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the [[cephalic flexure]]. The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 180 degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the [[forebrain]] (axis ending rostrally at the optic chiasma) and the [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]] (axis roughly vertical, but including additional minor kinks at the pontine and cervical flexures) These flexural changes in axial dimension are problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain. There is abundant literature that wrongly disregards the axial flexures and assumes a relatively straight brain axis.\n* Medial and lateral: ''medial'' refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor ''median'' means a position precisely at the midline). ''Lateral'' is the opposite (a position more or less separated away from the midline).\nNote that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).\n\nCommonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are \"sagittal\", \"transverse\" or \"coronal\", and \"axial\" or \"horizontal\". Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis. Due to the axial brain flexures, no section plane ever achieves a complete section series in a selected plane, because some sections inevitably result cut oblique or even perpendicular to it, as they pass through the flexures. Experience allows to discern the portions that result cut as desired.\n\n* A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections in general are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension (see the image above). The term ''sagittal'' refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (''sagitta''; arrow in Latin).\n* A section plane orthogonal to the axis of any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse (e.g., a transverse section of a finger or of the vertebral column); if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, that represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis \u2013 that of the primordial elongated neural tube \u2013 which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the chiasmatic hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes much erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely ''coronal'' sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis. In any case, the concept of 'coronal' sections is less precise than that of 'transverse', since often coronal section planes are used which are not truly orthogonal to the rostral end of the brain axis. The term is etymologically related to the ''coronal suture'' of the craneum and this to the position where crowns are worn (Latin ''corona'' means crown). It is not clear what sort of crown was meant originally (maybe just a diadema), and this leads unfortunately to ambiguity in the section plane defined merely as coronal.\n* A coronal plane across the human head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the plane in which a king's crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the ''coronal suture'' of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face). Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.\n* Horizontal sections by definition are aligned (parallel) with the horizon. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts. Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections, and in theory are parallel to the length axis. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).\n\nAccording to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.\n\n== Tools ==\nModern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform [[research]]. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available. Many of the [[histological]] techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well. However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.\n\n=== Cell staining ===\nIn biological systems, [[staining]] is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.\n\n[[Nissl staining]] uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]], which is abundant in neurons. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system [[cytoarchitecture]].\n\nThe classic [[Golgi stain]] uses [[potassium dichromate]] and [[silver nitrate]] to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -[[dendrites]], [[axon]]- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.\n\n=== Histochemistry ===\n[[Histochemistry]] uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes. This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.\n\n[[Immunocytochemistry]] is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein. This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]) in various regions of the nervous system.\n\n[[In situ hybridization]] uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.\n\n=== Genetically encoded markers ===\nBy expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called \"[[brainbow]]\" mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons. This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with [[fluorescence microscopy]], enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.\n\n[[Optogenetics]] uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.\n\n=== Non-invasive brain imaging ===\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] has been used extensively to investigate brain [[Diffusion tensor imaging|structure]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|function]] non-invasively in healthy human subjects. An important example is [[diffusion tensor imaging]], which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.\n\n=== Viral-based methods ===\nCertain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses. So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginger | first1 = M. | last2 = Haberl | first2 = M. | last3 = Conzelmann | first3 = K.-K. | last4 = Schwarz | first4 = M. | last5 = Frick | first5 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Revealing the secrets of neuronal circuits with recombinant rabies virus technology | url = | journal = Front.

These molecules are selectively transported [[anterograde tracing|anterogradely]] (from soma to axon terminals) or [[retrograde tracing|retrogradely]] (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.\n\n=== Connectomics ===\n{{Main|Connectomics}}\nSerial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems.

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system. For example, the ''C. elegans'' nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next. This has allowed researchers using [[electron microscopy]] to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species. The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast).\n\n=== Caenorhabditis elegans ===\n[[Image:Bilaterian-plan.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A rod-shaped body contains a digestive system running from the mouth at one end to the anus at the other.

In contrast to animals with [[radial symmetry]], whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with [[bilateral symmetry]] have segregated, defined nervous systems. Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood. In [[vertebrate]]s, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] (together called the [[central nervous system]], or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the [[peripheral nervous system]], or PNS). The delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or \"lesions\" to specific brain areas affects [[behavior]] or other neural functions.\n\nFor information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see [[nervous system]].

Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the [[list of distinct cell types in the adult human body]]). Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters which generally act across [[synapse]]s (close contacts between two neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle cell; note also extrasynaptic effects are possible, as well as release of neurotransmitters into the neural extracellular space), and produce our memories, thoughts and movements. Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce [[myelin|myelin (oligodendrocytes)]], and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons. Some glial cells ([[astrocytes]]) can even propagate intercellular [[Astrocyte#Calcium waves|calcium waves]] over long distances in response to stimulation, and release [[gliotransmitter]]s in response to changes in calcium concentration. Wound scars in the brain largely contain astrocytes. The [[extracellular matrix]] also provides support on the molecular level for the brain's cells, vehiculating substances to and from the blood vessels.\n\nAt the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]] in mammals or the [[mushroom bodies]] of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].<ref>[http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html Mushroom Bodies of the Fruit Fly] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716000325/http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html |date=2012-07-16 }}</ref> These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general systemic pathways of the nervous system. For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories in connection with many other cerebral regions. The peripheral nervous system also contains afferent or efferent [[nerves]], which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, or from sensory or motor sorts of peripheral ganglia, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body. Nerves are made primarily of the [[axons]] or dendrites of neurons (axons in case of efferent motor fibres, and dendrites in case of afferent sensory fibres of the nerves), along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into [[nerve fascicle]]s.\n\nThe vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The [[central nervous system]] (CNS) consists of the [[human brain|brain]], [[retina]], and [[spinal cord]], while the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) is made up of all the nerves and ganglia (packets of peripheral neurons) outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The [[somatic nervous system]] is made up of \"afferent\" neurons, which bring sensory information from the somatic (body) sense organs to the CNS, and \"efferent\" neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the voluntary muscles of the body. The [[autonomic nervous system]] can work with or without the control of the CNS (that's why it's called 'autonomous'), and also has two subdivisions, called [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]], which are important for transmitting motor orders to the body's basic internal organs, thus controlling functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, unlike somatic nerves, contain only efferent fibers. Sensory signals coming from the viscera course into the CNS through the somatic sensory nerves (e.g., visceral pain), or through some particular cranial nerves (e.g., chemosensitive or mechanic signals).\n\n=== Orientation in neuroanatomy ===\n[[Image:Parasagittal MRI of human head in patient with benign familial macrocephaly prior to brain injury (ANIMATED).gif|thumb|left|Para-sagittal [[MRI]] of the head in a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]].]]\nIn anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see [[Anatomical terms of location]]). The axis of the CNS is often wrongly assumed to be more or less straight, but it actually shows always two ventral flexures (cervical and cephalic flexures) and a dorsal flexure (pontine flexure), all due to differential growth during embryogenesis. The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are:\n\n* Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely refers to the top or upper side, represented by the roof plate of the brain, and ventral to the bottom or lower side, represented by the floor plate. These descriptors originally were used for ''dorsum'' and ''ventrum'' \u2013 back and belly \u2013 of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior. The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral \u2013 i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above \u2013 whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault. Reference to the roof and floor plates of the brain is less prone to confusion, also allow us to keep an eye on the axial flexures mentioned above. Dorsal and ventral are thus relative terms in the brain, whose exact meaning depends on the specific location.\n* Rostral and caudal: ''rostral'' refers in general anatomy to the front of the body (towards the nose, or ''rostrum'' in Latin), and ''caudal'' refers to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; ''cauda'' in Latin). The rostrocaudal dimension of the brain corresponds to its length axis, which runs across the cited flexures from the caudal tip of the spinal cord into a rostral end roughly at the optic chiasma. In the erect Man, the directional terms \"superior\" and \"inferior\" essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body and brain axes are roughly  oriented vertically in the erect position. However, all vertebrates develop a very marked ventral kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the [[cephalic flexure]]. The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 180 degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the [[forebrain]] (axis ending rostrally at the optic chiasma) and the [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]] (axis roughly vertical, but including additional minor kinks at the pontine and cervical flexures) These flexural changes in axial dimension are problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain. There is abundant literature that wrongly disregards the axial flexures and assumes a relatively straight brain axis.\n* Medial and lateral: ''medial'' refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor ''median'' means a position precisely at the midline). ''Lateral'' is the opposite (a position more or less separated away from the midline).\nNote that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).\n\nCommonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are \"sagittal\", \"transverse\" or \"coronal\", and \"axial\" or \"horizontal\". Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis. Due to the axial brain flexures, no section plane ever achieves a complete section series in a selected plane, because some sections inevitably result cut oblique or even perpendicular to it, as they pass through the flexures. Experience allows to discern the portions that result cut as desired.\n\n* A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections in general are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension (see the image above). The term ''sagittal'' refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (''sagitta''; arrow in Latin).\n* A section plane orthogonal to the axis of any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse (e.g., a transverse section of a finger or of the vertebral column); if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, that represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis \u2013 that of the primordial elongated neural tube \u2013 which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the chiasmatic hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes much erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely ''coronal'' sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis. In any case, the concept of 'coronal' sections is less precise than that of 'transverse', since often coronal section planes are used which are not truly orthogonal to the rostral end of the brain axis. The term is etymologically related to the ''coronal suture'' of the craneum and this to the position where crowns are worn (Latin ''corona'' means crown). It is not clear what sort of crown was meant originally (maybe just a diadema), and this leads unfortunately to ambiguity in the section plane defined merely as coronal.\n* A coronal plane across the human head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the plane in which a king's crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the ''coronal suture'' of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face). Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.\n* Horizontal sections by definition are aligned (parallel) with the horizon. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts. Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections, and in theory are parallel to the length axis. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).\n\nAccording to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.\n\n== Tools ==\nModern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform [[research]]. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available. Many of the [[histological]] techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well. However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.\n\n=== Cell staining ===\nIn biological systems, [[staining]] is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.\n\n[[Nissl staining]] uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]], which is abundant in neurons. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system [[cytoarchitecture]].\n\nThe classic [[Golgi stain]] uses [[potassium dichromate]] and [[silver nitrate]] to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -[[dendrites]], [[axon]]- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.\n\n=== Histochemistry ===\n[[Histochemistry]] uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes. This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.\n\n[[Immunocytochemistry]] is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein. This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]) in various regions of the nervous system.\n\n[[In situ hybridization]] uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.\n\n=== Genetically encoded markers ===\nBy expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called \"[[brainbow]]\" mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons. This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with [[fluorescence microscopy]], enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.\n\n[[Optogenetics]] uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.\n\n=== Non-invasive brain imaging ===\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] has been used extensively to investigate brain [[Diffusion tensor imaging|structure]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|function]] non-invasively in healthy human subjects. An important example is [[diffusion tensor imaging]], which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.\n\n=== Viral-based methods ===\nCertain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses. So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginger | first1 = M. | last2 = Haberl | first2 = M. | last3 = Conzelmann | first3 = K.-K. | last4 = Schwarz | first4 = M. | last5 = Frick | first5 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Revealing the secrets of neuronal circuits with recombinant rabies virus technology | url = | journal = Front.

These molecules are selectively transported [[anterograde tracing|anterogradely]] (from soma to axon terminals) or [[retrograde tracing|retrogradely]] (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.\n\n=== Connectomics ===\n{{Main|Connectomics}}\nSerial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems.

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system. For example, the ''C. elegans'' nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next. This has allowed researchers using [[electron microscopy]] to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species. The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast).\n\n=== Caenorhabditis elegans ===\n[[Image:Bilaterian-plan.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A rod-shaped body contains a digestive system running from the mouth at one end to the anus at the other.

This would thus negate [[Germany|German]] criticisms that France was \"the [[Exploitation of labour|exploiter]] of colonial societies [and] the agent of [[miscegenation]] and [[decadence]]\".

French authorities published over 3,000 reports during the six-month period and held over 100 congresses. The exposition served as a vehicle for colonial writers to publicise their works, and it created a market in Paris for various ethnic cuisines, particularly [[cuisine of North Africa|North African]] and [[cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese]]. Filmmakers chose French colonies as the subjects of their works. The [[Permanent Colonial Museum]] (today the Cit\u00e9 nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration) opened at the end of the exposition.

The election was the third consecutive general election victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and second landslide under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who became the first Prime Minister since the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]] in [[1820 United Kingdom general election|1820]] to lead a party into three successive electoral victories.\n\nThe Conservatives ran a campaign focusing on lower taxes, a strong economy and strong defence. They also emphasised that unemployment had fallen below the 3&nbsp;million mark for the first time since 1981, and inflation was standing at 4%, its lowest level for some twenty years. The tabloid media also had strong support for the Conservative Party, particularly ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which ran anti-Labour articles with headlines such as \"Why I'm backing Kinnock, by [[Stalin]]\".\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Neil Kinnock]], was slowly moving towards a more [[centrism|centrist]] policy platform. The main aim of the Labour Party was simply to re-establish itself as the main progressive [[centre-left]] alternative to the Conservatives, after the rise of the [[Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) forced Labour onto the defensive. Indeed, the Labour Party succeeded in doing so at this general election. The [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] between the SDP and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was renewed but co-leaders [[David Owen]] and [[David Steel]] could not agree whether to support either major party in the event of a [[hung parliament]].\n\nThe Conservatives were returned to government, having suffered a net loss of only 21 seats, leaving them with 376 MPs and a second landslide majority of 102. Labour succeeded in resisting the challenge by the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance to become the main opposition. Moreover, Labour managed to increase its vote share in Scotland, Wales and the North of England. Yet Labour still returned only 229 MPs to Westminster, and in certain London constituencies which Labour had held before the election, the Conservatives actually made gains.\n\nThe election was a disappointment for the Alliance, who saw its vote share fall and suffered a net loss of one seat as well as former SDP leader [[Roy Jenkins]] losing his seat. This led to the two parties eventually merging completely to become the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. In Northern Ireland, the main unionist parties maintained their alliance in opposition to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], however the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionists]] lost two seats to the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]].\n\nThe 1987 election was the last in which the Conservatives won the popular vote in a general election by more than 10 points until the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]], and the last time they would hold more than 336 seats in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] until the 58th Parliament following the 2019 election. The 49th Parliament is the last time a Conservative government has lasted a full term with an overall majority of seats in Parliament.\n\nThe election night was covered live on the BBC and presented by [[David Dimbleby]], [[Peter Snow]] and [[Sir Robin Day]].<ref>{{YouTube |id=wTPxE8oC0bI |title=BBC Election 1987 coverage}}</ref> It was also broadcast on ITV and presented by [[Sir Alastair Burnet]], [[Peter Sissons]] and [[Alastair Stewart]].\n\nThe 1987 general election saw the election of the first [[Afro-Caribbean]] members of Parliament: [[Diane Abbott]], [[Paul Boateng]] and [[Bernie Grant]].  MPs leaving the House of Commons as a result of this election included former Labour Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]], [[Keith Joseph, Baron Joseph|Keith Joseph]], [[James Prior, Baron Prior|James Prior]], [[Ian Mikardo]], [[Roy Jenkins]], former Health Minister [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Clement Freud]].\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1979|1983|1987|1992|1997}}\n\n==Campaign and policies==\nThe Conservatives' campaign emphasised lower taxes, a strong economy and defence, and also employed rapid-response reactions to take advantage of Labour errors.  [[Norman Tebbit]] and [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] spearheaded the Conservative campaign. However, when on \"Wobbly Thursday\" it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a 2% Conservative lead, the \"exiles\" camp of [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]], [[Timothy Bell, Baron Bell|Tim Bell]] and the [[Young & Rubicam]] firm advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young's memoirs, Young got Tebbit by the lapels and shook him, shouting: \"Norman, listen to me, we're about to lose this fucking election.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2003|p=522}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/03/has-gordon-brown-delivered-his-last-budget-the-truth-is-that-blair-hasnt-yet-decided |title=Has Gordon Brown delivered his last Budget?

The first Conservative [[party political broadcast]] played on the theme of \"Freedom\" and ended with a fluttering Union Jack, the hymn ''[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]'' (which Thatcher would later quote in her \"[[Sermon on the Mound]]\") and the slogan \"It's Great To Be Great Again\".\n\nThe Labour campaign was a marked change from previous efforts; professionally directed by [[Peter Mandelson]] and [[Bryan Gould]], it concentrated on presenting and improving [[Neil Kinnock]]'s image to the electorate. Labour's first party political broadcast, dubbed ''Kinnock: The Movie'', was directed by [[Hugh Hudson]] of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' fame, and concentrated on portraying Kinnock as a caring, compassionate family man. It was filmed at the Great Orme in Wales and had \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" as its music.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pr1b5 |work=The 80s with Dominic Sandbrook |title=World in Motion |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> He was particularly critical of the high unemployment that the government's economic policies had resulted in, as well as condemning the wait for treatment that many patients had endured on the [[National Health Service]]. Kinnock's personal popularity jumped 16 points overnight after the initial broadcast.{{sfn|Butler|Kavanagh|1988|p=154}}\n\nOn 24 May, Kinnock was interviewed by [[David Frost]] and claimed that Labour's alternative defence strategy in the event of a Soviet attack would be \"using the resources you've got to make any occupation totally untenable\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In a speech two days later Thatcher attacked Labour's defence policy as a programme for \"defeat, surrender, occupation, and finally, prolonged guerrilla fighting&nbsp;...

The BBC announced the result at 02:35. Increasing [[Polarization (politics)|polarisation]] marked divisions across the country; the Conservatives dominated [[Southern England]] and took additional seats from Labour in London and the rest of the South, but performed less well in [[Northern England]], Scotland and Wales, losing many of the seats they had won there in previous elections. Yet the overall result of this election proved that the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]] retained significant support, with the Conservatives given a third convincing majority.\n\nDespite initial optimism and the professional campaign run by [[Neil Kinnock]], the election brought only twenty additional seats for Labour from the 1983 Conservative landslide. In many southern areas, the Labour vote actually fell, with the party losing seats in London. However, it represented a decisive victory against the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance and marked out the Labour Party as the main opposition to the Conservative Party. This was in stark contrast to 1983, when the Alliance almost matched Labour in terms of votes\u2014although Labour had almost 10 times as many seats as the Alliance.\n\nThe result for the Alliance was a disappointment, in that they had hoped to overtake Labour as the second party in the UK in terms of vote share. Instead, they lost one net seat and saw their vote share drop by almost 3%, with a widening gap of 8% between them and the Labour Party (compared to a 2% gap four years before). These results would eventually lead to the end of the Alliance and the birth of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nMost of the prominent MPs retained their seats. Notable failures included [[Enoch Powell]] (the controversial former Conservative MP who had defected to the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]) and two Alliance members: Liberal [[Clement Freud]] and former SDP leader [[Roy Jenkins]] (a former Labour Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer).\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the various unionist parties maintained an [[electoral pact]] (with few dissenters) in opposition to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]. However, the Ulster Unionists lost two seats to the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]].\n\nThe election victory won by the Conservatives could also arguably be attributed to the rise in average [[Standard of living|living standards]] that had taken place during their time in office. As noted by [[Dennis Kavanagh]] and [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] in their study on the 1987 election:{{quote|Since 1987 the Conservatives had located a large constituency of \"winners\", people who have an interest in the return of a Conservative government. It includes much of the affluent South, home-owners, share-owners, and most of those in work, whose standard of living, measured in post-tax incomes, has risen appreciably since 1979.{{sfn|Butler|Kavanagh|1988|p=277}}\n}}\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | \u2193{{fsp}}\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n|

The election was the third consecutive general election victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and second landslide under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who became the first Prime Minister since the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]] in [[1820 United Kingdom general election|1820]] to lead a party into three successive electoral victories.\n\nThe Conservatives ran a campaign focusing on lower taxes, a strong economy and strong defence. They also emphasised that unemployment had fallen below the 3&nbsp;million mark for the first time since 1981, and inflation was standing at 4%, its lowest level for some twenty years. The tabloid media also had strong support for the Conservative Party, particularly ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which ran anti-Labour articles with headlines such as \"Why I'm backing Kinnock, by [[Stalin]]\".\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Neil Kinnock]], was slowly moving towards a more [[centrism|centrist]] policy platform. The main aim of the Labour Party was simply to re-establish itself as the main progressive [[centre-left]] alternative to the Conservatives, after the rise of the [[Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) forced Labour onto the defensive. Indeed, the Labour Party succeeded in doing so at this general election. The [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] between the SDP and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was renewed but co-leaders [[David Owen]] and [[David Steel]] could not agree whether to support either major party in the event of a [[hung parliament]].\n\nThe Conservatives were returned to government, having suffered a net loss of only 21 seats, leaving them with 376 MPs and a second landslide majority of 102. Labour succeeded in resisting the challenge by the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance to become the main opposition. Moreover, Labour managed to increase its vote share in Scotland, Wales and the North of England. Yet Labour still returned only 229 MPs to Westminster, and in certain London constituencies which Labour had held before the election, the Conservatives actually made gains.\n\nThe election was a disappointment for the Alliance, who saw its vote share fall and suffered a net loss of one seat as well as former SDP leader [[Roy Jenkins]] losing his seat. This led to the two parties eventually merging completely to become the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. In Northern Ireland, the main unionist parties maintained their alliance in opposition to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], however the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionists]] lost two seats to the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]].\n\nThe 1987 election was the last in which the Conservatives won the popular vote in a general election by more than 10 points until the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]], and the last time they would hold more than 336 seats in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] until the 58th Parliament following the 2019 election. The 49th Parliament is the last time a Conservative government has lasted a full term with an overall majority of seats in Parliament.\n\nThe election night was covered live on the BBC and presented by [[David Dimbleby]], [[Peter Snow]] and [[Sir Robin Day]].<ref>{{YouTube |id=wTPxE8oC0bI |title=BBC Election 1987 coverage}}</ref> It was also broadcast on ITV and presented by [[Sir Alastair Burnet]], [[Peter Sissons]] and [[Alastair Stewart]].\n\nThe 1987 general election saw the election of the first [[Afro-Caribbean]] members of Parliament: [[Diane Abbott]], [[Paul Boateng]] and [[Bernie Grant]].  MPs leaving the House of Commons as a result of this election included former Labour Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]], [[Keith Joseph, Baron Joseph|Keith Joseph]], [[James Prior, Baron Prior|James Prior]], [[Ian Mikardo]], [[Roy Jenkins]], former Health Minister [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Clement Freud]].\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1979|1983|1987|1992|1997}}\n\n==Campaign and policies==\nThe Conservatives' campaign emphasised lower taxes, a strong economy and defence, and also employed rapid-response reactions to take advantage of Labour errors.  [[Norman Tebbit]] and [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] spearheaded the Conservative campaign. However, when on \"Wobbly Thursday\" it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a 2% Conservative lead, the \"exiles\" camp of [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]], [[Timothy Bell, Baron Bell|Tim Bell]] and the [[Young & Rubicam]] firm advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young's memoirs, Young got Tebbit by the lapels and shook him, shouting: \"Norman, listen to me, we're about to lose this fucking election.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2003|p=522}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/03/has-gordon-brown-delivered-his-last-budget-the-truth-is-that-blair-hasnt-yet-decided |title=Has Gordon Brown delivered his last Budget? The truth is that Blair hasn't yet decided |date=19 March 2005 |work=The Spectator |first=Peter |last=Oborne |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> In his memoirs Tebbit defends the Conservative campaign: \"We finished exactly as planned on the ground where Labour was weak and we were strong&mdash;defence, taxation, and the economy.\"{{sfn|Tebbit|1988|p=336}} During the election campaign however Tebbit and Thatcher argued.{{sfn|Thatcher|1993|p=584}}\n\nBell and Saatchi and Saatchi produced memorable posters for the Conservatives, such as a picture of a British soldier's arms raised in surrender with the caption \"Labour's Policy On Arms\"\u2014a reference to Labour's policy of [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]]. The first Conservative [[party political broadcast]] played on the theme of \"Freedom\" and ended with a fluttering Union Jack, the hymn ''[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]'' (which Thatcher would later quote in her \"[[Sermon on the Mound]]\") and the slogan \"It's Great To Be Great Again\".\n\nThe Labour campaign was a marked change from previous efforts; professionally directed by [[Peter Mandelson]] and [[Bryan Gould]], it concentrated on presenting and improving [[Neil Kinnock]]'s image to the electorate. Labour's first party political broadcast, dubbed ''Kinnock: The Movie'', was directed by [[Hugh Hudson]] of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' fame, and concentrated on portraying Kinnock as a caring, compassionate family man. It was filmed at the Great Orme in Wales and had \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" as its music.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pr1b5 |work=The 80s with Dominic Sandbrook |title=World in Motion |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> He was particularly critical of the high unemployment that the government's economic policies had resulted in, as well as condemning the wait for treatment that many patients had endured on the [[National Health Service]]. Kinnock's personal popularity jumped 16 points overnight after the initial broadcast.{{sfn|Butler|Kavanagh|1988|p=154}}\n\nOn 24 May, Kinnock was interviewed by [[David Frost]] and claimed that Labour's alternative defence strategy in the event of a Soviet attack would be \"using the resources you've got to make any occupation totally untenable\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In a speech two days later Thatcher attacked Labour's defence policy as a programme for \"defeat, surrender, occupation, and finally, prolonged guerrilla fighting&nbsp;...

The BBC announced the result at 02:35. Increasing [[Polarization (politics)|polarisation]] marked divisions across the country; the Conservatives dominated [[Southern England]] and took additional seats from Labour in London and the rest of the South, but performed less well in [[Northern England]], Scotland and Wales, losing many of the seats they had won there in previous elections. Yet the overall result of this election proved that the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]] retained significant support, with the Conservatives given a third convincing majority.\n\nDespite initial optimism and the professional campaign run by [[Neil Kinnock]], the election brought only twenty additional seats for Labour from the 1983 Conservative landslide. In many southern areas, the Labour vote actually fell, with the party losing seats in London. However, it represented a decisive victory against the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance and marked out the Labour Party as the main opposition to the Conservative Party. This was in stark contrast to 1983, when the Alliance almost matched Labour in terms of votes\u2014although Labour had almost 10 times as many seats as the Alliance.\n\nThe result for the Alliance was a disappointment, in that they had hoped to overtake Labour as the second party in the UK in terms of vote share. Instead, they lost one net seat and saw their vote share drop by almost 3%, with a widening gap of 8% between them and the Labour Party (compared to a 2% gap four years before). These results would eventually lead to the end of the Alliance and the birth of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nMost of the prominent MPs retained their seats. Notable failures included [[Enoch Powell]] (the controversial former Conservative MP who had defected to the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]) and two Alliance members: Liberal [[Clement Freud]] and former SDP leader [[Roy Jenkins]] (a former Labour Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer).\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the various unionist parties maintained an [[electoral pact]] (with few dissenters) in opposition to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]. However, the Ulster Unionists lost two seats to the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]].\n\nThe election victory won by the Conservatives could also arguably be attributed to the rise in average [[Standard of living|living standards]] that had taken place during their time in office. As noted by [[Dennis Kavanagh]] and [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] in their study on the 1987 election:{{quote|Since 1987 the Conservatives had located a large constituency of \"winners\", people who have an interest in the return of a Conservative government.

Goldwater]] in [[Archie Comics]] who first appeared in the first Archie story, from ''[[Pep Comics]]'' #22 (December 1941). He is the drummer of [[the Archies]] and is son of Forsythe Pendleton Jones II; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips, he himself is identified as John Jugworth Jones III (and in one strip, likely due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error, as Forsythe Van Jones). He has a white [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] named Hot Dog and a younger sister, [[Jellybean Jones|Forsythia \"Jellybean\" Jones]]\n\nJughead (shortened to Jug or Juggie) is the best friend of vocalist/guitarist [[Archie Andrews]]. Jughead is a smart, sharp-tongued, laid-back, and eccentric high school student. He is obsessed with eating food and in some storylines is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. Most see him as being lazy. He can be identified by his long nose, half-closed eyes, \"S\" sweatshirt, and crown-like button [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] hat, called a [[whoopee cap]].<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://learning2share.blogspot.com/2009/04/search-term-jugheads-hat.html |title=I'm Learning To Share!: Search term: \"Jughead's hat\" |publisher=Learning2share.blogspot.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> Jughead is portrayed by [[Cole Sprouse]] in the live-action [[The CW|CW]] series, ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.

He is considered a bit of an oddity, but prefers his [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] as opposed to going along with others' styles. His many quirks make him the butt of teasing and abuse from Reggie, Veronica, and even other classmates and teachers. Many episodes involve Reggie and Jughead trying to outdo one another with pranks and bets, and Jughead almost always comes out the victor. He is revealed to be extremely clever and creative when necessary and he often takes advantage of Reggie's and his other tormentors' weaknesses (and has fun all the while).\n\nIn the earlier comics, a running gag involved various characters trying to discover Jughead's real name, while Jughead thwarted their efforts. In one story, [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] and [[Reggie Mantle]] go to the school office, where a woman tells them that Jughead's real first name is Steve. After Archie and Reggie leave the office, the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead's aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name (Forsythe) hidden. In another story (issue #1 of \"The Jughead Jones Comics Digest,\" June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero. For a brief time, Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor. After learning that this ancestor was married nine times, Jughead reverted to his nickname. In the Little Archie series, his real name is revealed by [[Miss Grundy]] at the start of class.\nHe also believes his name attracts girls as in a strip, his name was mentioned and it made the girls crazed for him.\n\nAnother mystery that follows Jughead's character is the meaning of the \"S\" on his sweatshirt.  This remains a mystery to this day,  although many stories have hinted at a meaning. In Jughead #30 (1992), when his psychiatrist, Sara, asked him \"why an 'S'?\" he replied \"I dunno!  My third cousin was called skinny...\" The triangular banner on the cover of issue 140 of ''Archie & Friends'' shows that the \"S\" stands for ''Silby'', as in Silby High School, which he attended for a few months as a freshman. At one time after his sweater was filled with holes due to what he thought was a moth when it was actually a chemical accident caused in lab class, he reveals that he simply likes the letter S and finds it \"compatible,\" because the letter can stand for \"soup, sandwich, steak and all kinds of goodies!\" after his friends ask him. Betty rolls her eyes at the explanation and adds, \"S stands for \"sorry I asked\"!\" Another theory is that he is a non-conformist so when everyone wears \"R\" which stands for Riverdale he just goes with the next letter \"S\".\n\n=== Food obsession ===\nJughead is known for his love of food, especially [[hamburger]]s, and his ability to consume absurdly large quantities in a single sitting without getting sick or gaining weight, although he often sports a pot-belly immediately after a particularly large meal.  Jughead is a preferred customer of most of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale's]] food establishments, especially [[List of Archie Comics characters#Pop Tate|Pop Tate]]'s Chock'lit Shoppe, except when he is behind on paying his usually lengthy tab.  In one story, he was given a \"Restaurant Club Card\" and ate out at high-class restaurants until he found out how much interest the card charged, and Pop Tate loaned him the money on the condition that he eat exclusively at the Chok'lit Shoppe.  His ability to eat so much food without gaining weight is attributed to a very rare and implausibly high [[metabolism]].  He once claimed that he weighed 300 pounds after a meal, although he is usually portrayed as slim and healthy.\n\nJughead's special abilities concerning food extend to being able to identify food in a sealed can by smell, and being able to detect the slightest flaws in food preparation by taste.  As such, he is a respected food critic, as well as a gourmet chef himself. One time, when he sought out [[Miss Grundy]]'s help with his creative writing, she suggested that he write about a subject he knew, leading to the \"Forsythe P. Jones Cookbook\".\n\nJughead often participates in eating contests, usually winning outright, or else easily coming from behind after comic distractions, and often with room to spare while the competitor retires unwell.  In a citywide eating contest, he ate a colossal burger made up of sixteen different burgers. Jughead also set two world records for eating pizza; one for speed-eating a pizza, and another for eating the most pizzas in one sitting: twelve.  Jughead's appetite is so large that even if he eats shortly before such contests, it does not affect his performance.  For example, a rival high school once sent a girl, Jane Dough, to take Jughead to various restaurants and feed him as much as possible. Amazingly, Jughead still managed to win the contest.  He explained to Jane that top athletes need to train constantly in order to stay in shape, and she actually helped him \"train\" for the contest.<ref>{{cite comic|date=June 1984|title=Archie at Riverdale High|issue=97|story=The Great All-American Pembrooke-Riverdale Food-Eating Contest!}}</ref>\n\nOne running gag depicts Jughead visiting restaurants that promise \"all you can eat\" special deals, with the devastated restaurateur closing down as Jughead leaves.<ref>e.g. {{cite comic|date=April 1992|title=Jughead with Archie Digest Magazine|issue=110|story=cover}}; {{cite journal|date=Oct 2000|title=The One-Millionth Customer!|magazine=Jughead's Double Digest Magazine|issue=70|issn=1061-5482}}</ref>\n\nDespite his appetite, Jughead is not known to be stingy with food, or to let others go hungry.  When a store selling [[penny candy]] opened in Riverdale, he spent his whole allowance on a huge bag of candy, only to meet a penniless young boy outside the shop. Jughead wrestled with his desire, but he chose to give the candy to the boy.  In a similar story, Jughead met a homeless person who liked the same kind of pizza as he did, and decided to give him the pizza he had just purchased. In another story, after winning three pizzas a week for six months for being a pizzeria's one-millionth customer, he donated them all to a soup kitchen where he volunteered.\n\nBecause of his well-known food obsession, Jughead was shown eating a hamburger on the facades of the short-lived [[Archie's Family Restaurants]].<ref name=\"How the Industry Works\">{{cite book | last1 = Rhoades | first1 = Shirrel | title = Comics Books: How the Industry Works | publisher = Peter Lang Publishing, Inc. | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC& | accessdate = 2017-03-22 | isbn = 978-0820488929}}</ref>\n\n===Jughead's hat===\nJughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin. This type of crown-shaped cap, called a [[whoopee cap]], sometimes a \"jughead cap\" or \"crown\", was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s. It was made from a man's felt [[fedora]] hat with the brim trimmed in a zig-zag and turned up.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/> Bottle caps could be \"pinned\" in place using the cap's removable cork lining. In the 1920s and 1930s, college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes, and such caps were often worn by mechanics.<ref>''[[Jughead Magazine|Jughead and Friends]]'' No.&nbsp;25 (February 2008)</ref> Similar caps have appeared on other comic book/strip, cartoon, and children's book characters such as [[List of Little Lulu characters#Main characters|Eddie Stimson]] in ''Little Lulu'', [[Little Audrey#Comic books|Melvin Wisenheimer]] in ''Little Audrey'', [[List of Berenstain Bears characters|Skuzz]] in The Berenstain Bears, and [[Encyclopedia Brown#Recurring characters|Bugs Meany]] in ''Encyclopedia Brown'' as well as on [[Goober Pyle]] on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character \"Freak #1\" in ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''. Jughead's hat was recolored in black in the [[Filmation]] cartoons and pink in ''[[The New Archies]]''. Over the course of the character's publication, Jughead's hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable \"crown\" appearance.\n\nThough some view the hat as strange and immature, Jughead considers it a good luck charm and when it is taken from him, misfortune comes his way. While on the school baseball team, Jughead was pulled aside and reprimanded by school principal Mr. Weatherbee for wearing the hat instead of a proper baseball uniform cap. Jughead complied, but then started performing so badly that Weatherbee was forced to relent.\n\nIn the \"Time Police\" comic, there is a double of his beanie given to him by an unknown benefactor (later revealed to be himself) that allows him to travel in time.\n\nSome stories showed him wear a unique pin on his hat which attracts many girls to him, so he hid it to avoid the crowd of girls rushing him.\n\nThe hat also seems to define part of Jughead's personality. One story has the gang try to convince him to try a different hat, but it is revealed that whatever hat he tried on changed his personality to suit the hat. When they had him try on a detective hat, he zeroed in on clues that would have gotten Archie in trouble with Betty and Veronica, and took a hair from Reggie's sweater that implied that he sneaked a date with Midge behind Moose's back (the look on both of their faces imply he was on to something). Jughead also stated that he felt naked without a hat. Finally, Veronica gave him a special hat to try on. When he did, everyone said it suited him (it was an ugly thing but looked comical. She said she was saving it for a Mad Hatter party). Jughead tried wearing it for a day at school, but scared several students, teachers, and even Miss Beazly the cafeteria lady) they begged him to go back to his trademark hat. When he asked what they'd do if he did, they offered him a platter of hamburgers and he happily agreed.\n\nIn Jughead and Friends Digest #25 story \"The Secret of Jughead's Hat\" his cap is destroyed in a laundry accident. Wendy Weatherbee (Principal Weatherbee's niece) replaces the lost hat by doing exactly as explained above when she takes an old Fedora and cuts it and shapes it to remake the whoopee cap or crown.\n\n===Family and friends===\nJughead's best friend is [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]], despite their personality difference. Archie was the first person that Jughead met upon moving to Riverdale, and he is often dragged into Archie's schemes and antics. Jughead is usually the first one to bail Archie out of trouble (though some times he only makes things worse). Jughead, extremely loyal, is willing to do almost anything to help his friend, something that Archie occasionally takes for granted.\n\nReggie Mantle is another one of Jughead's close friends, though his and Jughead's relationship is defined by their constant competition. Reggie never loses an opportunity to insult Jughead (\"needle-nose\" being his favorite nickname) and Jughead often responds with tricks to aggravate Reggie. Though it often appears they hate each other, and neither will admit otherwise, they really do care for one another. Jughead will even help Reggie escape being injured when [[Moose Mason]] is angry with him.\n\nAlongside Archie, [[Betty Cooper]] frequently slips into the best friend role for Jughead in the comics. Their mutual love and appreciation for food (she cooks, he eats), and continuously going to bat for each other have made their friendship a stronghold in the comics. While generally disinterested in matters of the heart, Jughead frequently stands up for Betty when Archie breaks her heart. In one comic, Jughead tells Betty that if he were to ever kiss a girl willingly, it would be her.\n\nJughead and [[Veronica Lodge]] are constantly arguing. Veronica cannot stand his laid-back attitude witticisms, and Jughead enjoys teasing her and making her lose her temper with clever insults. Their relationship would be considered that of \"frenemies\". Although at times, he relishes causing her to get angry because sometimes he sees her as an uncaring selfish snob. He once told Veronica he was \"mad with passion\" for her, and began popping up wherever she went, to get her off his back after she criticized him publicly. They were once cast together in a school play, which required them to kiss. Due to the way Jughead kissed her, she was caught up in the moment and fell in love with him for a while. However, Jughead managed to get her over her crush, with the help of a garlic and onion sandwich.<ref>Jughead's Double Digest #99: \"Shakespeare Anyone?\" (January 2004)</ref>\n\nJughead's other friends include [[Dilton Doiley]] and [[Moose Mason]]. Other than Dilton, Jughead probably gets along with Moose better than the other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose's girlfriend [[Midge Klump|Midge]]). Jughead's nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he gets along with Dilton.\n\nJughead's family includes his father, also named Forsythe, his mother Gladys, and in later comics, his younger sister Jellybean. He also has many eccentric relatives including slightly-addled Uncle Herman, or \"Doc Jones\", a daffy and slightly pompous [[inventor]] whose creations usually wreak havoc on Jughead and/or his friends and his lookalike younger cousin, Souphead. Other one-time relatives appear frequently.  Jughead also tells many stories of his ancestors, who prove to be quite as interesting as himself. A 1970s \"Archie\" cartoon episode featured Jughead's paternal grandparents\u2014''both'' of whom resemble Jughead.\n\nAnother acquaintance of Jughead's is Trula Twyst, Riverdale High's budding pop psychologist, who is constantly trying to analyze Jughead to determine what makes him so odd. The two share a strange love/hate relationship that would have gone much smoother had they not met the way they did- Trula tricked Jughead into dating her in order to become more popular.\n\nIn one story, Jughead claimed his great-grandmother was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] \"from the Pawtuxet tribe,\" despite the fact that the [[Patuxet]] were killed off by 1622.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[George Gladir|Gladir, George]] | artist=[[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]|coartists=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | story=Liberty Island | title=Life with Archie | volume=1 | issue=255 | date=July, 1986 | publisher=Archie | location= |page=5 }}</ref> In another story from the same era, he claimed his great-great-grandfather was \"an [[eskimo]],\" who was \"the only cop north of Nome...'Ol' Bluenose Jones' they called him!\" <ref name=\"Giant Box of Comics\">{{cite web|url=http://giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com/2016/05/an-interesting-discovery.html |title=An Interesting Discovery |publisher=giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com |date=2016-05-06 |accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously. In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica, which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes, since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents.\n\nIn the \"Mad Magazine\" universe, Jughead's doppelg\u00e4nger is nicknamed Bottleneck. Bottleneck wears a beanie that resembles a broken bottleneck. His best friend (and fellow juvenile delinquent) is Starchie.<ref>{{cite comic|story=STARCHIE! |title=Mad Magazine|issue=12|date=June 1954|writer=Harvey Kurtzman|artist=Will Elder|pages=1-8}}, reprinted in ''MAD About the Fifties'' (1997), QPB</ref>\n\n===Miniseries===\n[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|''Jughead's Time Police'']] was a series that began in 1990 featuring Jughead as a hero of the 29th century and a member of the Time Police, an organization that ensures history to remain the same for the future's sake. In this series, the beanie gives Jughead the ability to time travel by thinking. With his supervisor, [[List of Archie Comics characters#January McAndrews|Marshal January McAndrews]], Jughead repairs disturbances in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_december.htm |title=December \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232558/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_december.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref> The series was rebooted in 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/comics/2019/06/12/jugheads-time-police-1-review-archie-comics-riverdale/ |title=December Jughead's Time Police #1 Review: A Charmingly Human Sci-Fi Adventure|publisher=ComicBook.com|date=June 12, 2019|accessdate=2019-06-13 }}</ref> with Jughead building a time machine to undo the mistakes he has made, forcing January McAndrews to intervene.<ref>''Jughead's Time Police'' (2019) #1</ref>\n\nOther spin-offs include [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Diner|''Jughead's Diner'']] in 1990, where he ran a [[diner]] with an eclectic cast of patrons; and ''Jughead's Fantasy'', resulting from ''Jughead's Folly'', lasted for three issues and featured Jughead's dreams of various [[alter-ego]]s, including \"Sir Jugalot\", \"Peter Goon--Private Eye\", and \"Son of Hercules\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_july.htm |title=July \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232604/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_july.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref> Jughead also featured in [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Explorers of the Unknown|''Explorers of the Unknown'']], playing Squint, a daredevil escape artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_october.htm |title=October \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232614/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_october.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Sexuality==\nJughead is known for his disinterests in romantic relationships with anyone. Jughead's philosophy on romantic relationships, gained from observing Archie's romantic entanglements, is that dating complicates a guy's life and deprives him of cash that could be used to buy burgers. This often attracts girls rather than repels them. His most ardent admirer is [[Ethel Muggs]], an awkward but very friendly girl who chases after Jughead at every opportunity, despite Jughead's constant and blunt refusals.  Later story-lines showed a decrease in her obsession with him, and even show her dating other guys, surprisingly making Jughead jealous. Jughead secretly enjoys the attention, although he claims he puts up with Ethel's company only if she cooks for him. He has shown romantic interest in her on rare occasions, and eventually fell in love with her in the ''Life With Archie: The Married Life'' series where the \"Archie Marries Veronica\" stories ended with Jughead and Ethel's wedding.\n\nIn 2016, Jughead's orientation was confirmed to be [[asexuality|asexual]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/archie-jughead-asexual.html|title=Archie Comic Reveals Jughead Is Asexual|author= Abraham Riesman|date=February 8, 2016|work=Vulture|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> in the stories of Chip Zdarsky (and later Ryan North and Mark Waid) for the ''[[Jughead (comic book)|Jughead]]'' comics as part of the ''[[New Riverdale]]'' line.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chip Zdarsky Opens Up About Jughead|url = http://comicbook.com/2015/09/25/chip-zdarsky-opens-up-about-jughead/|website = Comicbook.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref> Zdarsky said of his run on the book that \"the next writer could make him discover girls or boys or both and that's totally fine.

There has never been one consistent canon explanation for Jughead's avoidance of girls and dating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ArchieComics|title=Archie Comics/Characters|website = TV Tropes}}</ref>  In one story, Jughead declares, \"I don't hate girls\u2014I just love food more!\"<ref>{{cite comic|story=Double Your Pleasure|title=Archie's Pals 'n' Gals|issue=212|date=January 1990}}</ref>  In the story \"Phood Phobia\", Archie and [[Dilton Doiley]] discover a hidden layer to this: it turns out that Jughead is actually nervous around girls, and he turns to food for comfort.  When confronted with this, Jughead is stunned; finding out that girls are the reason he enjoys food so much makes him lose his appetite.  In another story, when Jughead saw that [[Miss Grundy]] was upset on her birthday, he rallied the other students to cheer her up.\n\nIn \"A Lass From The Past\", written by Nate Butler and first appearing in ''Jughead'' #5 (April 1988), Jughead explains the reason he does not chase after girls is because of a childhood heartbreak, sustained before he moved to [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]].  Little Jughead befriended Joani and they had a [[puppy love]] relationship.  Jughead's family moved to Riverdale and he had to leave Joani behind.  Determined to not endure heartbreak again, he swore off girls, keeping little Joani's picture in his wallet as a reminder.  That changed when Debbie moved to town (in \"Jughead's Journal,\" written by Rod Ollerenshaw and also first appearing in Jughead #5), and Jughead began to overcome his old heartbreak as they started dating.  However, Joani suddenly visits town.  Now a young woman, she tells Jughead that she never forgot him and still has a crush on him, and they share their first kiss.  Before Jughead decides whether he wants to pursue a relationship with Joani, she leaves him, but with a promise that they will be together again. The comic even had Jughead say, \"Sometimes, life is just more interesting than burgers and shakes.\"<ref>{{cite comic|title=Jughead Jones Digest Magazine|issue=81|date=April 1993}}</ref>  For a while, Debbie and Joani formed Jughead's own love triangle, but fans did not like it, so both girls disappeared and Jughead reverted to his classic independent lifestyle.  A few years later, a girl named [[List of Archie Comics characters#Trula Twyst|Trula Twyst]] appeared. She tends to drive Jughead crazy with her ability to predict his next moves, and they developed a [[love-hate relationship]].\n\nAnother thread that has run through stories involves a psychic experience he is supposed to have had, caused by an odd pin he wears on his hat.  In the early 1990s, Jughead had three girlfriends: [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Debbie]], [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Joani]], and [[Minor characters in Archie Comics#January McAndrews|January McAndrews]].  The latter is Archie's descendant in the future, who starred with Jughead in [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|Jughead's Time Police]], a short-lived spinoff comic about their adventures traveling through time.\n\n==Musical interests==\nJughead was the [[drummer]] for [[The Archies]]. In one four-part story, which included many flashbacks of Jughead's life, Archie had commented that the reason he'd chosen the position of drummer was that he was too introverted to play at the front of the stage. Another reason was that he could put food in his drums to eat while he played.\n\nHe has also professed a love for [[jazz]] music, once detailed in an issue of ''[[Jughead Magazine]]'' where he develops an obsession with an obscure [[jazz]] [[drum]]mer named \"Crazy\" Willie Jim. After collecting his records, Jughead finally met Jim, who was now very old, ailing and reclusive, playing on a street corner. Jughead convinced Jim that he was trustworthy and they became fast friends. Jim even played with The Archies at one of their gigs. Jim died very soon after, so Jughead sat in with Jim's friends on the corner to play one last, mournful version of \"[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]\".\n\n==Special abilities==\nIn spite of his reputation as slow and lazy, Jughead is frequently shown to be extremely intelligent, and often surprises his skeptical friends (notably [[Reggie Mantle]] and [[Veronica Lodge]]) with his vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, including history, [[Shakespeare]], sports, and science. In several issues, Jughead has demonstrated that his IQ is well above average. He is an extremely good student, which exasperates his teachers when he sometimes pays them no attention.\n\nHis intelligence varies from story to story. In many cases, he has trouble keeping decent grades, but was once given an award for being the best student in the school. Once, in [[Little Archie]], it was revealed that as a student, Jughead was second only to [[Dilton Doiley]]. His intelligence is displayed by his sharp wit, the occasional deep insight, and the odd chance he gets to upstage or outsmart [[Reggie Mantle]]. In one issue, [[Mr. Weatherbee]] tries to cut down on Jughead's food consumption, only to realize that Jughead's brain stops functioning without massive amounts of food. Professor [[Flutesnoot]] implies that Jughead's brain burns all the calories, which keeps him thin.\n\nJughead is also a talented artist, and refers to his works as his \"Dipsy Doodles\", which feature in one-page comic strips. Often, what he paints comes to life or becomes a real, three-dimensional object. Another recurring gag, featured in the 1960s, was \"Professor Jughead\", where he would wear a gown and mortarboard and lecture to his fellow teenagers about subjects he considered relevant. However, the content of the lesson was often nonsensical and useless in real life. ''Professor Jughead's Loony Laws'' was a strip in which he presented various [[dumb laws]].<ref>{{cite comic|date=April 1989|story=Professor Jughead's Loony Laws|title=Jughead|volume=2|issue=11|writer=Rich Margopoulos|artist=Doug Crane|coartists=Jon d'Agostino|ID={{issn|0022-5991}} }}</ref> One strip explores the fact that Jughead is seldom drawn with his eyes open by noting that Jughead has the unusual ability to \"see\" with his eyes completely shut, and not see with them open.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoys playing [[video games]], reading [[comic books]], and [[skateboarding]]. It was also noted in one issue that he has an interest in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] as well, with titles such as [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Lunar]], [[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Tall 33]], [[Robotech|Tech Robo]], and [[Magic Knight Rayearth|Tragic Knight Sayearth]]. In the late 1980s, Jughead became obsessed with the skateboarding subculture, and his interests and taste in fashion were revamped to fit this. A number of short-lived characters were added to the ''Jughead'' comics, including his paraplegic African-American crush [[List of Archie Comics characters#Anita Chavita|Anita]]; blind rival for Ethel's affections [[List of Archie Comics characters#Jeffrey|Jeff]] and his guide dog Spike; and heavy metal band [[List of Archie Comics characters#The Potholes|The Potholes]]. However, this makeover only lasted for a few years.\n\nJughead rarely takes an interest in sports, but has a few unexpected athletic talents. These are often side effects of his other activities. For example, he is a very fast runner due to his constant evasion of [[Ethel Muggs|Ethel]] and his determination to be at the front of the lunchline every day. Coach Kleats often tries to recruit him for various school teams, usually without longterm success. Over the years, he has been seen as a basketball player, baseball pitcher, martial artist, swimmer, dancer and gymnast.\n\nMany stories revolve around other characters making comments about Jughead's appetite. One story has Dilton Doiley making calculations to scientifically prove that it's impossible for Jughead to eat the way that he does, and even convinces Pop Tate to cook everything Jughead ate earlier to prove it. When the entire gang isn't paying attention, Jughead ate all the food and ended the story by saying that if they didn't believe it they could make the food and he'd eat it again. Another story has Jughead going against a guy from another group in an eating contest. The rival gang sends a girl to feed Jughead to fill him up the night before in an effort to cheat but he manages to win anyway. In still another, Archie expresses concern over Jughead's eating and lack of exercise, which prompts Reggie to show off lifting a single crate of Pop's bottles over his head. Jughead helps Pop by effortlessly lifting three crates at once and carrying them to the back room, stunning Archie and Reggie. Unnerving them even more, he rips out a stool that Pop said he could take for a souvenir (he was replacing his counter stools later that day) with one hand again with no effort. In that story, he says he eats to get strong, cracking up Archie and Reggie, but they change their mind when they see he's very strong, and even take up eating in an effort to get strong, with no success.\n\nOften, when Jughead attempts to join a team, he ends up with an undesirable menial task, such as water-boy or equipment manager. However, he often takes part in less strenuous school activities, such as the school newspaper, ''the Blue and Gold''. His reputation as a food critic and his unbiased views of the school teams make him a valuable member of the staff. In some stories, Jughead has been shown to have supernatural abilities that are never seen again. These include controlling weather, giving the evil-eye, learning the skills presented in any book he reads, and predicting the future.\n\nIn the \"[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Super Teens|Super Teens]]\" stories (where several of the main ''Archie'' characters are secretly [[superheroes]]), Jughead could become '''Captain Hero''', gaining a caped costume and more muscular physique (varying from story to story), but retaining his crown-shaped cap. Captain Hero appeared when Jughead recites the magic incantation (similar to [[Green Lantern]]'s oath):\n\n''Teeny weeny magic beanie pointing towards the sky; give me muscle, power, vigor - form a super guy!''\n\nCaptain Hero often seemed to possess just the right powers for the problem at hand. These were never completely defined, but he maintained certain \"stock\" superhuman powers, such as flight, enhanced strength and resistance to injury. Early on, Captain Hero was often the most serious and competent of the Super Teens, and the others would defer to his leadership, in contrast to Jughead's perceived status as Archie's sidekick and a generally lazy individual.\n\n==Hot Dog==\n[[File:Jughd.jpg|thumb|Jughead and Hot Dog]]\nHot Dog is a long-haired [[mixed-breed dog|mutt]] who resembles a white [[Old English Sheepdog]]. He belongs to Jughead, although when he first appeared in ''Pep Comics'' #224 (December 1968), he belonged to Archie. Hot Dog switched owners frequently in his early appearances, but was eventually given a permanent home with Jughead.\n\nHot Dog usually thinks like a [[human]], in that his thoughts are presented in [[thought bubble]]s. He is lazy, constantly hungry, and, much like Jughead, has a dislike for [[Reggie Mantle]].\n\nHot Dog is usually considered a member of [[List of Archie Comics characters#Main characters|Archie's Gang]]. He tends to be attracted to [[Veronica Lodge]]\u2019s pedigreed dogs, and even had a litter of puppies with one of them, a poodle named Lucretia, much to Veronica's chagrin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the 1970s series ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'', Hot Dog has a [[sidekick]], Chili Dog, who is smaller and red-haired. A [[running gag]] is the two dogs' \"battles\" with Sabrina's cat [[Salem Saberhagen]]. In the [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Hot Dog|alternate universe limited series ''Jughead's Pal, Hot Dog'']], when Jughead's family objects to Hot Dog living indoors because he is covered in dirt, [[Dilton Doiley]] builds Hot Dog a [[doghouse]] full of whimsical inventions. Hot Dog's sidekick in that short-lived series is a chihuahua named Pablito.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |title=November \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232609/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== In other media ===\nIn the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[The Archie Show]]'', Hot Dog is the mascot for [[The Archies]] and is often portrayed as pretending to \"conduct\" the band.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Afterlife with Archie''===\nJughead appears in the first issue of ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]'' before being bitten by a resurrected Hot Dog, which transforms him into a zombie.

This version of Jughead is markedly different from the comic character, exhibiting a darker, moodier demeanor. In the show, Jughead wears an ordinary dark gray knitted hat with points and pins, but appears in a dream sequence wearing his distinctive crown cap and \"S\" sweatshirt. His mother and sister are mentioned but absent, having left due to his father's drinking. His father, F.P., is leader of the Southside Serpents, and Jughead, choosing not to live with him, is homeless. In the first-season finale, the Serpents offer Jughead one of their jackets, essentially making him an honorary member. In the second season, he undergoes an initiation that includes a brutal beating to become a full-fledged member. Over time, he becomes a de facto leader of the teenagers in the gang, and in the second-season finale, after he attempts to save the Serpents from a fight with a rival gang that badly outnumbers them by trading himself, F.P. retires and names him as his successor.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n===References===\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Hal |authorlink=Hal Erickson (author) |year=2005 |title=Television Cartoon Shows |edition=2nd|volume=1 |publisher=McFardland and Company|isbn=07864-2255-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://archiecomics.com Official website]\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/jughead.htm Archie's Pal, Jughead] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Goldwater]] in [[Archie Comics]] who first appeared in the first Archie story, from ''[[Pep Comics]]'' #22 (December 1941). He is the drummer of [[the Archies]] and is son of Forsythe Pendleton Jones II; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips, he himself is identified as John Jugworth Jones III (and in one strip, likely due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error, as Forsythe Van Jones). He has a white [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] named Hot Dog and a younger sister, [[Jellybean Jones|Forsythia \"Jellybean\" Jones]]\n\nJughead (shortened to Jug or Juggie) is the best friend of vocalist/guitarist [[Archie Andrews]]. Jughead is a smart, sharp-tongued, laid-back, and eccentric high school student. He is obsessed with eating food and in some storylines is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. Most see him as being lazy. He can be identified by his long nose, half-closed eyes, \"S\" sweatshirt, and crown-like button [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] hat, called a [[whoopee cap]].<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://learning2share.blogspot.com/2009/04/search-term-jugheads-hat.html |title=I'm Learning To Share!: Search term: \"Jughead's hat\" |publisher=Learning2share.blogspot.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> Jughead is portrayed by [[Cole Sprouse]] in the live-action [[The CW|CW]] series, ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n[[Bob Montana]] stated that Jughead was a character he imagined, unlike other characters in the series who were based on people he knew.<ref name=\"Erickson92\">Erickson, 2005. p.92</ref> Montana's widow, Peg Bertholet, stated that high school friend of Montana's named Skinny Linehan supposedly had some of Jughead's peculiar traits.<ref name=\"Erickson92\" /> Bertholet has stated that the \"S\" insignia refers to a location called Skunk Hill in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] which Montana turned into Squirrel Hill.<ref name=\"ew-fa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316110,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014|date=November 8, 1991|author=Appelo, Tim|title=Forever Archie}}</ref> The \"S\" alludes to a combination of the location and Montana's elementary school athletic team near Haverhill called the Tigers.<ref name=\"ew-fa\" /> Bertholet has stated that \"S\" stands for \"'Squirrel Hill Independent Tigers,' and you couldn't abbreviate it any other way.\"<ref name=\"ew-fa\" />\n\n==History and character==\n\nJughead generally has a characteristic wry and [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] sense of humor. He is considered a bit of an oddity, but prefers his [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] as opposed to going along with others' styles. His many quirks make him the butt of teasing and abuse from Reggie, Veronica, and even other classmates and teachers. Many episodes involve Reggie and Jughead trying to outdo one another with pranks and bets, and Jughead almost always comes out the victor. He is revealed to be extremely clever and creative when necessary and he often takes advantage of Reggie's and his other tormentors' weaknesses (and has fun all the while).\n\nIn the earlier comics, a running gag involved various characters trying to discover Jughead's real name, while Jughead thwarted their efforts. In one story, [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] and [[Reggie Mantle]] go to the school office, where a woman tells them that Jughead's real first name is Steve. After Archie and Reggie leave the office, the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead's aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name (Forsythe) hidden. In another story (issue #1 of \"The Jughead Jones Comics Digest,\" June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero. For a brief time, Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor. After learning that this ancestor was married nine times, Jughead reverted to his nickname. In the Little Archie series, his real name is revealed by [[Miss Grundy]] at the start of class.\nHe also believes his name attracts girls as in a strip, his name was mentioned and it made the girls crazed for him.\n\nAnother mystery that follows Jughead's character is the meaning of the \"S\" on his sweatshirt.  This remains a mystery to this day,  although many stories have hinted at a meaning. In Jughead #30 (1992), when his psychiatrist, Sara, asked him \"why an 'S'?\" he replied \"I dunno!  My third cousin was called skinny...\" The triangular banner on the cover of issue 140 of ''Archie & Friends'' shows that the \"S\" stands for ''Silby'', as in Silby High School, which he attended for a few months as a freshman. At one time after his sweater was filled with holes due to what he thought was a moth when it was actually a chemical accident caused in lab class, he reveals that he simply likes the letter S and finds it \"compatible,\" because the letter can stand for \"soup, sandwich, steak and all kinds of goodies!\" after his friends ask him. Betty rolls her eyes at the explanation and adds, \"S stands for \"sorry I asked\"!\" Another theory is that he is a non-conformist so when everyone wears \"R\" which stands for Riverdale he just goes with the next letter \"S\".\n\n=== Food obsession ===\nJughead is known for his love of food, especially [[hamburger]]s, and his ability to consume absurdly large quantities in a single sitting without getting sick or gaining weight, although he often sports a pot-belly immediately after a particularly large meal.  Jughead is a preferred customer of most of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale's]] food establishments, especially [[List of Archie Comics characters#Pop Tate|Pop Tate]]'s Chock'lit Shoppe, except when he is behind on paying his usually lengthy tab.  In one story, he was given a \"Restaurant Club Card\" and ate out at high-class restaurants until he found out how much interest the card charged, and Pop Tate loaned him the money on the condition that he eat exclusively at the Chok'lit Shoppe.  His ability to eat so much food without gaining weight is attributed to a very rare and implausibly high [[metabolism]].  He once claimed that he weighed 300 pounds after a meal, although he is usually portrayed as slim and healthy.\n\nJughead's special abilities concerning food extend to being able to identify food in a sealed can by smell, and being able to detect the slightest flaws in food preparation by taste.  As such, he is a respected food critic, as well as a gourmet chef himself. One time, when he sought out [[Miss Grundy]]'s help with his creative writing, she suggested that he write about a subject he knew, leading to the \"Forsythe P. Jones Cookbook\".\n\nJughead often participates in eating contests, usually winning outright, or else easily coming from behind after comic distractions, and often with room to spare while the competitor retires unwell.  In a citywide eating contest, he ate a colossal burger made up of sixteen different burgers. Jughead also set two world records for eating pizza; one for speed-eating a pizza, and another for eating the most pizzas in one sitting: twelve.  Jughead's appetite is so large that even if he eats shortly before such contests, it does not affect his performance.  For example, a rival high school once sent a girl, Jane Dough, to take Jughead to various restaurants and feed him as much as possible. Amazingly, Jughead still managed to win the contest.  He explained to Jane that top athletes need to train constantly in order to stay in shape, and she actually helped him \"train\" for the contest.<ref>{{cite comic|date=June 1984|title=Archie at Riverdale High|issue=97|story=The Great All-American Pembrooke-Riverdale Food-Eating Contest!}}</ref>\n\nOne running gag depicts Jughead visiting restaurants that promise \"all you can eat\" special deals, with the devastated restaurateur closing down as Jughead leaves.<ref>e.g. {{cite comic|date=April 1992|title=Jughead with Archie Digest Magazine|issue=110|story=cover}}; {{cite journal|date=Oct 2000|title=The One-Millionth Customer!|magazine=Jughead's Double Digest Magazine|issue=70|issn=1061-5482}}</ref>\n\nDespite his appetite, Jughead is not known to be stingy with food, or to let others go hungry.  When a store selling [[penny candy]] opened in Riverdale, he spent his whole allowance on a huge bag of candy, only to meet a penniless young boy outside the shop. Jughead wrestled with his desire, but he chose to give the candy to the boy.  In a similar story, Jughead met a homeless person who liked the same kind of pizza as he did, and decided to give him the pizza he had just purchased. In another story, after winning three pizzas a week for six months for being a pizzeria's one-millionth customer, he donated them all to a soup kitchen where he volunteered.\n\nBecause of his well-known food obsession, Jughead was shown eating a hamburger on the facades of the short-lived [[Archie's Family Restaurants]].<ref name=\"How the Industry Works\">{{cite book | last1 = Rhoades | first1 = Shirrel | title = Comics Books: How the Industry Works | publisher = Peter Lang Publishing, Inc. | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC& | accessdate = 2017-03-22 | isbn = 978-0820488929}}</ref>\n\n===Jughead's hat===\nJughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin. This type of crown-shaped cap, called a [[whoopee cap]], sometimes a \"jughead cap\" or \"crown\", was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s. It was made from a man's felt [[fedora]] hat with the brim trimmed in a zig-zag and turned up.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/> Bottle caps could be \"pinned\" in place using the cap's removable cork lining. In the 1920s and 1930s, college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes, and such caps were often worn by mechanics.<ref>''[[Jughead Magazine|Jughead and Friends]]'' No.&nbsp;25 (February 2008)</ref> Similar caps have appeared on other comic book/strip, cartoon, and children's book characters such as [[List of Little Lulu characters#Main characters|Eddie Stimson]] in ''Little Lulu'', [[Little Audrey#Comic books|Melvin Wisenheimer]] in ''Little Audrey'', [[List of Berenstain Bears characters|Skuzz]] in The Berenstain Bears, and [[Encyclopedia Brown#Recurring characters|Bugs Meany]] in ''Encyclopedia Brown'' as well as on [[Goober Pyle]] on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character \"Freak #1\" in ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''. Jughead's hat was recolored in black in the [[Filmation]] cartoons and pink in ''[[The New Archies]]''. Over the course of the character's publication, Jughead's hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable \"crown\" appearance.\n\nThough some view the hat as strange and immature, Jughead considers it a good luck charm and when it is taken from him, misfortune comes his way. While on the school baseball team, Jughead was pulled aside and reprimanded by school principal Mr. Weatherbee for wearing the hat instead of a proper baseball uniform cap. Jughead complied, but then started performing so badly that Weatherbee was forced to relent.\n\nIn the \"Time Police\" comic, there is a double of his beanie given to him by an unknown benefactor (later revealed to be himself) that allows him to travel in time.\n\nSome stories showed him wear a unique pin on his hat which attracts many girls to him, so he hid it to avoid the crowd of girls rushing him.\n\nThe hat also seems to define part of Jughead's personality. One story has the gang try to convince him to try a different hat, but it is revealed that whatever hat he tried on changed his personality to suit the hat. When they had him try on a detective hat, he zeroed in on clues that would have gotten Archie in trouble with Betty and Veronica, and took a hair from Reggie's sweater that implied that he sneaked a date with Midge behind Moose's back (the look on both of their faces imply he was on to something). Jughead also stated that he felt naked without a hat. Finally, Veronica gave him a special hat to try on. When he did, everyone said it suited him (it was an ugly thing but looked comical. She said she was saving it for a Mad Hatter party). Jughead tried wearing it for a day at school, but scared several students, teachers, and even Miss Beazly the cafeteria lady) they begged him to go back to his trademark hat. When he asked what they'd do if he did, they offered him a platter of hamburgers and he happily agreed.\n\nIn Jughead and Friends Digest #25 story \"The Secret of Jughead's Hat\" his cap is destroyed in a laundry accident. Wendy Weatherbee (Principal Weatherbee's niece) replaces the lost hat by doing exactly as explained above when she takes an old Fedora and cuts it and shapes it to remake the whoopee cap or crown.\n\n===Family and friends===\nJughead's best friend is [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]], despite their personality difference. Archie was the first person that Jughead met upon moving to Riverdale, and he is often dragged into Archie's schemes and antics. Jughead is usually the first one to bail Archie out of trouble (though some times he only makes things worse). Jughead, extremely loyal, is willing to do almost anything to help his friend, something that Archie occasionally takes for granted.\n\nReggie Mantle is another one of Jughead's close friends, though his and Jughead's relationship is defined by their constant competition. Reggie never loses an opportunity to insult Jughead (\"needle-nose\" being his favorite nickname) and Jughead often responds with tricks to aggravate Reggie. Though it often appears they hate each other, and neither will admit otherwise, they really do care for one another. Jughead will even help Reggie escape being injured when [[Moose Mason]] is angry with him.\n\nAlongside Archie, [[Betty Cooper]] frequently slips into the best friend role for Jughead in the comics. Their mutual love and appreciation for food (she cooks, he eats), and continuously going to bat for each other have made their friendship a stronghold in the comics. While generally disinterested in matters of the heart, Jughead frequently stands up for Betty when Archie breaks her heart. In one comic, Jughead tells Betty that if he were to ever kiss a girl willingly, it would be her.\n\nJughead and [[Veronica Lodge]] are constantly arguing. Veronica cannot stand his laid-back attitude witticisms, and Jughead enjoys teasing her and making her lose her temper with clever insults. Their relationship would be considered that of \"frenemies\". Although at times, he relishes causing her to get angry because sometimes he sees her as an uncaring selfish snob. He once told Veronica he was \"mad with passion\" for her, and began popping up wherever she went, to get her off his back after she criticized him publicly. They were once cast together in a school play, which required them to kiss. Due to the way Jughead kissed her, she was caught up in the moment and fell in love with him for a while. However, Jughead managed to get her over her crush, with the help of a garlic and onion sandwich.<ref>Jughead's Double Digest #99: \"Shakespeare Anyone?\" (January 2004)</ref>\n\nJughead's other friends include [[Dilton Doiley]] and [[Moose Mason]]. Other than Dilton, Jughead probably gets along with Moose better than the other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose's girlfriend [[Midge Klump|Midge]]). Jughead's nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he gets along with Dilton.\n\nJughead's family includes his father, also named Forsythe, his mother Gladys, and in later comics, his younger sister Jellybean. He also has many eccentric relatives including slightly-addled Uncle Herman, or \"Doc Jones\", a daffy and slightly pompous [[inventor]] whose creations usually wreak havoc on Jughead and/or his friends and his lookalike younger cousin, Souphead. Other one-time relatives appear frequently.  Jughead also tells many stories of his ancestors, who prove to be quite as interesting as himself. A 1970s \"Archie\" cartoon episode featured Jughead's paternal grandparents\u2014''both'' of whom resemble Jughead.\n\nAnother acquaintance of Jughead's is Trula Twyst, Riverdale High's budding pop psychologist, who is constantly trying to analyze Jughead to determine what makes him so odd. The two share a strange love/hate relationship that would have gone much smoother had they not met the way they did- Trula tricked Jughead into dating her in order to become more popular.\n\nIn one story, Jughead claimed his great-grandmother was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] \"from the Pawtuxet tribe,\" despite the fact that the [[Patuxet]] were killed off by 1622.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[George Gladir|Gladir, George]] | artist=[[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]|coartists=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | story=Liberty Island | title=Life with Archie | volume=1 | issue=255 | date=July, 1986 | publisher=Archie | location= |page=5 }}</ref> In another story from the same era, he claimed his great-great-grandfather was \"an [[eskimo]],\" who was \"the only cop north of Nome...'Ol' Bluenose Jones' they called him!\" <ref name=\"Giant Box of Comics\">{{cite web|url=http://giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com/2016/05/an-interesting-discovery.html |title=An Interesting Discovery |publisher=giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com |date=2016-05-06 |accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously. In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica, which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes, since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents.\n\nIn the \"Mad Magazine\" universe, Jughead's doppelg\u00e4nger is nicknamed Bottleneck. Bottleneck wears a beanie that resembles a broken bottleneck. His best friend (and fellow juvenile delinquent) is Starchie.<ref>{{cite comic|story=STARCHIE! |title=Mad Magazine|issue=12|date=June 1954|writer=Harvey Kurtzman|artist=Will Elder|pages=1-8}}, reprinted in ''MAD About the Fifties'' (1997), QPB</ref>\n\n===Miniseries===\n[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|''Jughead's Time Police'']] was a series that began in 1990 featuring Jughead as a hero of the 29th century and a member of the Time Police, an organization that ensures history to remain the same for the future's sake.

Jughead's philosophy on romantic relationships, gained from observing Archie's romantic entanglements, is that dating complicates a guy's life and deprives him of cash that could be used to buy burgers. This often attracts girls rather than repels them. His most ardent admirer is [[Ethel Muggs]], an awkward but very friendly girl who chases after Jughead at every opportunity, despite Jughead's constant and blunt refusals.  Later story-lines showed a decrease in her obsession with him, and even show her dating other guys, surprisingly making Jughead jealous. Jughead secretly enjoys the attention, although he claims he puts up with Ethel's company only if she cooks for him. He has shown romantic interest in her on rare occasions, and eventually fell in love with her in the ''Life With Archie: The Married Life'' series where the \"Archie Marries Veronica\" stories ended with Jughead and Ethel's wedding.\n\nIn 2016, Jughead's orientation was confirmed to be [[asexuality|asexual]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/archie-jughead-asexual.html|title=Archie Comic Reveals Jughead Is Asexual|author= Abraham Riesman|date=February 8, 2016|work=Vulture|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> in the stories of Chip Zdarsky (and later Ryan North and Mark Waid) for the ''[[Jughead (comic book)|Jughead]]'' comics as part of the ''[[New Riverdale]]'' line.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chip Zdarsky Opens Up About Jughead|url = http://comicbook.com/2015/09/25/chip-zdarsky-opens-up-about-jughead/|website = Comicbook.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref> Zdarsky said of his run on the book that \"the next writer could make him discover girls or boys or both and that's totally fine.

There has never been one consistent canon explanation for Jughead's avoidance of girls and dating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ArchieComics|title=Archie Comics/Characters|website = TV Tropes}}</ref>  In one story, Jughead declares, \"I don't hate girls\u2014I just love food more!\"<ref>{{cite comic|story=Double Your Pleasure|title=Archie's Pals 'n' Gals|issue=212|date=January 1990}}</ref>  In the story \"Phood Phobia\", Archie and [[Dilton Doiley]] discover a hidden layer to this: it turns out that Jughead is actually nervous around girls, and he turns to food for comfort.  When confronted with this, Jughead is stunned; finding out that girls are the reason he enjoys food so much makes him lose his appetite.  In another story, when Jughead saw that [[Miss Grundy]] was upset on her birthday, he rallied the other students to cheer her up.\n\nIn \"A Lass From The Past\", written by Nate Butler and first appearing in ''Jughead'' #5 (April 1988), Jughead explains the reason he does not chase after girls is because of a childhood heartbreak, sustained before he moved to [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]].  Little Jughead befriended Joani and they had a [[puppy love]] relationship.  Jughead's family moved to Riverdale and he had to leave Joani behind.  Determined to not endure heartbreak again, he swore off girls, keeping little Joani's picture in his wallet as a reminder.  That changed when Debbie moved to town (in \"Jughead's Journal,\" written by Rod Ollerenshaw and also first appearing in Jughead #5), and Jughead began to overcome his old heartbreak as they started dating.  However, Joani suddenly visits town.  Now a young woman, she tells Jughead that she never forgot him and still has a crush on him, and they share their first kiss.  Before Jughead decides whether he wants to pursue a relationship with Joani, she leaves him, but with a promise that they will be together again. The comic even had Jughead say, \"Sometimes, life is just more interesting than burgers and shakes.\"<ref>{{cite comic|title=Jughead Jones Digest Magazine|issue=81|date=April 1993}}</ref>  For a while, Debbie and Joani formed Jughead's own love triangle, but fans did not like it, so both girls disappeared and Jughead reverted to his classic independent lifestyle.  A few years later, a girl named [[List of Archie Comics characters#Trula Twyst|Trula Twyst]] appeared. She tends to drive Jughead crazy with her ability to predict his next moves, and they developed a [[love-hate relationship]].\n\nAnother thread that has run through stories involves a psychic experience he is supposed to have had, caused by an odd pin he wears on his hat.  In the early 1990s, Jughead had three girlfriends: [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Debbie]], [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Joani]], and [[Minor characters in Archie Comics#January McAndrews|January McAndrews]].  The latter is Archie's descendant in the future, who starred with Jughead in [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|Jughead's Time Police]], a short-lived spinoff comic about their adventures traveling through time.\n\n==Musical interests==\nJughead was the [[drummer]] for [[The Archies]]. In one four-part story, which included many flashbacks of Jughead's life, Archie had commented that the reason he'd chosen the position of drummer was that he was too introverted to play at the front of the stage. Another reason was that he could put food in his drums to eat while he played.\n\nHe has also professed a love for [[jazz]] music, once detailed in an issue of ''[[Jughead Magazine]]'' where he develops an obsession with an obscure [[jazz]] [[drum]]mer named \"Crazy\" Willie Jim. After collecting his records, Jughead finally met Jim, who was now very old, ailing and reclusive, playing on a street corner. Jughead convinced Jim that he was trustworthy and they became fast friends. Jim even played with The Archies at one of their gigs. Jim died very soon after, so Jughead sat in with Jim's friends on the corner to play one last, mournful version of \"[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]\".\n\n==Special abilities==\nIn spite of his reputation as slow and lazy, Jughead is frequently shown to be extremely intelligent, and often surprises his skeptical friends (notably [[Reggie Mantle]] and [[Veronica Lodge]]) with his vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, including history, [[Shakespeare]], sports, and science. In several issues, Jughead has demonstrated that his IQ is well above average. He is an extremely good student, which exasperates his teachers when he sometimes pays them no attention.\n\nHis intelligence varies from story to story. In many cases, he has trouble keeping decent grades, but was once given an award for being the best student in the school. Once, in [[Little Archie]], it was revealed that as a student, Jughead was second only to [[Dilton Doiley]]. His intelligence is displayed by his sharp wit, the occasional deep insight, and the odd chance he gets to upstage or outsmart [[Reggie Mantle]]. In one issue, [[Mr. Weatherbee]] tries to cut down on Jughead's food consumption, only to realize that Jughead's brain stops functioning without massive amounts of food. Professor [[Flutesnoot]] implies that Jughead's brain burns all the calories, which keeps him thin.\n\nJughead is also a talented artist, and refers to his works as his \"Dipsy Doodles\", which feature in one-page comic strips. Often, what he paints comes to life or becomes a real, three-dimensional object. Another recurring gag, featured in the 1960s, was \"Professor Jughead\", where he would wear a gown and mortarboard and lecture to his fellow teenagers about subjects he considered relevant. However, the content of the lesson was often nonsensical and useless in real life. ''Professor Jughead's Loony Laws'' was a strip in which he presented various [[dumb laws]].<ref>{{cite comic|date=April 1989|story=Professor Jughead's Loony Laws|title=Jughead|volume=2|issue=11|writer=Rich Margopoulos|artist=Doug Crane|coartists=Jon d'Agostino|ID={{issn|0022-5991}} }}</ref> One strip explores the fact that Jughead is seldom drawn with his eyes open by noting that Jughead has the unusual ability to \"see\" with his eyes completely shut, and not see with them open.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoys playing [[video games]], reading [[comic books]], and [[skateboarding]]. It was also noted in one issue that he has an interest in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] as well, with titles such as [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Lunar]], [[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Tall 33]], [[Robotech|Tech Robo]], and [[Magic Knight Rayearth|Tragic Knight Sayearth]]. In the late 1980s, Jughead became obsessed with the skateboarding subculture, and his interests and taste in fashion were revamped to fit this. A number of short-lived characters were added to the ''Jughead'' comics, including his paraplegic African-American crush [[List of Archie Comics characters#Anita Chavita|Anita]]; blind rival for Ethel's affections [[List of Archie Comics characters#Jeffrey|Jeff]] and his guide dog Spike; and heavy metal band [[List of Archie Comics characters#The Potholes|The Potholes]]. However, this makeover only lasted for a few years.\n\nJughead rarely takes an interest in sports, but has a few unexpected athletic talents. These are often side effects of his other activities. For example, he is a very fast runner due to his constant evasion of [[Ethel Muggs|Ethel]] and his determination to be at the front of the lunchline every day. Coach Kleats often tries to recruit him for various school teams, usually without longterm success. Over the years, he has been seen as a basketball player, baseball pitcher, martial artist, swimmer, dancer and gymnast.\n\nMany stories revolve around other characters making comments about Jughead's appetite. One story has Dilton Doiley making calculations to scientifically prove that it's impossible for Jughead to eat the way that he does, and even convinces Pop Tate to cook everything Jughead ate earlier to prove it. When the entire gang isn't paying attention, Jughead ate all the food and ended the story by saying that if they didn't believe it they could make the food and he'd eat it again. Another story has Jughead going against a guy from another group in an eating contest. The rival gang sends a girl to feed Jughead to fill him up the night before in an effort to cheat but he manages to win anyway. In still another, Archie expresses concern over Jughead's eating and lack of exercise, which prompts Reggie to show off lifting a single crate of Pop's bottles over his head. Jughead helps Pop by effortlessly lifting three crates at once and carrying them to the back room, stunning Archie and Reggie. Unnerving them even more, he rips out a stool that Pop said he could take for a souvenir (he was replacing his counter stools later that day) with one hand again with no effort. In that story, he says he eats to get strong, cracking up Archie and Reggie, but they change their mind when they see he's very strong, and even take up eating in an effort to get strong, with no success.\n\nOften, when Jughead attempts to join a team, he ends up with an undesirable menial task, such as water-boy or equipment manager. However, he often takes part in less strenuous school activities, such as the school newspaper, ''the Blue and Gold''. His reputation as a food critic and his unbiased views of the school teams make him a valuable member of the staff. In some stories, Jughead has been shown to have supernatural abilities that are never seen again. These include controlling weather, giving the evil-eye, learning the skills presented in any book he reads, and predicting the future.\n\nIn the \"[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Super Teens|Super Teens]]\" stories (where several of the main ''Archie'' characters are secretly [[superheroes]]), Jughead could become '''Captain Hero''', gaining a caped costume and more muscular physique (varying from story to story), but retaining his crown-shaped cap. Captain Hero appeared when Jughead recites the magic incantation (similar to [[Green Lantern]]'s oath):\n\n''Teeny weeny magic beanie pointing towards the sky; give me muscle, power, vigor - form a super guy!''\n\nCaptain Hero often seemed to possess just the right powers for the problem at hand. These were never completely defined, but he maintained certain \"stock\" superhuman powers, such as flight, enhanced strength and resistance to injury. Early on, Captain Hero was often the most serious and competent of the Super Teens, and the others would defer to his leadership, in contrast to Jughead's perceived status as Archie's sidekick and a generally lazy individual.\n\n==Hot Dog==\n[[File:Jughd.jpg|thumb|Jughead and Hot Dog]]\nHot Dog is a long-haired [[mixed-breed dog|mutt]] who resembles a white [[Old English Sheepdog]]. He belongs to Jughead, although when he first appeared in ''Pep Comics'' #224 (December 1968), he belonged to Archie. Hot Dog switched owners frequently in his early appearances, but was eventually given a permanent home with Jughead.\n\nHot Dog usually thinks like a [[human]], in that his thoughts are presented in [[thought bubble]]s. He is lazy, constantly hungry, and, much like Jughead, has a dislike for [[Reggie Mantle]].\n\nHot Dog is usually considered a member of [[List of Archie Comics characters#Main characters|Archie's Gang]]. He tends to be attracted to [[Veronica Lodge]]\u2019s pedigreed dogs, and even had a litter of puppies with one of them, a poodle named Lucretia, much to Veronica's chagrin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the 1970s series ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'', Hot Dog has a [[sidekick]], Chili Dog, who is smaller and red-haired. A [[running gag]] is the two dogs' \"battles\" with Sabrina's cat [[Salem Saberhagen]]. In the [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Hot Dog|alternate universe limited series ''Jughead's Pal, Hot Dog'']], when Jughead's family objects to Hot Dog living indoors because he is covered in dirt, [[Dilton Doiley]] builds Hot Dog a [[doghouse]] full of whimsical inventions. Hot Dog's sidekick in that short-lived series is a chihuahua named Pablito.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |title=November \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232609/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== In other media ===\nIn the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[The Archie Show]]'', Hot Dog is the mascot for [[The Archies]] and is often portrayed as pretending to \"conduct\" the band.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Afterlife with Archie''===\nJughead appears in the first issue of ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]'' before being bitten by a resurrected Hot Dog, which transforms him into a zombie. He is referred to as \"Patient Zero\" in terms of being the first one affected. However, the eighth issue reveals that Jughead is a ghost and his soul is no longer in his body; whatever is controlling his corpse isn't him.\n\n===''Jughead: The Hunger''===\nIn this [[Archie Horror]] spin-off, Jughead is a werewolf responsible for a number of murders in Riverdale and becomes known as \"The Riverdale Ripper.\" He and Archie realize he's a werewolf after he murders Dilton during a full moon. The next day, Betty reveals that he comes from a long-line of [[lycanthropy]] dating all the way back to medieval England and that her ancestors have always been there to stop them. Not wanting Betty to murder his friend, Archie suggests going to the botanical gardens to cure Jughead with Wolfsbane. This works for a couple of months, but after it wears off and Jughead murders Reggie in his wolf state, he leaves town with Hot Dog as he knows Betty wouldn't give him a second chance.\n\n===''Life with Archie: The Married Life''===\nJughead appears in ''[[Life with Archie#Volume 2 (The Married Life)|Life with Archie: The Married Life]]'' beginning in 2010. In this series, Jughead has taken over Pop's from Pop Tate and has renamed it Jughead's, which later spanned a franchise in each respective universe.<ref>''Life with Archie: The Married Life'' 1</ref> He ended up abandoning the franchise to operate the original shoppe in Riverdale.

Archie introduced each educational short, like a lesson on the importance of bathing from Nancy and Sluggo.\n* Another show, ''[[The U.S. of Archie]]'', depicted Archie and the gang as themselves in different historical eras. The goal was to teach history.\n* Jughead appeared in ''[[The New Archies]]'', a 1987 re-imagining of Archie and the gang. Jughead was portrayed as a pre-teen in junior high. He was voiced by Michael Fantini. \n* Jughead appeared in ''[[Archie's Weird Mysteries]]'', voiced by Chris Lundquist.\n*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Jughead, Moose, Archie, and Reggie made a cameo beating up [[Homer Simpson]] in \"[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]\".\n\n===Live-action===\n[[File:Cole Sprouse by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Cole Sprouse]] plays Jughead on ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.]]\n* Derrel Maury<ref>{{imdb name|0561278|Derrel Maury}}</ref> played Jughead in \"Archie\", a 1976 episode of the ''ABC Saturday Comedy Special''; this was intended to be the [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a new series, which never materialized.<ref name=Archie76>{{imdb episode|0768855|Archie}}</ref> He reprised this role in the 1978 [[Television film|TV-movie]] ''The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show''.<ref name=Archie78>{{imdb title|1291664|The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show}}</ref>\n* Jughead appears in ''[[Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again]]'', a 1990 TV movie which was broadcast on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]], portrayed by [[Sam Whipple]].

This version of Jughead is markedly different from the comic character, exhibiting a darker, moodier demeanor. In the show, Jughead wears an ordinary dark gray knitted hat with points and pins, but appears in a dream sequence wearing his distinctive crown cap and \"S\" sweatshirt. His mother and sister are mentioned but absent, having left due to his father's drinking. His father, F.P., is leader of the Southside Serpents, and Jughead, choosing not to live with him, is homeless. In the first-season finale, the Serpents offer Jughead one of their jackets, essentially making him an honorary member. In the second season, he undergoes an initiation that includes a brutal beating to become a full-fledged member. Over time, he becomes a de facto leader of the teenagers in the gang, and in the second-season finale, after he attempts to save the Serpents from a fight with a rival gang that badly outnumbers them by trading himself, F.P. retires and names him as his successor.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n===References===\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Hal |authorlink=Hal Erickson (author) |year=2005 |title=Television Cartoon Shows |edition=2nd|volume=1 |publisher=McFardland and Company|isbn=07864-2255-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://archiecomics.com Official website]\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/jughead.htm Archie's Pal, Jughead] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

{"title_page": "Pay-per-click", "text_new": "{{Internet Marketing}}\n'''Pay-per-click''' ('''PPC'''), is an [[internet]] advertising model used to drive traffic to websites, in which an advertiser pays a publisher (typically a [[Web search engine|search engine]], website owner, or a network of websites) when the ad is clicked.\n\nPay-per-click is commonly associated with first-tier search engines (such as  [[Google Ads]], Amazon Advertising and [[Microsoft Advertising]] formerly Bing Ads). With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target market and pay when ads (text based search ads or shopping ads that are a combination of images and text) are clicked. In contrast, content sites commonly charge a fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system. PPC display advertisements, also known as banner ads, are shown on web sites with related content that have agreed to show ads and are typically not pay-per-click advertising. Social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Pinterest]] and [[Twitter]] have also adopted pay-per-click as one of their advertising models.\n\nHowever, websites can offer PPC ads. Websites that utilize PPC ads will display an advertisement when a keyword query matches an advertiser's keyword list that has been added in different ad groups, or when a content site displays relevant content. Such advertisements are called ''sponsored links'' or ''sponsored ads'', and appear adjacent to, above, or beneath organic results on search engine results pages, or anywhere a web developer chooses on a content site.<ref name=customersnow>\"Customers Now\", David Szetela, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe PPC advertising model is open to abuse through [[click fraud]],<ref>Jansen, B. J. (2007) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_click_fraud.pdf Click fraud]. IEEE Computer. 40(7), 85-86.  [[Pennsylvania State University|The Pennsylvania State University]]. ([[PDF]])</ref> although Google and others have implemented automated systems<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/using-data-to-help-prevent-fraud.html|title=Using data to help prevent fraud|author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]|publisher=[[Google Blog]]|date=March 18, 2008|accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref> to guard against abusive clicks by competitors or corrupt [[Web developer|web developers]].<ref>[https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348752?hl=en How Google prevents invalid activity] Google AdSense Help Center, Accessed November 17, 2014</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nPay-per-click, along with [[cost per impression]](CPM) and [[cost per order]], are used to assess the cost-effectiveness and profitability of the internet marketing. Cost Per Thousand Impressions(CPM) will help to reach our brand broadly around google and their connected sites, the advertiser will pay only every 1000 impressions of the ad. Pay-per-click (PPC) has an advantage over cost per impression in that it conveys information about how effective the advertising was. Clicks are a way to measure attention and interest: if the main purpose of an ad is to generate a click, or more specifically drive traffic to a destination, then pay-per-click is the preferred metric. Once a certain number of web impressions are achieved, the quality and placement of the advertisement will affect [[click through rate]]s and the resulting pay-per-click.\n\n[[Google Ads]] can be considered the largest digital advertising platform that uses a CPC pricing model.\n\n==Construction==\n\nCost-per-click (CPC) is calculated by dividing the advertising cost by the number of clicks generated by an advertisement. The basic formula is:\n\n:Cost-per-click ($) = Advertising cost ($) / Ads clicked (#)\n\nThere are two primary models for determining pay-per-click: flat-rate and bid-based. In both cases, the advertiser must consider the potential value of a click from a given source. This value is based on the type of individual the advertiser is expecting to receive as a visitor to his or her website, and what the advertiser can gain from that visit, usually revenue, both in the short term as well as in the long term. As with other forms of advertising, targeting is key, and factors that often play into PPC campaigns include the target's interest (often defined by a search term they have entered into a search engine or the content of a page that they are browsing), intent (e.g., to purchase or not), location (for [[geo targeting]]), and the day and time that they are browsing.\n\n===Flat-rate PPC===\nIn the flat-rate model, the advertiser and publisher agree upon a fixed amount that will be paid for each click. In many cases, the publisher has a rate card that lists the pay-per-click (PPC) within different areas of their website or network. These various amounts are often related to the content on pages, with content that generally attracts more valuable visitors having a higher PPC than content that attracts less valuable visitors. However, in many cases, advertisers can negotiate lower rates, especially when committing to a long-term or high-value contract.\n\nThe flat-rate model is particularly common to [[price comparison service|comparison shopping engines]], which typically publish rate cards.<ref>[https://merchant.shopping.com/enroll/app?service=page/Rate Card Shopping.com Merchant Enrollment] Shopping.com, Accessed June 12, 2007, </ref> However, these rates are sometimes minimal, and advertisers can pay more for greater visibility. These sites are usually neatly compartmentalized into product or service categories, allowing a high degree of targeting by advertisers. In many cases, the entire core content of these sites is paid ads.\n\n===Bid-based PPC===\nThe advertiser signs a contract that allows them to compete against other advertisers in a private auction hosted by a publisher or, more commonly, an [[advertising network]]. Each advertiser informs the host of the maximum amount that he or she is willing to pay for a given ad spot (often based on a [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]), usually using online tools to do so. The auction plays out in an automated fashion every time a visitor triggers the ad spot.\n\nWhen the ad spot is part of a search engine results page ([[Search engine results page|SERP]]), the automated auction takes place whenever a search for the keyword that is being bid upon occurs. All bids for the keyword that target the searcher's Geo-location, the day and time of the search, etc. are then compared and the winner determined. In situations where there are multiple ad spots, a common occurrence on SERPs, there can be multiple winners whose positions on the page are influenced by the amount each has bid. The bid and [[Quality Score]] are used to give each advertiser's advert an ad rank. The ad with the highest ad rank shows up first. The predominant three match types for both Google and Bing are Broad, Exact and Phrase Match. Google Ads and Bing Ads also offer the Broad Match Modifier type which differs from broad match in that the keyword must contain the actual keyword terms in any order and doesn't include relevant variations of the terms.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6324?hl=en |title= Keyword Matching Options Article: Keyword Matching Options Bing Ads |publisher= Google Support |access-date= 26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to ad spots on SERPs, the major advertising networks allow for contextual ads to be placed on the properties of 3rd-parties with whom they have partnered. These publishers sign up to host ads on behalf of the network. In return, they receive a portion of the ad revenue that the network generates, which can be anywhere from 50% to over 80% of the gross revenue paid by advertisers. These properties are often referred to as a ''content network'' and the ads on them as ''[[Contextual advertising|contextual ads]]'' because the ad spots are associated with keywords based on the context of the page on which they are found. In general, ads on content networks have a much lower [[click-through rate]] (CTR) and [[conversion rate]] (CR) than ads found on SERPs and consequently are less highly valued. Content network properties can include websites, newsletters, and e-mails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advertising.yahoo.com/smallbusiness/whatsincluded|title=Sponsored Search|author=[[Yahoo!

It is common practice amongst auction hosts to charge a winning bidder just slightly more (e.g. one penny) than the next highest bidder or the actual amount bid, whichever is lower.<ref>[https://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1704424 The cost of AdWords] Google AdWords Help, Accessed May 18, 2012, </ref> This avoids situations where bidders are constantly adjusting their bids by very small amounts to see if they can still win the auction while paying just a little bit less per click.\n\nIn order to maximize success and achieve scale, automated bid management systems can be deployed. These systems can be used directly by the advertiser, though they are more commonly used by advertising agencies that offer PPC bid management as a service. These tools generally allow for bid management at scale, with thousands or even millions of PPC bids controlled by a highly automated system. The system generally sets each bid based on the goal that has been set for it, such as maximize profit, maximize traffic, get the very targeted customer at break even, and so forth. The system is usually tied into the advertiser's website and fed the results of each click, which then allows it to set bids. The effectiveness of these systems is directly related to the quality and quantity of the performance data that they have to work with \u2014 low-traffic ads can lead to a scarcity of data problem that renders many bid management tools useless at worst, or inefficient at best.\n\nAs a rule, the contextual advertising system (Google AdWords, Yandex.Direct, etc.) uses an auction approach as the advertising payment system.\n\n==History==\n\nThere are several sites that claim to be the first PPC model on the web,<ref>Jansen, B.

([[PDF]])</ref> with many appearing in the mid-1990s. For example, in 1996, the first known and documented version of a PPC was included in a web directory called Planet Oasis. This was a desktop application featuring links to informational and commercial websites, and it was developed by Ark Interface II, a division of [[Packard Bell]] NEC Computers. The initial reactions from commercial companies to Ark Interface II's \"pay-per-visit\" model were skeptical, however.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190108053619/https://adage.com/article/news/interactive-planet-oasis-web-sites-promotion-clout/78467/ Planet Oasis gives web sites promotion clout],  Bradley Johnson, ''[[Ad Age|Advertising Age]]'' July 8, 1996, Retrieved December 5, 2012, </ref> By the end of 1997, over 400 major brands were paying between $.005 to $.25 per click plus a placement fee.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn February 1998 Jeffrey Brewer of [[Yahoo!

It was not until October 2000 that the [[Google Ads|AdWords]] system was introduced, allowing advertisers to create text ads for placement on the Google search engine. However, PPC was only introduced in 2002; until then, advertisements were charged at [[Cost per impression|cost-per-thousand impressions]] or [[Cost per mille]] (CPM). Overture has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Google, saying the rival search service overstepped its bounds with its ad-placement tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-876861.html|title=Overture sues Google over search patent|author=Stefanie Olsen and Gwendolyn Mariano |publisher=[[CNET]]|date=April 5, 2002|accessdate=Jan 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough GoTo.com started PPC in 1998, [[Yahoo!]] did not start syndicating GoTo.com (later Overture) advertisers until November 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release975.html|title=Yahoo! and Overture Extend Pay-for-Performance Search Agreement|author=Yahoo!

The ACCC ruled that Google was responsible for the content of its sponsored AdWords ads that had shown links to a car sales website [[Carsales.com]]. The Ads had been shown by Google in response to a search for [[Honda Australia]]. The ACCC said the ads were deceptive, as they suggested Carsales.com was connected to the Honda company. The ruling was later overturned when Google appealed to the [[Australian High Court]]. Google was found not liable for the misleading advertisements run through AdWords despite the fact that the ads were served up by Google and created using the company's tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/cases/google.html|title=Google Inc vs ACCC|last=|first=|date=|website=australiancontractlaw.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- New links alphabetically -->\n*[[Advertising]]\n*[[Automated bid managers]]\n* [[Clickthrough rate]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Pay-per-call advertising]]\n* [[Pay to click]]\n* [[Search engine marketing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Blog topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pay Per Click}}\n[[Category:Compensation methods]]\n[[Category:Pricing]]\n[[Category:Online advertising methods]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Contexts for auctions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Internet Marketing}}\n'''Pay-per-click''' ('''PPC'''), is an [[internet]] advertising model used to drive traffic to websites, in which an advertiser pays a publisher (typically a [[Web search engine|search engine]], website owner, or a network of websites) when the ad is clicked.\n\nPay-per-click is commonly associated with first-tier search engines (such as  [[Google Ads]], Amazon Advertising and [[Microsoft Advertising]] formerly Bing Ads). With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target market. In contrast, content sites commonly charge a fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system. PPC display advertisements, also known as banner ads, are shown on web sites with related content that have agreed to show ads and are typically not pay-per-click advertising. Social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Pinterest]] and [[Twitter]] have also adopted pay-per-click as one of their advertising models.\n\nHowever, websites can offer PPC ads. Websites that utilize PPC ads will display an advertisement when a keyword query matches an advertiser's keyword list that has been added in different ad groups, or when a content site displays relevant content. Such advertisements are called ''sponsored links'' or ''sponsored ads'', and appear adjacent to, above, or beneath organic results on search engine results pages, or anywhere a web developer chooses on a content site.<ref name=customersnow>\"Customers Now\", David Szetela, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe PPC advertising model is open to abuse through [[click fraud]],<ref>Jansen, B.

Cost Per Thousand Impressions(CPM) will help to reach our brand broadly around google and their connected sites, the advertiser will pay only every 1000 impressions of the ad. Pay-per-click (PPC) has an advantage over cost per impression in that it conveys information about how effective the advertising was. Clicks are a way to measure attention and interest: if the main purpose of an ad is to generate a click, or more specifically drive traffic to a destination, then pay-per-click is the preferred metric. Once a certain number of web impressions are achieved, the quality and placement of the advertisement will affect [[click through rate]]s and the resulting pay-per-click.\n\n[[Google Ads]] can be considered the largest digital advertising platform that uses a CPC pricing model.\n\n==Construction==\n\nCost-per-click (CPC) is calculated by dividing the advertising cost by the number of clicks generated by an advertisement. The basic formula is:\n\n:Cost-per-click ($) = Advertising cost ($) / Ads clicked (#)\n\nThere are two primary models for determining pay-per-click: flat-rate and bid-based. In both cases, the advertiser must consider the potential value of a click from a given source. This value is based on the type of individual the advertiser is expecting to receive as a visitor to his or her website, and what the advertiser can gain from that visit, usually revenue, both in the short term as well as in the long term. As with other forms of advertising, targeting is key, and factors that often play into PPC campaigns include the target's interest (often defined by a search term they have entered into a search engine or the content of a page that they are browsing), intent (e.g., to purchase or not), location (for [[geo targeting]]), and the day and time that they are browsing.\n\n===Flat-rate PPC===\nIn the flat-rate model, the advertiser and publisher agree upon a fixed amount that will be paid for each click. In many cases, the publisher has a rate card that lists the pay-per-click (PPC) within different areas of their website or network. These various amounts are often related to the content on pages, with content that generally attracts more valuable visitors having a higher PPC than content that attracts less valuable visitors. However, in many cases, advertisers can negotiate lower rates, especially when committing to a long-term or high-value contract.\n\nThe flat-rate model is particularly common to [[price comparison service|comparison shopping engines]], which typically publish rate cards.<ref>[https://merchant.shopping.com/enroll/app?service=page/Rate Card Shopping.com Merchant Enrollment] Shopping.com, Accessed June 12, 2007, </ref> However, these rates are sometimes minimal, and advertisers can pay more for greater visibility. These sites are usually neatly compartmentalized into product or service categories, allowing a high degree of targeting by advertisers. In many cases, the entire core content of these sites is paid ads.\n\n===Bid-based PPC===\nThe advertiser signs a contract that allows them to compete against other advertisers in a private auction hosted by a publisher or, more commonly, an [[advertising network]]. Each advertiser informs the host of the maximum amount that he or she is willing to pay for a given ad spot (often based on a [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]), usually using online tools to do so. The auction plays out in an automated fashion every time a visitor triggers the ad spot.\n\nWhen the ad spot is part of a search engine results page ([[Search engine results page|SERP]]), the automated auction takes place whenever a search for the keyword that is being bid upon occurs. All bids for the keyword that target the searcher's Geo-location, the day and time of the search, etc. are then compared and the winner determined. In situations where there are multiple ad spots, a common occurrence on SERPs, there can be multiple winners whose positions on the page are influenced by the amount each has bid. The bid and [[Quality Score]] are used to give each advertiser's advert an ad rank. The ad with the highest ad rank shows up first. The predominant three match types for both Google and Bing are Broad, Exact and Phrase Match. Google also offers the Broad Match Modifier type which differs from broad match in that the keyword must contain the actual keyword terms in any order and doesn't include relevant variations of the terms.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6324?hl=en |title= Keyword Matching Options Article: Keyword Matching Options Bing Ads |publisher= Google Support |access-date= 26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to ad spots on SERPs, the major advertising networks allow for contextual ads to be placed on the properties of 3rd-parties with whom they have partnered. These publishers sign up to host ads on behalf of the network. In return, they receive a portion of the ad revenue that the network generates, which can be anywhere from 50% to over 80% of the gross revenue paid by advertisers. These properties are often referred to as a ''content network'' and the ads on them as ''[[Contextual advertising|contextual ads]]'' because the ad spots are associated with keywords based on the context of the page on which they are found. In general, ads on content networks have a much lower [[click-through rate]] (CTR) and [[conversion rate]] (CR) than ads found on SERPs and consequently are less highly valued. Content network properties can include websites, newsletters, and e-mails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advertising.yahoo.com/smallbusiness/whatsincluded|title=Sponsored Search|author=[[Yahoo!

It is common practice amongst auction hosts to charge a winning bidder just slightly more (e.g. one penny) than the next highest bidder or the actual amount bid, whichever is lower.<ref>[https://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1704424 The cost of AdWords] Google AdWords Help, Accessed May 18, 2012, </ref> This avoids situations where bidders are constantly adjusting their bids by very small amounts to see if they can still win the auction while paying just a little bit less per click.\n\nIn order to maximize success and achieve scale, automated bid management systems can be deployed. These systems can be used directly by the advertiser, though they are more commonly used by advertising agencies that offer PPC bid management as a service. These tools generally allow for bid management at scale, with thousands or even millions of PPC bids controlled by a highly automated system. The system generally sets each bid based on the goal that has been set for it, such as maximize profit, maximize traffic, get the very targeted customer at break even, and so forth. The system is usually tied into the advertiser's website and fed the results of each click, which then allows it to set bids. The effectiveness of these systems is directly related to the quality and quantity of the performance data that they have to work with \u2014 low-traffic ads can lead to a scarcity of data problem that renders many bid management tools useless at worst, or inefficient at best.\n\nAs a rule, the contextual advertising system (Google AdWords, Yandex.Direct, etc.) uses an auction approach as the advertising payment system.\n\n==History==\n\nThere are several sites that claim to be the first PPC model on the web,<ref>Jansen, B.

([[PDF]])</ref> with many appearing in the mid-1990s. For example, in 1996, the first known and documented version of a PPC was included in a web directory called Planet Oasis. This was a desktop application featuring links to informational and commercial websites, and it was developed by Ark Interface II, a division of [[Packard Bell]] NEC Computers. The initial reactions from commercial companies to Ark Interface II's \"pay-per-visit\" model were skeptical, however.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190108053619/https://adage.com/article/news/interactive-planet-oasis-web-sites-promotion-clout/78467/ Planet Oasis gives web sites promotion clout],  Bradley Johnson, ''[[Ad Age|Advertising Age]]'' July 8, 1996, Retrieved December 5, 2012, </ref> By the end of 1997, over 400 major brands were paying between $.005 to $.25 per click plus a placement fee.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn February 1998 Jeffrey Brewer of [[Yahoo!

It was not until October 2000 that the [[Google Ads|AdWords]] system was introduced, allowing advertisers to create text ads for placement on the Google search engine. However, PPC was only introduced in 2002; until then, advertisements were charged at [[Cost per impression|cost-per-thousand impressions]] or [[Cost per mille]] (CPM).
