He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at [[West Kildonan Collegiate]]. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either \"flunked or dropped out and came back\", and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had \"discipline and determination\" because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his \"lack of studiousness\", and finished his schooling at [[Garden City Collegiate]]. He went on to study business administration at what is now [[Red River College]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mbteach.org/extras/teacher%20appreciation/randy%20bachman.html|title=randy bachman|publisher=The Manitoba Teachers' Society|date=January 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Profession musical career==\n===The Guess Who===\nIn 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to record and tour until the end of the decade, after Randy agreed to sell the rights to the \"BTO\" name to the remaining band members.\n\n===1979-1981===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other parts of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After BTO broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988, Bachman-Turner Overdrive had reformed again, this time with the popular 1974-77 lineup. The band toured together until 1991, when Randy again departed. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]]. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called \"Every Song Tells A Story\", where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] performed throughout Canada as [[Bachman & Cummings (band)|Bachman & Cummings]] in the summer of 2006, while on tour with [[The Carpet Frogs]]. Bachman and Fred Turner completed a new [[Bachman & Turner]] album that was released in September 2010. The album's single titled \"Rollin' Along\", was released in June 2010 on iTunes. The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010\u201311) under their Bachman & Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Later in March 2018, Randy Bachman released a tribute to George Harrison containing cover version of the latter's hits. The album featured one original song titled \"Between Two Mountains\", and also featured [[Walter Trout]] on  the album's version of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\n==Guitar style==\nBachman has stated that his guitar sound was influenced by his early violin studies, saying \"when I wanted to play a rock solo, I played like it was violin...

He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at [[West Kildonan Collegiate]]. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either \"flunked or dropped out and came back\", and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had \"discipline and determination\" because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his \"lack of studiousness\", and finished his schooling at [[Garden City Collegiate]]. He went on to study business administration at what is now [[Red River College]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mbteach.org/extras/teacher%20appreciation/randy%20bachman.html|title=randy bachman|publisher=The Manitoba Teachers' Society|date=January 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Profession musical career==\n===The Guess Who===\nIn 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to record and tour until the end of the decade, after Randy agreed to sell the rights to the \"BTO\" name to the remaining band members.\n\n===1979-1981===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other parts of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After BTO broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988, Bachman-Turner Overdrive reformed with the popular 1974-77 lineup, and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]]. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called \"Every Song Tells A Story\", where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] performed throughout Canada as [[Bachman & Cummings (band)|Bachman & Cummings]] in the summer of 2006, while on tour with [[The Carpet Frogs]].

The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010\u201311) under their Bachman & Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

He is the current manager of [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].\n\nHarris is Millwall's [[Millwall F.C.#Player records|all-time record goalscorer]], with 138 goals in all competitions. He broke the previous record of 111 goals, held by [[Teddy Sheringham]], on 13 January 2009, during a 3\u20132 away win at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]. He has made the fourth most appearances for the club, with 432. He also played for [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]], [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. Harris retired from professional football in June 2013 and took up a coaching role at Millwall. Having briefly acted as caretaker-manager after the dismissal of [[Steve Lomas]] in January 2014, Harris was given the same role following the dismissal of [[Ian Holloway]] in March 2015 and was confirmed as permanent manager of Millwall on 29 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millwallfc.co.uk/news/article/neil-harris-appointed-millwall-manager-2430301.aspx |title=Neil Harris appointed Millwall manager |website=Millwallfc.co.uk |date=2015-04-29 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career and Millwall===\nHarris was born in [[Orsett]], Essex,<ref name=\"Hugman2010-11\"/> and educated at [[Brentwood School, Essex|Brentwood School]]. One of his earliest clubs was [[Maldon Town F.C.|Maldon Town]] but his real football career began when he signed for [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]]. In December 1997 he had a trial at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/football-this-weeks-transfers-1288569.html\n|title=Football: This Week's Transfers\n|publisher=Independent\n|date=13 December 1997\n|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> however this didn't lead to a transfer. He was later sold to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] for a fee of \u00a330,000 on 25 March 1998. In his first full season, he was named player of the year for Millwall and later helped them to a Second Division championship in 2000\u201301 with a remarkable goal scoring record. Harris was the Golden Boot winner for being the top English goal scorer during the 2000\u201301 season, earning him the nickname of \"Bomber\", in reference to [[Arthur Travers Harris]]. Neil Harris was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in 2001, but after receiving intensive treatment including surgery, he was given the all clear a year later. As a consequence he set up a cancer charity, the ''Neil Harris Everyman Appeal''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/millwall/1668736.stm \"Harris launches cancer appeal\"], [[BBC Sport]], 22 November 2001</ref> By the end of his first spell at Millwall, Harris was not being played because the then [[player-manager]] [[Dennis Wise]] did not believe he was up to par, and that led him to sign for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on [[loan (association football)|loan]] to prove he was good enough for first team football at Millwall.\n\nHarris made his debut for Cardiff City when he replaced [[Cameron Jerome]] during a 3\u20131 win over [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and, after one more substitute appearance, was handed his first and only start for Cardiff when manager [[Lennie Lawrence]] named him to play against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and he repaid the faith shown in him by scoring Cardiff's only goal of the game in a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4087895.stm\n|title=Sheff Utd 2\u20131 Cardiff\n|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]\n|date=18 December 2004\n|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\nCardiff City and Harris could not agree terms and he was subsequently sold to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for an undisclosed fee after they were relegated to [[Football League One]] in the 2004\u201305 season.\n\nHarris was unable to make an impact at the [[City Ground]] so was loaned out to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] who had also been [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to League One at the same time as Nottingham Forest. He scored six goals for Gillingham during his season long loan spell, at the end of which he returned to Forest.\n\nHarris was hoping to make an impact under new manager [[Colin Calderwood]]. Harris's old club Millwall made a loan deal for him on a six-month deal in August 2006, however Harris rejected the offer saying if he were to move it would have to be on a permanent basis, and with [[Darren Byfield]] and [[Ben May]] set to return from injury for Millwall, Harris believed he would have once again been forced out the side, which was the reason he left [[The Den]] in the first instance. Millwall therefore, withdrew from transfer negotiations.\n\nHarris finally opened his goal-scoring account for Forest on 2 September 2006, after 21 months of waiting in a 4\u20130 victory against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/5288444.stm\n|title=Nottm Forest 4\u20130 Chesterfield\n|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]\n|date=2 September 2006\n|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> It was a cutely struck volley from a few yards out. His and his teammates' joy was clear to see in his celebration, as he ran towards the corner of the stadium and did not look as though he would stop, until his teammates caught up. In the post match report, he admitted he was finally enjoying life at Nottingham Forest. Nonetheless, a certain contingent of the Forest fans still criticised Harris for his relatively poor scoring record and somewhat poor performance record.\n\nIn January 2007 Harris' contract was terminated by mutual consent.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Return to Millwall===\nHarris re-signed with Millwall on an 18-month contract on 8 January 2007, less than 24 hours after leaving Forest. Speaking to [[BBC Sport]] the next day Harris stated, \"There is something special about this club, it brings out the best in me as a player and a person. It feels like home, it always has done. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nOn 20 January 2007, in his second game for Millwall, Harris made club history by scoring in the 16th minute of the 4\u20130 win over [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]] to become Millwall's top league goal scorer with 94 goals, surpassing the previous club record of 93 goals he had jointly held with [[Teddy Sheringham]]. Harris informed the ''[[South London Press]]'', on 23 January, that it was his intention to surpass Sheringham's 111 goal total for Millwall, stating: \"There is no question of me relaxing after one goal. At last I can say, without putting too much pressure on myself, that I want Teddy's overall record. The thing I've always wanted is to be number one, and that means getting a total of 112.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n[[File:Ian Tomlinson just before he was struck.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Ian Tomlinson]] wearing a \"Neil Harris all-time leading goal scorer\" T-shirt over a Millwall top, shortly before his death during the 2009 [[2009 G-20 London summit protests|G-20 summit protests]].]]\n\nTowards the end of the 2007\u201308 season, as the club were mired in a relegation battle, Millwall boss [[Kenny Jackett]] told Harris that his contract would not be renewed in the summer as he was not in his first team plans for the following season; younger players such as [[Lewis Grabban]], [[Gary Alexander (footballer)|Gary Alexander]], [[Bas Savage]] and [[Marc Laird]] had pushed him down the pecking order. Harris responded by stating that he had no intention of leaving the club he loved in its hour of need. Jackett brought Harris back into the first team squad on 15 March 2008, due to an injury to Gary Alexander that kept him out for the remainder of the season. Harris was instrumental in securing Millwall's League One status, scoring one goal and turning provider for the other two in Millwall's 3\u20130 home win over [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on 26 April.

He is the current manager of [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].\n\nHarris is Millwall's [[Millwall F.C.#Player records|all-time record goalscorer]], with 138 goals in all competitions. He broke the previous record of 111 goals, held by [[Teddy Sheringham]], on 13 January 2009, during a 3\u20132 away win at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]. He has made the fourth most appearances for the club, with 432. He also played for [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]], [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. Harris retired from professional football in June 2013 and took up a coaching role at Millwall. Having briefly acted as caretaker-manager after the dismissal of [[Steve Lomas]] in January 2014, Harris was given the same role following the dismissal of [[Ian Holloway]] in March 2015 and was confirmed as permanent manager of Millwall on 29 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millwallfc.co.uk/news/article/neil-harris-appointed-millwall-manager-2430301.aspx |title=Neil Harris appointed Millwall manager |website=Millwallfc.co.uk |date=2015-04-29 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career and Millwall===\nHarris was born in [[Orsett]], Essex,<ref name=\"Hugman2010-11\"/> and educated at [[Brentwood School, Essex|Brentwood School]]. One of his earliest clubs was [[Maldon Town F.C.|Maldon Town]] but his real football career began when he signed for [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]]. In December 1997 he had a trial at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/football-this-weeks-transfers-1288569.html\n|title=Football: This Week's Transfers\n|publisher=Independent\n|date=13 December 1997\n|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> however this didn't lead to a transfer. He was later sold to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] for a fee of \u00a330,000 on 25 March 1998. In his first full season, he was named player of the year for Millwall and later helped them to a Second Division championship in 2000\u201301 with a remarkable goal scoring record. Harris was the Golden Boot winner for being the top English goal scorer during the 2000\u201301 season, earning him the nickname of \"Bomber\", in reference to [[Arthur Travers Harris]]. Neil Harris was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in 2001, but after receiving intensive treatment including surgery, he was given the all clear a year later. As a consequence he set up a cancer charity, the ''Neil Harris Everyman Appeal''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/millwall/1668736.stm \"Harris launches cancer appeal\"], [[BBC Sport]], 22 November 2001</ref> By the end of his first spell at Millwall, Harris was not being played because the then [[player-manager]] [[Dennis Wise]] did not believe he was up to par, and that led him to sign for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on [[loan (association football)|loan]] to prove he was good enough for first team football at Millwall.\n\nHarris made his debut for Cardiff City when he replaced [[Cameron Jerome]] during a 3\u20131 win over [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and, after one more substitute appearance, was handed his first and only start for Cardiff when manager [[Lennie Lawrence]] named him to play against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and he repaid the faith shown in him by scoring Cardiff's only goal of the game in a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4087895.stm\n|title=Sheff Utd 2\u20131 Cardiff\n|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]\n|date=18 December 2004\n|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\nCardiff City and Harris could not agree terms and he was subsequently sold to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for an undisclosed fee after they were relegated to [[Football League One]] in the 2004\u201305 season.\n\nHarris was unable to make an impact at the [[City Ground]] so was loaned out to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] who had also been [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to League One at the same time as Nottingham Forest. He scored six goals for Gillingham during his season long loan spell, at the end of which he returned to Forest.\n\nHarris was hoping to make an impact under new manager [[Colin Calderwood]]. Harris's old club Millwall made a loan deal for him on a six-month deal in August 2006, however Harris rejected the offer saying if he were to move it would have to be on a permanent basis, and with [[Darren Byfield]] and [[Ben May]] set to return from injury for Millwall, Harris believed he would have once again been forced out the side, which was the reason he left [[The Den]] in the first instance. Millwall therefore, withdrew from transfer negotiations.\n\nHarris finally opened his goal-scoring account for Forest on 2 September 2006, after 21 months of waiting in a 4\u20130 victory against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/5288444.stm\n|title=Nottm Forest 4\u20130 Chesterfield\n|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]\n|date=2 September 2006\n|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> It was a cutely struck volley from a few yards out. His and his teammates' joy was clear to see in his celebration, as he ran towards the corner of the stadium and did not look as though he would stop, until his teammates caught up. In the post match report, he admitted he was finally enjoying life at Nottingham Forest. Nonetheless, a certain contingent of the Forest fans still criticised Harris for his relatively poor scoring record and somewhat poor performance record.\n\nIn January 2007 Harris' contract was terminated by mutual consent.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Return to Millwall===\nHarris re-signed with Millwall on an 18-month contract on 8 January 2007, less than 24 hours after leaving Forest. Speaking to [[BBC Sport]] the next day Harris stated, \"There is something special about this club, it brings out the best in me as a player and a person. It feels like home, it always has done. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nOn 20 January 2007, in his second game for Millwall, Harris made club history by scoring in the 16th minute of the 4\u20130 win over [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]] to become Millwall's top league goal scorer with 94 goals, surpassing the previous club record of 93 goals he had jointly held with [[Teddy Sheringham]]. Harris informed the ''[[South London Press]]'', on 23 January, that it was his intention to surpass Sheringham's 111 goal total for Millwall, stating: \"There is no question of me relaxing after one goal. At last I can say, without putting too much pressure on myself, that I want Teddy's overall record. The thing I've always wanted is to be number one, and that means getting a total of 112.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n[[File:Ian Tomlinson just before he was struck.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Ian Tomlinson]] wearing a \"Neil Harris all-time leading goal scorer\" T-shirt over a Millwall top, shortly before his death during the 2009 [[2009 G-20 London summit protests|G-20 summit protests]].]]\n\nTowards the end of the 2007\u201308 season, as the club were mired in a relegation battle, Millwall boss [[Kenny Jackett]] told Harris that his contract would not be renewed in the summer as he was not in his first team plans for the following season; younger players such as [[Lewis Grabban]], [[Gary Alexander (footballer)|Gary Alexander]], [[Bas Savage]] and [[Marc Laird]] had pushed him down the pecking order. Harris responded by stating that he had no intention of leaving the club he loved in its hour of need. Jackett brought Harris back into the first team squad on 15 March 2008, due to an injury to Gary Alexander that kept him out for the remainder of the season. Harris was instrumental in securing Millwall's League One status, scoring one goal and turning provider for the other two in Millwall's 3\u20130 home win over [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on 26 April.

On July 8, 1944 the first truck [[ZIS-5 (truck)|ZIS-5]]V was built under the brand UralZIS. The new factory became the Ural branch of ZIS UralZIS. At the end of the war, the ZIS-5 was considered simple and robust, and thus remained in production for many years. It was not until 1947 that the factory started to manufacture updated models.\n\nIn 1946, the production version of the gas-21A UralZIS 2.5t began fabrication. The truck was produced under the brand UralZIS-352. In 1949, the 5th version of UralZIS was equipped with [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] brakes.\n\nA new model, the UralZIS-355, was released in 1956. However, in 1958, the new version of the [[ZiS-5 (truck)|ZIS-5]] was made available for deliveries to Kazakhstan and remained in production until October 16, 1963 as an AMO-3 bypass [[Fiat]].\n\nThe Scientific Institute of Automotive Standardization of Moscow had been working on a new SUV. Production of this type of truck had been assigned to the Ural factory&nbsp;\u2013 UralAZ&nbsp;\u2013 who got the brand new Ural. The factory had been rebuilt since 1961 and production of the Ural-375 (6x6) 5 t for the army was intensified. For this truck, a new engine was developed.\n\nThe 1960s were a period of great success for the brand UralAZ which won, for its quality products in large quantities, the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]. UralAZ celebrated the total production of 530,000 trucks and 1.3 mln engines. In 1972 and 1975 the two vehicles appeared Ural-375H-377H and the Ural. The manufacture of 6x4 versions continued until 1983.\n\nIn 1977, a new 5-tonne truck Ural-4320 was created. [[Kamaz|KamAZ]] petrol engine replaced the Ural-375-740 V8 diesel KamAZ (10852&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, 210HP). In 1981, based on a 4320 model truck 8 t the Ural-5920 was presented with a Caterpillar engine.\n\nIn 1987, UralAZ celebrated its millionth truck. Governmental industry reorganization and economic reforms forced UralAZ to become a private limited company and turn to the production of civilian vehicles. The models 43204 and 55571 emerged due to this.\n\nSince June 1992 production of 6 t truck Ural-4322 (6x6) started with a new more contemporary cabin. It was equipped with the Ural-744 air cooled V8 engine with an output of 234 HP, diesel Kustanay (KDZ), a manufacturer of [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engines under license.\n\nA fire occurred in the spring of 1993 at the KamAZ engine plant that seriously disrupted production. As a result, the company had to look for engine suppliers.\n\nUralAZ was traditionally oriented only to Russian companies, but began a collaboration with the Italian manufacturer [[Iveco]] in 1992 (see \u201cIveco-UralAZ collaboration\u201d). The first result of this joint venture model was presented in May of that year, which was the UralAZ-330-18t Iveco 30ANW (6x6) with a 306 HP, air-cooled diesel engine. Its Iveco chassis is imported.\n\nThe creation of the JV-UralAZ IVECO in 1994 allowed the small series production of the range of previously imported heavy trucks. The production of advanced [[Iveco|IVECO]] cabins began in 1997.\n\nUralAZ, like all Russian manufacturers, traditionally maintains a wide range for military off-road drive permanent. Besides the military versions of 43,206 trucks (4x4) and 4320-31 (6x6), UralAZ continuous production of 9 t trucks Ural-5323 (8x8).\n\nSince 1997, military vehicles also provide the basis for civilian versions \u2013 universal frame of 15-t 53236 for the installation of special equipment. The truck 5323-22 (8x8) has cabins and advanced IVECO IVECO engine with two berths.\n\nThat same year the 6301 chassis (6x6) with the same cabin was presented with a payload of 10 t. As desired by the buyer, it is possible to install a V6 diesel engine Deutz liquid cooled with a capacity of 272,240 HP, the KamAZ-740.et gearboxes UralAZ, Eaton and Fuller.\n\nCurrently, the future of UralAZ is closely related to the creation of new models. UralAZ has a production capacity of 30,000 trucks. Dependent of the evolution of the Russian market, production was reduced to 7,000, then to 5,400. In 1998, UralAZ sold only 2,489 chassis and the factory filed for [[bankruptcy]].\n\n===Iveco-UralAZ collaboration ===\nCollaboration between UralAZ and [[IVECO]] began in 1992. In May the first result of joint activity was represented: the Iveco UralAZ 330-30ANW (6x6) with a gross weight of 33.5 ton. It has a diesel air-cooled 306&nbsp;hp V8 engine [[Deutz AG|Deutz]]. The vehicle was designed for arctic climate that could reach up to -55&nbsp;\u00b0C. The contribution of the Russian partner has been limited. The new vehicle replaces the [[Magirus-Deutz]]-2900-26K, developed in the 70s under the brand IVECO-Magirus and whose production was stopped in Europe many years ago. This became the basis of the production range of the new joint venture.\n\nIveco-UralAZ formed in late 1994 with a production capacity of 3600 vehicles per year. All production features badge IVECO-UralAZ on the front grille. However, in the technical press Russian vehicles are frequently called Ural-Iveco.\nThe first truck is the cab-IVECO-UralAZ 5531, closely derived from the Iveco 330. Its composition allows for a road train of 60 t, as well as the tractor-trailer and truck 55311 6x4 or 6x6..\n\nIn 1997, a new cab appeared called the 6329, it had several standard sizes [[Iveco Trakker|EuroTrakker]]. It replaced the old cab Fiat VI. The cabin is further forward on the chassis. The short version of the car is used on trucks and semitrailer truck for local transport. The 63291 has the main tractor cabin with two berths. The PTR of the entire road is 56 t with a maximum speed of 103&nbsp;km/h. Annual production was increased to 9000. IVECO EuroTech is no longer manufactured in Western Europe.In 2008, the ownership structure evolved and t [[Iveco]] became the majority owner. The General Meeting of April 7, 2009 decided to name the new company \"Iveco-UralAZ\" (Ru:\u0423\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0437-\u0418\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e) which was renamed \"[[Iveco-AMT]]\" (Ru:\u0418\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e-\u0410\u041c\u0422) in April 16, 2009.\n\nIveco-AMT introduced brand new trucks named [[Iveco Trakker]]. \"AMT\" means: Automobile / HAI M / Turin. This is based on the locations of the two plants. The assembly is performed in the city of Miass, Chelyabinsk region, and component production takes place in Turin.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Ural Next flatbed truck\u21162.jpg|thumb|Ural NEXT]]\nIn 2015 production of a brand new truck began, the cabine of the new [[Ural Next]] unified with [[GAZ Gazelle NEXT]] LCV. The engine has increased power (312&nbsp;hp). AWD system management became electro-pneumatic push-button. The lighting equipment uses LEDs. The instrument panel is an LCD display, and there is the USB-port. The basic package includes: electric power windows, central door lock with remote control, audio system with control buttons on the steering wheel, exterior mirrors with heating, air suspended driver's seat, heated fuel filter and fuel in-line, adjustable height steering wheel, and on-board computer. Additional optional equipment includes ABS, air conditioning, locking of differential, auxiliary fuel tank, engine block heater, and a set of door pockets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ural ladder

On July 8, 1944 the first truck [[ZIS-5 (truck)|ZIS-5]]V was built under the brand UralZIS. The new factory became the Ural branch of ZIS UralZIS. At the end of the war, the ZIS-5 was considered simple and robust, and thus remained in production for many years. It was not until 1947 that the factory started to manufacture updated models.\n\nIn 1946, the production version of the gas-21A UralZIS 2.5t began fabrication. The truck was produced under the brand UralZIS-352. In 1949, the 5th version of UralZIS was equipped with hydraulic brakes.\n\nA new model, the UralZIS-355, was released in 1956. However, in 1958, the new version of the [[ZiS-5 (truck)|ZIS-5]] was made available for deliveries to Kazakhstan and remained in production until October 16, 1963 as an AMO-3 bypass [[Fiat]].\n\nThe Scientific Institute of Automotive Standardization of Moscow had been working on a new SUV. Production of this type of truck had been assigned to the Ural factory&nbsp;\u2013 UralAZ&nbsp;\u2013 who got the brand new Ural. The factory had been rebuilt since 1961 and production of the Ural-375 (6x6) 5 t for the army was intensified. For this truck, a new engine was developed.\n\nThe 1960s were a period of great success for the brand UralAZ which won, for its quality products in large quantities, the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]. UralAZ celebrated the total production of 530,000 trucks and 1.3 mln engines. In 1972 and 1975 the two vehicles appeared Ural-375H-377H and the Ural. The manufacture of 6x4 versions continued until 1983.\n\nIn 1977, a new 5-tonne truck Ural-4320 was created. [[Kamaz|KamAZ]] petrol engine replaced the Ural-375-740 V8 diesel KamAZ (10852&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, 210HP). In 1981, based on a 4320 model truck 8 t the Ural-5920 was presented with a Caterpillar engine.\n\nIn 1987, UralAZ celebrated its millionth truck. Governmental industry reorganization and economic reforms forced UralAZ to become a private limited company and turn to the production of civilian vehicles. The models 43204 and 55571 emerged due to this.\n\nSince June 1992 production of 6 t truck Ural-4322 (6x6) started with a new more contemporary cabin. It was equipped with the Ural-744 air cooled V8 engine with an output of 234 HP, diesel Kustanay (KDZ), a manufacturer of [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engines under license.\n\nA fire occurred in the spring of 1993 at the KamAZ engine plant that seriously disrupted production. As a result, the company had to look for engine suppliers.\n\nUralAZ was traditionally oriented only to Russian companies, but began a collaboration with the Italian manufacturer [[Iveco]] in 1992 (see \u201cIveco-UralAZ collaboration\u201d). The first result of this joint venture model was presented in May of that year, which was the UralAZ-330-18t Iveco 30ANW (6x6) with a 306 HP, air-cooled diesel engine. Its Iveco chassis is imported.\n\nThe creation of the JV-UralAZ IVECO in 1994 allowed the small series production of the range of previously imported heavy trucks. The production of advanced IVECO cabins began in 1997.\n\nUralAZ, like all Russian manufacturers, traditionally maintains a wide range for military off-road drive permanent. Besides the military versions of 43,206 trucks (4x4) and 4320-31 (6x6), UralAZ continuous production of 9 t trucks Ural-5323 (8x8).\n\nSince 1997, military vehicles also provide the basis for civilian versions \u2013 universal frame of 15-t 53236 for the installation of special equipment. The truck 5323-22 (8x8) has cabins and advanced IVECO IVECO engine with two berths.\n\nThat same year the 6301 chassis (6x6) with the same cabin was presented with a payload of 10 t. As desired by the buyer, it is possible to install a V6 diesel engine Deutz liquid cooled with a capacity of 272,240 HP, the KamAZ-740.et gearboxes UralAZ, Eaton and Fuller.\n\nCurrently, the future of UralAZ is closely related to the creation of new models. UralAZ has a production capacity of 30,000 trucks. Dependent of the evolution of the Russian market, production was reduced to 7,000, then to 5,400. In 1998, UralAZ sold only 2,489 chassis and the factory filed for bankruptcy.\n\n===Iveco-UralAZ collaboration ===\nCollaboration between UralAZ and [[IVECO]] began in 1992. In May the first result of joint activity was represented: the Iveco UralAZ 330-30ANW (6x6) with a gross weight of 33.5 ton. It has a diesel air-cooled 306&nbsp;hp V8 engine [[Deutz AG|Deutz]]. The vehicle was designed for arctic climate that could reach up to -55&nbsp;\u00b0C. The contribution of the Russian partner has been limited. The new vehicle replaces the [[Magirus-Deutz]]-2900-26K, developed in the 70s under the brand IVECO-Magirus and whose production was stopped in Europe many years ago. This became the basis of the production range of the new joint venture.\n\nIveco-UralAZ formed in late 1994 with a production capacity of 3600 vehicles per year.

[[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]], a historic suburb named after the French navigator [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]] (1741\u201388), is notable for its old military outpost at [[Bare Island (New South Wales)|Bare Island]] and the [[Botany Bay National Park]].\n\nThe suburb of [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] in [[southern Sydney]] is close to [[Royal National Park]], Australia's oldest national park.

This area includes suburbs in the [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of [[Hornsby Shire]], [[City of Ryde]], the [[Municipality of Hunter's Hill]] and parts of the [[City of Parramatta]].\n\nThe [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], an informal geographic term referring to the northern metropolitan area of Sydney, consists of {{NSWcity|Artarmon}}, {{NSWcity|Chatswood}}, {{NSWcity|Roseville}}, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}, [[Killara]], {{NSWcity|Gordon}}, {{NSWcity|Pymble}}, {{NSWcity|Hornsby}} and many others.\n\nThe Lower North Shore usually refers to the suburbs adjacent to the harbour such as {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}, {{NSWcity|Waverton}}, [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], {{NSWcity|Cremorne}}, [[Cremorne Point]], {{NSWcity|Lavender Bay}}, [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]], {{NSWcity|Cammeray}}, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]], and North Sydney. {{NSWcity|Hunters Hill}} and {{NSWcity|Gladesville}} are often also considered as being part of the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Liveable Sydney: The lower north shore's suburbs ranked by liveability|url=https://www.domain.com.au/news/liveable-sydney-lower-north-shore-ranked|date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The Lower North Shore's eastern boundary is [[Middle Harbour]], or at the [[Roseville Bridge]] at {{NSWcity|Castle Cove}} and {{NSWcity|Roseville Chase}}. The Upper North Shore usually refers to the suburbs between {{NSWcity|Chatswood}} and {{NSWcity|Hornsby}}. It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous and variable. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.

The [[Cumberland Plain]] lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew. It was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated. [[Beaches in Sydney|Seventy beaches]] can be found along its coastline with Bondi Beach being one of the most famous.\n\nThe [[Nepean River]] wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching [[Broken Bay]]. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The [[Parramatta River]] is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson.

It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]].

For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.

The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is elected to a four-year term, and responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many [[Government agency|agencies]] of the [[Government of Indiana|Indiana state government]]. The governor also shares power with other statewide [[Executive (government)|executive]] officers, who manage other [[State governments of the United States|state government]] agencies. The governor works out of the [[Indiana Statehouse]] and holds official functions at the [[Indiana Governor's Residence]] in the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] of [[Indianapolis]].\n\nThe 51st, and current, governor is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Eric Holcomb]], who took office on January 9, 2017.\n\nThe position of governor has developed over the course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and [[Indiana Supreme Court]] to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their [[Governor (United States)|counterparts in most other states]].\n\n==Office==\n\n===Authority===\n[[File:Entrance to the office of the Governor of Indiana, Indiana Statehouse, Indianapolis, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the governor's office]]\nThe governor's powers are established in Article V of the [[Constitution of Indiana]]. Constitutionally, the governor has very limited executive authority to manage the government of the state; most exercisable powers over state agencies are held by independent elected cabinet heads.\n\nThe governor works in concert with the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] (the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Indiana General Assembly]], consisting of the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] and the [[Indiana Senate]]) and the [[state supreme court]] (the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]) to govern the state. The governor has the power to [[veto]] [[legislation]] passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration.

The first capital was in [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]], and the first three governors maintained homes and offices there. The capital was moved to Indianapolis in December 1824. Governors originally served three-years terms until the constitution was replaced in 1851. The 1851 constitution extended terms to four years but banned governors from serving consecutive terms. The constitution was amended again in 1972 to allow governors to serve consecutive terms but limited them to two consecutive terms at a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst.txt|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF INDIANA|publisher=Indiana University School of Law&nbsp;\u2014 Bloomington|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref>\n\nThere have been 51 Governors of Indiana. 23 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 21 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have each held the position. Four have died while in office; seven have resigned. Ten Lieutenant Governors have succeeded to become governor. [[James B. Ray]] has been the only President of the Senate ''pro tempore'' to assume the office of governor.\n\nJonathan Jennings was the first Governor to have an attempted impeachment brought against him in response to his actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped.<ref>Woollen, p. 37</ref> The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor [[James B. Ray]] for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28\u201330.<ref>Woolen, p. 61</ref>\n\nFour Governors were elected Vice President of the United States, two while in office.\n\n===Power shifts===\nHistorically, the office of Indiana's governor has been a weaker institution relative to the other branches of state government and also when compared to the role of governors of other U.S. states.<ref name = g1n2/> During Indiana's territorial period, there was a considerable resentment to the power wielded by the territorial governors, and in response the anti-governor faction, which dominated the constitutional convention, created a weak executive position. The governor was not given complete authority over the militia, his term was set at three years, and most of his actions could be overridden by the General Assembly.<ref name = g1n2/> The position was steadily weakened by the legislature, and his power was limited further by the constitution of 1851. The governor's authority to choose his own appointments for the state courts was removed, and the ability to appoint his own cabinet was ended. The cabinet was effectively made independent by making them elected popularly. The authority to propose budgets was revoked, and serving consecutive terms was banned. By comparison, the Supreme Court was made almost entirely independent, and the General Assembly assumed many of the powers taken from the governor.<ref name = g1n2>Gugin, pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Hazard Perry Morton - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|Governor of [[Indiana during the American Civil War]], [[Oliver P. Morton]]]]\n\nGovernors first began to assert their own power during the [[American Civil War]] as the General Assembly attempted to remove command of the militia from the governor.<ref name = g3/> In response, the [[Indiana in the American Civil War|General Assembly was effectively suppressed]], during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers.<ref name = g3/> In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.<ref name = g3>Gugin, p. 3</ref>\n\nWith the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the governors again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor's control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of [[patronage]] positions.<ref name = g3/> The legislature responded by trying to create a [[merit system]] for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies.<ref name = g4/> The battle with the governor continued until 1941, when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Tucker v. State]]''. The court ruled for the first time that the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.<ref name = g4/>\n\nDuring the 1970s, a series of amendments was passed under popular governors that also increased their powers. The state courts were again made appointive, but selection of the candidates was granted to the court-dominated [[Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission]]. However, the governor was given more control over the process in which he previously had none. Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms, allowing Indiana's first consecutive term governors in over one hundred years.<ref name = g4>Gugin, p. 4</ref> A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency, which was run by officials appointed by the governor. The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the \"greatest transfer of power\" to the governor yet, according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin.<ref name = g5>Gugin, p. 5</ref>\n\nDespite gaining considerable power during the mid twentieth-century, Indiana's governor remains fairly weak compared to his counterparts in other states. He has no [[line-item veto]] authority, and the [[pocket veto]] was ruled unconstitutional.<ref name = g5/> If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically.<ref name = g5/> This led to a fist fight during the term of [[Claude Matthews]], who was locked out of the House chambers to prevent him from returning a bill in time.<ref>Gugin, p. 207</ref> The legislature can override a veto with a simple majority, as opposed to a [[supermajority]] that is required federally and in most other states. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the [[Indiana State Police]] and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are under the control of the cabinet.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\">Gugin, p. 6</ref>\n\n===Veto usage===\n\nDuring the state's early history, vetoes were seldom employed by governors primarily because they were seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> Governor [[James Whitcomb]] was the first to make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> [[Roger Branigin]], who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/>\n\n===General Assembly relations===\n\n[[File:Joseph A Wright Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Governor [[Joseph A. Wright]] had a bitter fight with the [[Indiana General Assembly|General Assembly]] over the [[Bank of Indiana]].]]\n\nThe governor's relationship with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power at a time in which his party controlled the assembly.<ref>Gugin, p. 7</ref> Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.<ref>Gugin, p. 8</ref>\n\nGovernors who had previously been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor.<ref name = g10/> Governor [[Joseph A. Wright]] had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the [[Bank of Indiana]]. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.<ref name = g10>Gugin, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Traits===\n\nExcept for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana's governors have been married at the time of their election. Whitcomb married while in office.<ref>Gugin, p. 29</ref> About half of the governors have been married multiple times, all due to the death of their first wives. Three governors' wives, including Whitcomb's, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings and [[Thomas R. Marshall]], all of the state governors have also had children. After leaving office, Marshall adopted a young boy.<ref name = g11>Gugin, p. 11</ref> Only twenty of Indiana's governors were native to the state. Seven were born in [[Pennsylvania]], four born in [[Ohio]], and four born in [[Kentucky]]. Other governors have come from [[Michigan]], [[Virginia]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name = g15>Gugin, p. 15</ref>\n\nTerritorial Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] was appointed to office at age twenty-seven, making him the youngest executive. James B. Ray, elevated at thirty-one and reelected at thirty-two, was the youngest governor to be elected to office. [[Evan Bayh]], at age thirty-four, is the only other governor under the age of forty to be elected. [[James D. Williams]], at age sixty-nine, was oldest governor to be elected and died in office at age seventy-two. The average age of governors at the time of their election is fifty.<ref name = g11/>\n\nThirty-two of Indiana's governors have served in the military. Veteran organizations have served as a gateway for the governorship. [[Ira J. Chase]] served as leader of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Paul V. McNutt, [[Ralph F. Gates]], and [[George N. Craig]] were leaders of the [[American Legion]], whose national headquarters is in Indianapolis.<ref name = g11/>  Thirty governors have been lawyers by profession, and three have been farmers. Thirty received a college education, with eleven of them having attended [[Indiana University]]. Several governors have gone on to higher office, with nine serving in the [[United States Senate]], and three serving as [[Vice President of the United States]].<ref name = g11/>\n\n==Gubernatorial elections==\n{{main|Governor of Indiana elections}}\n{{ElectionsIN}}\n\nUnder the original constitution  of 1816, the state held gubernatorial elections every three years. The first election was held before statehood was approved, in August 1816. Until the constitution was replaced in 1851, elections were held in October, and winners took office in December.<ref name = g1n2/> In 1851, Indiana adopted its second and current constitution, which banned governors from serving consecutive terms and lengthened terms to four years. Elections since then have been held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] in November during years divisible by four, concurrent with presidential elections.<ref name = g1n2/> In 1972, the constitution was amended to allow governors to immediately succeed themselves.<ref name = g1n2/> As mentioned above, the amendment limited a governor to a total of eight years in office during a 12-year period, effectively limiting him to two consecutive terms.\n\n{{Portal|Indiana}}\n\n==References==\n'''Specific'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|publisher=Congressional Quarterly Inc|year=1976|isbn=0-87187-072-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/congres_con_1975_00_9697}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Gugin, Linda C.|editor2=St. Clair, James E|title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780871951960}}\n* {{cite book|author=Indiana Chamber|title=Here's Your Indiana Government|year=2007|publisher=Indiana Chamber of Commerce|isbn=978-1-883698-79-9|url=https://archive.org/details/hereisyourindian00indi}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC|title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana|author=Woollen, William Wesley|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1975|isbn=0-405-06896-4}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.in.gov/gov/ The Office of the Governor of Indiana]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Indiana government}}\n{{Governors of Indiana}}\n{{US Chief Executives}}\n{{Current U.S. governors}}\n{{Indiana}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Governor Of Indiana}}\n[[Category:State constitutional officers of Indiana]]\n[[Category:Governors of Indiana|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American politician}}\n{{For|a list|List of governors of Indiana}}\n{{Infobox official post\n|post            = Governor\n|body            = Indiana\n|insignia        = Indiana-StateSeal.svg\n|insigniasize    = 110px\n|insigniacaption = [[Seal of Indiana|Seal of the State of Indiana]]\n|image           = Holcomb Official Headshot (49639997842).jpg\n|incumbent       = [[Eric Holcomb]]\n|incumbentsince  = January 9, 2017\n|style           =\n|termlength      = Four years, renewable once in a 12-year period\n|residence=[[Indiana Governor's Residence]]\n|inaugural       = [[Jonathan Jennings]]\n|formation       = November 7, 1816\n|deputy          = [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana]]\n|salary          = $111,688 (2015)<ref name=\"The Council of State Governments\">{{cite web | url=http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/system/files/FF_Governors%27_Salaries_2015.pdf | title=Governors' Salaries, 2015 | publisher=The Council of State Governments | date=21 September 2015 | accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref>\n|website         = [http://www.in.gov/gov/ in.gov/gov]\n}}\n\nThe '''Governor of Indiana''' is the [[Head of government]] and [[Head of State]] of the [[Indiana|state of Indiana]]. The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is elected to a four-year term, and responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many [[Government agency|agencies]] of the [[Government of Indiana|Indiana state government]]. The governor also shares power with other statewide [[Executive (government)|executive]] officers, who manage other [[State governments of the United States|state government]] agencies. The governor works out of the [[Indiana Statehouse]] and holds official functions at the [[Indiana Governor's Residence]] in the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] of [[Indianapolis]].\n\nThe 51st, and current, governor is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Eric Holcomb]], who took office on January 9, 2017.\n\nThe position of governor has developed over the course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and [[Indiana Supreme Court]] to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their [[Governor (United States)|counterparts in most other states]].\n\n==Office==\n\n===Authority===\n[[File:Entrance to the office of the Governor of Indiana, Indiana Statehouse, Indianapolis, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the governor's office]]\nThe governor's powers are established in Article V of the [[Constitution of Indiana]].

The governor has the power to [[veto]] [[legislation]] passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration.

Ray]] has been the only President of the Senate ''pro tempore'' to assume the office of governor.\n\nJonathan Jennings was the first Governor to have an attempted impeachment brought against him in response to his actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped.<ref>Woollen, p. 37</ref> The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor [[James B. Ray]] for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28\u201330.<ref>Woolen, p. 61</ref>\n\nFour Governors were elected Vice President of the United States, two while in office.\n\n===Power shifts===\nHistorically, the office of Indiana's Governor has been a weaker institution relative to the other branches of state government and also when compared to the role of governors of other U.S. states.<ref name = g1n2/> During Indiana's territorial period, there was a considerable resentment to the power wielded by the territorial governors, and in response the anti-governor faction, which dominated the constitutional convention, created a weak executive position. The governor was not given complete authority over the militia, his term was set at three years, and most of his actions could be overridden by the General Assembly.<ref name = g1n2/> The position was steadily weakened by the legislature, and his power was limited further by the constitution of 1851. The governor's authority to choose his own appointments for the state courts was removed, and the ability to appoint his own cabinet was ended. The cabinet was effectively made independent by making them elected popularly. The authority to propose budgets was revoked, and serving consecutive terms was banned. By comparison, the Supreme Court was made almost entirely independent, and the General Assembly assumed many of the powers taken from the governor.<ref name = g1n2>Gugin, pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Hazard Perry Morton - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|Governor of [[Indiana during the American Civil War]], [[Oliver P. Morton]]]]\n\nGovernors first began to assert their own power during the [[American Civil War]] as the General Assembly attempted to remove command of the militia from the governor.<ref name = g3/> In response, the [[Indiana in the American Civil War|General Assembly was effectively suppressed]], during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers.<ref name = g3/> In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.<ref name = g3>Gugin, p. 3</ref>\n\nWith the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the governors again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor's control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of [[patronage]] positions.<ref name = g3/> The legislature responded by trying to create a [[merit system]] for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies.<ref name = g4/> The battle with the governor continued until 1941, when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Tucker v. State]]''. The court ruled for the first time that the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.<ref name = g4/>\n\nDuring the 1970s, a series of amendments was passed under popular governors that also increased their powers. The state courts were again made appointive, but selection of the candidates was granted to the court-dominated [[Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission]]. However, the governor was given more control over the process in which he previously had none. Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms, allowing Indiana's first consecutive term governors in over one hundred years.<ref name = g4>Gugin, p. 4</ref> A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency, which was run by officials appointed by the governor. The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the \"greatest transfer of power\" to the governor yet, according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin.<ref name = g5>Gugin, p. 5</ref>\n\nDespite gaining considerable power during the mid twentieth-century, Indiana's governor remains fairly weak compared to his counterparts in other states. He has no [[line-item veto]] authority, and the [[pocket veto]] was ruled unconstitutional.<ref name = g5/> If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically.<ref name = g5/> This led to a fist fight during the term of [[Claude Matthews]], who was locked out of the House chambers to prevent him from returning a bill in time.<ref>Gugin, p. 207</ref> The legislature can override a veto with a simple majority, as opposed to a [[supermajority]] that is required federally and in most other states. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the [[Indiana State Police]] and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are under the control of the cabinet.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\">Gugin, p. 6</ref>\n\n===Veto usage===\n\nDuring the state's early history, vetoes were seldom employed by governors primarily because they were seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> Governor [[James Whitcomb]] was the first to make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> [[Roger Branigin]], who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/> Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.<ref name=\"Gugin, p. 6\"/>\n\n===General Assembly relations===\n\n[[File:Joseph A Wright Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Governor [[Joseph A. Wright]] had a bitter fight with the [[Indiana General Assembly|General Assembly]] over the [[Bank of Indiana]].]]\n\nThe governor's relationship with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power at a time in which his party controlled the assembly.<ref>Gugin, p. 7</ref> Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.<ref>Gugin, p. 8</ref>\n\nGovernors who had previously been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor.<ref name = g10/> Governor [[Joseph A. Wright]] had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the [[Bank of Indiana]]. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.<ref name = g10>Gugin, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Traits===\n\nExcept for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana's governors have been married at the time of their election. Whitcomb married while in office.<ref>Gugin, p. 29</ref> About half of the governors have been married multiple times, all due to the death of their first wives. Three governors' wives, including Whitcomb's, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings and [[Thomas R. Marshall]], all of the state governors have also had children. After leaving office, Marshall adopted a young boy.<ref name = g11>Gugin, p. 11</ref> Only twenty of Indiana's governors were native to the state. Seven were born in [[Pennsylvania]], four born in [[Ohio]], and four born in [[Kentucky]]. Other governors have come from [[Michigan]], [[Virginia]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name = g15>Gugin, p. 15</ref>\n\nTerritorial Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] was appointed to office at age twenty-seven, making him the youngest executive. James B. Ray, elevated at thirty-one and reelected at thirty-two, was the youngest governor to be elected to office. [[Evan Bayh]], at age thirty-four, is the only other governor under the age of forty to be elected. [[James D. Williams]], at age sixty-nine, was oldest governor to be elected and died in office at age seventy-two. The average age of governors at the time of their election is fifty.<ref name = g11/>\n\nThirty-two of Indiana's governors have served in the military. Veteran organizations have served as a gateway for the governorship. [[Ira J. Chase]] served as leader of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Paul V. McNutt, [[Ralph F. Gates]], and [[George N. Craig]] were leaders of the [[American Legion]], whose national headquarters is in Indianapolis.<ref name = g11/>  Thirty governors have been lawyers by profession, and three have been farmers. Thirty received a college education, with eleven of them having attended [[Indiana University]]. Several governors have gone on to higher office, with nine serving in the [[United States Senate]], and three serving as [[Vice President of the United States]].<ref name = g11/>\n\n==Gubernatorial elections==\n{{main|Governor of Indiana elections}}\n{{ElectionsIN}}\n\nUnder the original constitution  of 1816, the state held gubernatorial elections every three years. The first election was held before statehood was approved, in August 1816. Until the constitution was replaced in 1851, elections were held in October, and winners took office in December.<ref name = g1n2/> In 1851, Indiana adopted its second and current constitution, which banned governors from serving consecutive terms and lengthened terms to four years. Elections since then have been held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] in November during years divisible by four, concurrent with presidential elections.<ref name = g1n2/> In 1972, the constitution was amended to allow governors to immediately succeed themselves.<ref name = g1n2/> As mentioned above, the amendment limited a governor to a total of eight years in office during a 12-year period, effectively limiting him to two consecutive terms.\n\n{{Portal|Indiana}}\n\n==References==\n'''Specific'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|publisher=Congressional Quarterly Inc|year=1976|isbn=0-87187-072-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/congres_con_1975_00_9697}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Gugin, Linda C.|editor2=St. Clair, James E|title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780871951960}}\n* {{cite book|author=Indiana Chamber|title=Here's Your Indiana Government|year=2007|publisher=Indiana Chamber of Commerce|isbn=978-1-883698-79-9|url=https://archive.org/details/hereisyourindian00indi}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC|title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana|author=Woollen, William Wesley|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1975|isbn=0-405-06896-4}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.in.gov/gov/ The Office of the Governor of Indiana]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Indiana government}}\n{{Governors of Indiana}}\n{{US Chief Executives}}\n{{Current U.S. governors}}\n{{Indiana}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Governor Of Indiana}}\n[[Category:State constitutional officers of Indiana]]\n[[Category:Governors of Indiana|*]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePower shifts:replaced: Governor \u2192 governor", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Indiana"}

She recalls that she lost her virginity when she was 15 with her classmate, Edouard. Even though she didn't feel anything in her first time, she wanted to have sex again and asks Edouard to have sex with her another hundred times. Afterwards, she continues to have several sexual partners including Alex and Hassan. She continues to have sexual relationships with Alex knowing that he has a girlfriend. Tired of Val's voracious sexual appetite, Alex asks her, \"Are you always thinking about sex?\" and breaks off with her angrily after a night of wild love making. Val is deeply affected by not having anyone to have sex with. So, she goes to a train station, finds a stranger and has sex with him in the empty station.\n\nVal is also disturbed by her excessive sexual appetite and feels that she's not a normal woman. She discusses her sexual life openly with her grandmother who encourages her to do what she loves to do. She also encourages Val to keep a diary of her life as it helps to get a clarity of thoughts. Val asks her grandmother about her sexual life. Her grandmother replies that in those days, you were either somebody's wife or a prostitute and she had no other choice other than marrying Val's grandfather and complains that she was never satisfied by him in bed. When Val asks her if she was given another chance, she would choose to marry him again and her grandmother replies, \"hell, no, I'd go on finding as many sexual partners as I can\".\n\nVal works in marketing department for a firm in Barcelona and when her old friend, Hassan, visits Barcelona, she quits work early and meets him in her house. They have a wild night having sex, trying different things and Val shows up late for work the following day. Val's friend and co-worker, Sonia, warns her to be careful as they do restructuring in her company and she could get fired for showing up late for work. While Sonia, ([[Llum Barrera]]) is interested in finding the right man to get married, have children and start her family, Val is more interested in finding new sexual partners and continues to live a free spirited life.\n\nVery soon, Val gets fired from her job and attends a couple of interviews. In the second interview, the interviewer, Jaime, ([[Leonardo Sbaraglia]]) is very much attracted to Val and asks her out. She immediately accepts. Jaime drives a Jaguar, seems to be a very successful director-general of a company and seems to be very busy. Val likes him and wants to marry him and against her usual self, chooses not to sleep with him after the first date. Jaime immediately buys an expensive home for them to live though Val is worried about his extravagant lifestyle. Val discusses with Sonia about Jaime and Sonia asks about Jaime being older for her as Val is only 29 and Jaime has a couple of grown up children. But, Val is so into Jaime and doesn't take these things seriously. In the meantime, Val visits her grandmother who is ill and during her visit, her grandmother dies, but before her death, she reminds Val to live her life. \"The term, nymphomaniac was invented by men to control women\", she tells her granddaughter.\n\nVal and Jaime move in and start to live together. When they sleep together for the first time, Jaime is finished in two seconds and even though Val is very disappointed about Jaime's performance in bed, she doesn't take it seriously. She tells Sonia that it's all about love and not sex. When Hassan visits Barcelona again and wants to see Val, she refuses to sleep with him and tells him that she has been taken. She also gets a job from her first interview and starts working. However, soon Val realizes that Jaime is bipolar. Some times, he acts very affectionately towards her and other times, he abuses her. Once Jaime enters into her office unannounced and accuses her boss of sleeping with his wife. The next day, he apologizes to Val and asks for forgiveness. But, another day, he brings a prostitute to their house and asks Val to join them. He doesn't even have money to pay for the prostitute and Val ends up paying. Val decides that she can't live with him anymore and decides to move out of their house. When Sonia and Val are preparing her stuff to leave, Jaime shows up and threatens to assault her. They manage to leave and go to Sonia's house.\n\nOne day, Sonia realizes that Val left her house without informing her and so, Sonia tracks her down to a small and somewhat broken-down apartment. Having lost all her savings to pay for Jaime's extravagant lifestyle and without a job, Val feels depressed and tries to jump down from her apartment to take her own life, but, somehow decides not to commit suicide. Desperate for a job and money, Val decides to work for a brothel as a prostitute. In the brothel, the madam controls all the women working for her. There Val meets a Brazilian woman, Cindy, who works for the same brothel and they become close. Cindy tells Val that her son is the most important thing for her in this world and he lives with her mom in Brazil as she doesn't want him to grow up with his father. \n\nVal starts to enjoy her work and soon gets her regular customers including Pedro and an Italian, named Giovanni. She falls in love with Giovanni and he gives her his ring as a reminder that he would come see her again. When he books her again, Val gets excited, but, when she goes to see his hotel suite, he has decided to give her to his friend. Val is once again deeply disappointed by another man. Pedro, her another customer, keeps on telling her that he loves her and wants to marry her. But, he tries to control her by his money and asks her to do things that she doesn't want to do and when they have sex, he hurts her physically. Without bothering to collect her money, Val runs away from his hotel suite. When she returns to the brothel the following day, Cindy kills herself by jumping out from a window.\n\nVal starts to evaluate her life and asks herself if this is what she wants to do. She quickly decides this is not her life and informs the madam that she wants to leave the brothel. Though the madam tries to convince her to stay and then, abuses her and threatens her, Val is determined and leaves the brothel.\n\nDuring rain, she goes to Sonia's house where she meets Sonia, happily married to a guy and informs her that she has left the brothel. Sonia is very happy for Val. When Val returns to her apartment, she sees a guy living in her apartment building who she noticed peeping on her earlier. She asks him if he wants to go to her place. He replies that he doesn't have any money for which she says, 'That's okay, it's not necessary,' indicating that she has resorted to her old way of free-spirited living.<ref>From [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0552772720 the description of the book] at Amazon USA</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bel\u00e9n Fabra]] as Val\n* [[Leonardo Sbaraglia]] as Jaime\n* [[\u00c1ngela Molina]] as Cristina\n* Llum Barrera as Sonia\n* [[Antonio Garrido (actor)|Antonio Garrido]] as Giovanni\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Abuela (Grandmother)\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe movie received mixed reviews.

[It] is marked by an overtly formulaic script, which too neatly follows the three-act structure with a pattern of introduction, elation, conflict, descent and recovery. The film\u2019s pacing problems are exacerbated by a profusion of abbreviated, deficient scenes which interrupt the flow of the narrative.
