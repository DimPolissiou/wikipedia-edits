He was baptised on 6 September 1610. He was educated at Shenley, Hertfordshire, Aughton, Yorkshire and St Peter's, York before attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1627. He was a student of [[Gray's Inn]] in  1630.<ref name=HOP>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/robinson-luke-1610-69  History of Parliament Online - Robinson, Luke]</ref>\n\nRobinson was elected MP for [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] in 1645, taking the place of a member who had been expelled for his [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] sympathies, and sat for the town through the remainder of the [[Long Parliament]], being an active member of the [[Rump Parliament|Rump]] after [[Pride's Purge]], and also served as Bailiff of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] in 1652. He subsequently represented [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] in the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|Second]] and [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]] in the [[Third Protectorate Parliament|Third]] Parliaments of the Protectorate, before resuming his seat for Scarborough when the Rump was reinstated in 1659. He was elected a member of the [[English Council of State|Council of State]] in 1649, 1650 and 1659.\n\nIn January 1660, Robinson was chosen (together with [[Thomas Scot]], the Secretary of State) as the Rump's emissary to the advancing [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]. Their ostensible purpose was to convey congratulations and expressions of good will, but in fact Parliament clearly intended them both to spy on him and if possible to hinder him from any course of action except that which would help the Rump's survival. (At this stage it was not clear that Monck was contemplating the restoration of the [[Charles II of England|King]].) Scot and Robinson met Monck outside [[Leicester]]. Thereafter they dogged his footsteps, insisting on being quartered at the same inn as Monck at every town. At [[Harborough]], they intercepted the delegation sent by the City of London and insisted on answering it on Monck's behalf; at [[St Albans]] Monck discovered they had bored a hole in the wall so they could spy on him from their own quarters. When Monck entered London on 3 February 1660, Scot and Robinson rode with him at the head of his troops as visible demonstration that he derived his authority to act only from Parliament. But their efforts were in vain and Monck was undeterred from following his own course of action. Later the same month, both Scot and Robinson lost their seats on the Council of State.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Robinson was elected once more to represent Scarborough in the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]]. On 1 May 1660, the King's letter containing the [[Declaration of Breda]] was read out in the House of Commons, and the previously republican Robinson apparently underwent a dramatic conversion to the Royal cause; he was first to speak after the letter was read, and did so ''\"bathed in tears\"''. (The incident is recorded by [[Samuel Pepys]] in his diary the following day: ''\"Luke Robinson himself stood up and made a recantation for what he had done, and promises to be a loyal subject to his Prince for the time to come.\"'') Nevertheless, Robinson was soon after expelled from the Commons, by order of the House on 21 June 1660. The House of Commons Journals record no reason for the expulsion, but it seems reasonable to assume that his record during the Commonwealth was considered unacceptable. He apparently took no further part in public life before his death in 1669.\n\nRobinson was clearly a figure well-known and disliked by the Royalists, and he was one of a number of Roundhead figures mocked in a popular Cavalier song of the period:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Luke Robinson shall go before ye, <br/>that snarling northern tyke; <br/>Be sure he\u2019ll not adore ye, <br/>for honour he doth not like; <br/>He cannot honour inherit, <br/>and he knows he can never merit,<br/> And therefore he cannot bear it <br/>that any one else should wear it. <br/><br/>Sing hi ho, envious lown, <br/>you're of the beagle's kind, <br/>Who always bark'd at the moon, <br/>because in the dark it shined. <br/>Sing hi ho, etc.''\n</blockquote>\n\nand another popular ballad of the period described him:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Luke Robinson, that clownado,<br/>Though his heart be a granado,<br/>Yet a high shoe with his hand in his poke<br/>Is his most perfect shadow.''\n</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* ''Cobbett's Parliamentary history of England, from the Norman Conquest in 1066 to the year 1803'' (London: Thomas Hansard, 1808) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150904125310/http://www2.odl.ox.ac.uk/gsdl/cgi-bin/library?e=p-000-00---0modhis06--00-0-0-0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about---00001-001-1-1isoZz-8859Zz-1-0&a=d&cl=CL1]\n* Thomas Hinderwell, ''The history and antiquities of Scarborough and the vicinity'' (2nd edition, York: Thomas Wilson & Son, 1811) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3bkHAAAAQAAJ&dq=members+of+parliament+for+scarborough&pg=PA130&ots=HU7ZVmhHRn&sig=uyvpfh5SJ3ZaPpz1JORpZe1PzCg&prev=http://www.google.co.uk/search%3Fq%3Dmembers%2Bof%2Bparliament%2Bfor%2Bscarborough%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&sa=X&oi=print&ct=result&cd=1&cad=legacy#PPA147,M1]\n* Charles Mackay (ed), ''The Cavalier Songs and Ballads of England from 1642 to 1684'' [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=1030 Project Gutenberg]\n* Patrick Morrah, ''1660: The Year of Restoration'' (London: Chatto & Windus, 1960)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Luke}}\n[[Category:1610 births]]\n[[Category:1669 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of England for constituencies in Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Borough of Scarborough]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Members of Gray's Inn]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1640\u20131648]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1648\u20131653]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1656\u20131658]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1659]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1660]]\n[[Category:People educated at St Peter's School, York]]\n", "text_old": "{{other people|Luke Robinson}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2017}}\n'''Luke Robinson''' (''c.'' 1610&ndash;1669), of Riseborough, was an English [[Member of Parliament]] and of the [[English Council of State|Council of State]] during the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period.\n\nRobinson was the eldest son of Sir Arthur Robinson of Deighton, Northallerton, Yorkshire and his first wife Elizabeth Walthall, daughter of William Walthall  mercer of London.

This marked the end of Swedish rule in North America.\n\nBeginning in 1664 [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] began; after a series of wars between the [[Anglo\u2013Dutch Wars|Dutch and English]], the area stabilized under British rule, with strong influences from the [[Quaker]] communities under the auspices of [[Proprietor]] [[William Penn]].

Delaware, though officially remaining a member of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], was a [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] and divided in its support of both the Confederate and the Union causes. The war created enormous demand for goods and materials supplied by Wilmington including ships, railroad cars, gunpowder, shoes, and other war-related goods.\n\nBy 1868, Wilmington was producing more iron ships than the rest of the country combined and it rated first in the production of gunpowder and second in carriages and leather. Due to the prosperity Wilmington enjoyed during the war, city merchants and manufacturers expanded Wilmington's residential boundaries westward in the form of large homes along tree-lined streets. This movement was spurred by the first horsecar line, which was initiated in 1864 along Delaware Avenue.\n\n[[File:Wilmington, Del. (2674627824).jpg|thumb|right|Map of Wilmington, Delaware, 1874]]\n\nThe late 19th century saw the development of the city's first comprehensive park system. [[William Poole Bancroft]], a successful Wilmington businessman influenced by the work of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], led the effort to establish open parkland in Wilmington. [[Rockford Park]] and [[Brandywine Park]] were created due to Bancroft's efforts.\n\nBoth World Wars stimulated the city's industries. Industries vital to the war effort \u2013 shipyards, steel foundries, machinery, and chemical producers \u2013 operated around the clock. Other industries produced such goods as automobiles, leather products, and clothing. In desperate need of workers more and more minorities moved to the north and settled in places like Wilmington. This led to tensions that occasionally boiled over like the [[Wilmington, Delaware race riot of 1919]].\n\nThe post-war prosperity again pushed residential development further out of the city. In the 1950s, more people began living in the suburbs of North Wilmington and commuting into the city to work. This was made possible by extensive upgrades to area roads and highways and through the construction of [[Interstate 95]], which cut through several of Wilmington's neighborhoods and accelerated the city's population decline. Urban renewal projects in the 1950s and 1960s cleared entire blocks of housing in the Center City and East Side areas.\n\nRiots and civil unrest in the city followed the 1968 assassination of Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] On April 9, 1968, Governor [[Charles L. Terry, Jr.]] deployed the [[Delaware Army National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[Delaware State Police]] to the city at the request of Mayor John Babiarz. Babiarz asked Terry to withdraw the National Guard the following week, but the governor kept them in the city until his term ended in January 1969. This is reportedly the longest occupation of an American city by state forces in the nation's history.<ref name=\"Boyer\">{{Citation |last=Boyer |first=William W. |title=Governing Delaware: Policy Problems In The First State |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA57 |format=eBook |page=57 |chapter=Chapter Three: The Governor as Leader |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Delaware Press]] (eBook: Google) |location=Newark, Delaware |isbn=0-87413-721-7 |oclc=609154858 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&lpg=PA57&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606212918/http://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA57 |archive-date=June 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, job growth and office construction were spurred by the arrival of national banks and financial institutions in the wake of the 1981 Financial Center Development Act, which liberalized the laws governing banks operating within the state, and similar laws in 1986. Today, many national and international banks, including [[Bank of America]], [[Capital One]], [[JPMorgan Chase & Co.|Chase]], and [[Barclays]], have operations in the city, typically credit card operations.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Wilmington aerial.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Wilmington]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.0|mi2|km2}}.

Wilmington is served by [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Delaware)|I-495]] within city limits. In addition, the twin-span [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], a few miles south of the city, provides direct highway access between Delaware and New Jersey, carrying the [[Interstate 295 (Delaware)|I-295]] eastern bypass route around Wilmington and Philadelphia, as well as [[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|US 40]], which continues eastward to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].\n\nThese transportation links and geographic proximity give Wilmington some of the characteristics of a [[satellite city]] to Philadelphia, but Wilmington's long history as Delaware's principal city, its urban core, and its independent value as a business destination makes it more properly considered a small but independent city in the Philadelphia [[metropolitan area]].\n\nWilmington lies along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] geological transition from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Mid-Atlantic Piedmont Plateau]] to the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]]. East of Market Street, and along both sides of the Christina River, the Coastal Plain land is flat, low-lying, and in places marshy. The Delaware River here is an [[estuary]] at sea level (with twice-daily high and low tides), providing [[sea level|sea-level]] access for ocean-going ships.\n\nOn the western side of Market Street, the Piedmont topography is rocky and hilly, rising to a point that marks the watershed between the Brandywine River and the Christina River. This watershed line runs along Delaware Avenue westward from 10th Street and Market Street.\n\nThese contrasting topography and soil conditions affected the industrial and residential development patterns within the city. The hilly west side was more attractive for the original residential areas, offering springs and sites for [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s, better [[air quality]], and fewer [[mosquitoes]].\n\n===Surrounding municipalities===\n{{Geographic location\n|Northwest = [[Greenville, Delaware]]\n|North = [[Talleyville, Delaware]]\n|Northeast = [[Bellefonte, Delaware]]\n|West = [[Elsmere, Delaware]]\n|Center = Wilmington, Delaware\n|South = [[New Castle, Delaware]]\n|Southwest = [[Newport, Delaware]]\n|Southeast = [[Pennsville, New Jersey]]\n|East = [[Penns Grove, New Jersey]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nWilmington has a warm [[temperate climate]] or [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot and humid summers, cool to cold winters, and precipitation evenly spread throughout the year.

The Financial Center Development Act of 1981, among other things, eliminated the [[usury]] laws enacted by most states, thereby removing the cap on interest rates that banks may legally charge customers. Major credit card issuers such as [[Barclays|Barclays Bank of Delaware]] (formerly [[Juniper Bank]]), are headquartered in Wilmington. The Dutch banking giant [[ING Groep N.V.]] headquartered its U.S. internet banking unit, [[ING Direct]] (now Capital One 360), in Wilmington. [[Wilmington Trust]] is headquartered in Wilmington at [[Rodney Square]]. Barclays and Capital One 360 have very large and prominent locations along the waterfront of the [[Christina River]]. In 1988, the Delaware legislature enacted a law which required a would-be acquirer to capture 85 percent of a Delaware chartered corporation's stock in a single transaction or wait three years before proceeding. This law strengthened Delaware's position as a safe haven for corporate charters during an especially turbulent time filled with hostile takeovers.\n\nWilmington's other notable industries include insurance (American Life Insurance Company [ALICO], Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Delaware), [[retail banking]] (including the Delaware headquarters of: [[Wilmington Trust]] (Now a branch of [[M&T Bank]], after Wilmington Trust merged with M&T in 2011), [[PNC Bank]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[HSBC]], [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Bank]], [[WSFS Bank|Wilmington Savings Fund Society]], and Artisans' Bank), and legal services.

The war created enormous demand for goods and materials supplied by Wilmington including ships, railroad cars, gunpowder, shoes, and other war-related goods.\n\nBy 1868, Wilmington was producing more iron ships than the rest of the country combined and it rated first in the production of gunpowder and second in carriages and leather. Due to the prosperity Wilmington enjoyed during the war, city merchants and manufacturers expanded Wilmington's residential boundaries westward in the form of large homes along tree-lined streets. This movement was spurred by the first horsecar line, which was initiated in 1864 along Delaware Avenue.\n\n[[File:Wilmington, Del. (2674627824).jpg|thumb|right|Map of Wilmington, Delaware, 1874]]\n\nThe late 19th century saw the development of the city's first comprehensive park system. [[William Poole Bancroft]], a successful Wilmington businessman influenced by the work of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], led the effort to establish open parkland in Wilmington. [[Rockford Park]] and [[Brandywine Park]] were created due to Bancroft's efforts.\n\nBoth World Wars stimulated the city's industries. Industries vital to the war effort \u2013 shipyards, steel foundries, machinery, and chemical producers \u2013 operated around the clock. Other industries produced such goods as automobiles, leather products, and clothing. In desperate need of workers more and more minorities moved to the north and settled in places like Wilmington. This led to tensions that occasionally boiled over like the [[Wilmington, Delaware race riot of 1919]].\n\nThe post-war prosperity again pushed residential development further out of the city. In the 1950s, more people began living in the suburbs of North Wilmington and commuting into the city to work. This was made possible by extensive upgrades to area roads and highways and through the construction of [[Interstate 95]], which cut through several of Wilmington's neighborhoods and accelerated the city's population decline. Urban renewal projects in the 1950s and 1960s cleared entire blocks of housing in the Center City and East Side areas.\n\nRiots and civil unrest in the city followed the 1968 assassination of Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] On April 9, 1968, Governor [[Charles L. Terry, Jr.]] deployed the [[Delaware Army National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[Delaware State Police]] to the city at the request of Mayor John Babiarz. Babiarz asked Terry to withdraw the National Guard the following week, but the governor kept them in the city until his term ended in January 1969. This is reportedly the longest occupation of an American city by state forces in the nation's history.<ref name=\"Boyer\">{{Citation |last=Boyer |first=William W. |title=Governing Delaware: Policy Problems In The First State |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA57 |format=eBook |page=57 |chapter=Chapter Three: The Governor as Leader |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Delaware Press]] (eBook: Google) |location=Newark, Delaware |isbn=0-87413-721-7 |oclc=609154858 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&lpg=PA57&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606212918/http://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA57 |archive-date=June 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, job growth and office construction were spurred by the arrival of national banks and financial institutions in the wake of the 1981 Financial Center Development Act, which liberalized the laws governing banks operating within the state, and similar laws in 1986. Today, many national and international banks, including [[Bank of America]], [[Capital One]], [[JPMorgan Chase & Co.|Chase]], and [[Barclays]], have operations in the city, typically credit card operations.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Wilmington aerial.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Wilmington]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.0|mi2|km2}}. Of that, {{convert|10.9|mi2|km2}} is land and {{convert|6.2|mi2|km2}} is water. The total area is 36.25% water.\n\nThe city sits at the confluence of the [[Christina River]] and the [[Delaware River]], about {{convert|33|mi|km}} southwest of [[Philadelphia]]. [[Wilmington station (Delaware)|Wilmington Train Station]], one of the southernmost stops on Philadelphia's [[SEPTA]] rail transportation system, is also served by [[Northeast Corridor]] [[Amtrak]] passenger trains. Wilmington is served by [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Delaware)|I-495]] within city limits. In addition, the twin-span [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], a few miles south of the city, provides direct highway access between Delaware and New Jersey, carrying the [[Interstate 295 (Delaware)|I-295]] eastern bypass route around Wilmington and Philadelphia, as well as [[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|US 40]], which continues eastward to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].\n\nThese transportation links and geographic proximity give Wilmington some of the characteristics of a [[satellite city]] to Philadelphia, but Wilmington's long history as Delaware's principal city, its urban core, and its independent value as a business destination makes it more properly considered a small but independent city in the Philadelphia [[metropolitan area]].\n\nWilmington lies along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] geological transition from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Mid-Atlantic Piedmont Plateau]] to the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]]. East of Market Street, and along both sides of the Christina River, the Coastal Plain land is flat, low-lying, and in places marshy. The Delaware River here is an [[estuary]] at sea level (with twice-daily high and low tides), providing [[sea level|sea-level]] access for ocean-going ships.\n\nOn the western side of Market Street, the Piedmont topography is rocky and hilly, rising to a point that marks the watershed between the Brandywine River and the Christina River. This watershed line runs along Delaware Avenue westward from 10th Street and Market Street.\n\nThese contrasting topography and soil conditions affected the industrial and residential development patterns within the city. The hilly west side was more attractive for the original residential areas, offering springs and sites for [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s, better [[air quality]], and fewer [[mosquitoes]].\n\n===Surrounding municipalities===\n{{Geographic location\n|Northwest = [[Greenville, Delaware]]\n|North = [[Talleyville, Delaware]]\n|Northeast = [[Bellefonte, Delaware]]\n|West = [[Elsmere, Delaware]]\n|Center = Wilmington, Delaware\n|South = [[New Castle, Delaware]]\n|Southwest = [[Newport, Delaware]]\n|Southeast = [[Pennsville, New Jersey]]\n|East = [[Penns Grove, New Jersey]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nWilmington has a warm [[temperate climate]] or [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot and humid summers, cool to cold winters, and precipitation evenly spread throughout the year.

The Financial Center Development Act of 1981, among other things, eliminated the [[usury]] laws enacted by most states, thereby removing the cap on interest rates that banks may legally charge customers. Major credit card issuers such as [[Barclays|Barclays Bank of Delaware]] (formerly [[Juniper Bank]]), are headquartered in Wilmington. The Dutch banking giant [[ING Groep N.V.]] headquartered its U.S. internet banking unit, [[ING Direct]] (now Capital One 360), in Wilmington. [[Wilmington Trust]] is headquartered in Wilmington at [[Rodney Square]]. Barclays and Capital One 360 have very large and prominent locations along the waterfront of the [[Christina River]]. In 1988, the Delaware legislature enacted a law which required a would-be acquirer to capture 85 percent of a Delaware chartered corporation's stock in a single transaction or wait three years before proceeding. This law strengthened Delaware's position as a safe haven for corporate charters during an especially turbulent time filled with hostile takeovers.\n\nWilmington's other notable industries include insurance (American Life Insurance Company [ALICO], Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Delaware), [[retail banking]] (including the Delaware headquarters of: [[Wilmington Trust]] (Now a branch of [[M&T Bank]], after Wilmington Trust merged with M&T in 2011), [[PNC Bank]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[HSBC]], [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Bank]], [[WSFS Bank|Wilmington Savings Fund Society]], and Artisans' Bank), and legal services.

Notable among its museums is the Delaware Art Museum whose collection focuses on American art and illustration from the 19th to the 21st century, and on the English Pre-Raphaelite movement of the mid-19th century.\n\n===Ethnic festivals===\nWilmington has an active and diverse ethnic population, which contributes to several ethnic festivals held every spring and summer in Wilmington, the most popular of which is the Italian Festival.

Another, somewhat smaller festival that draws large crowds is the Greek Festival, which is organized by Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church. The event features traditional Greek (Hellenic) crafts, food, drink, and music. Another notable annual festival is the Polish festival organized by St. Hedwig's Catholic Church, which features Polish cuisine with carnival rides and entertainment.

Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] forced the then segregated schools of New Castle County to desegregate. However, the subsequent eleven school districts that were created in the county, including the Wilmington School District, soon became de facto segregated, as the Wilmington School District became predominately black, and the districts outside the city remained overwhelmingly white. In response, the 1976 U.S. District Court decision [[Evans v. Buchanan]] implemented a plan by which students in Wilmington would be bused to attend school in the suburbs for certain grades, while suburban students would be [[Desegregation busing in the United States|bused]] into the City of Wilmington for other grades. By 1981, the four current districts in northern New Castle County, Brandywine, Christina, [[Colonial School District (Delaware)|Colonial]], and Red Clay, each composed of city and suburban areas, were established.

Sir John Bourchier, who in 1622 was released from all crown debts relating to it since 1611, made a formal proposal to amalgamate the alum and soap businesses, with compensation to Ingram, but then neutralized Ingram's interest by bringing charges against him for misappropriation of funds and breach of contract. Ingram was arrested and taken to London in October 1624. Such was the evidence presented to the resulting Exchequer Commission that Ingram was obliged to surrender the business in February 1625.

He bought land for the purpose from Thomas Sandwith in 1629/30 and the building was completed in 1632. The almshouse provided for ten poor widows. Built of dark red brick with stone facings and a tiled roof, it is dominated by a low central tower over a former tower and caretaker's rooms. The decorative central doorway, of c1190, was bought from [[Medieval parish churches of York#Holy Trinity, Micklegate|Holy Trinity Priory, Micklegate]] \u2013 its provenance is recorded in the Ingram accounts at Temple Newsam, though there has been an alternative theory that it came from [[Medieval parish churches of York#St Giles, Gillygate|St Giles church]], formerly in Gillygate.<ref>C.

Sir John Bourchier, who in 1622 was released from all crown debts relating to it since 1611, made a formal proposal to amalgamate the alum and soap businesses, with compensation to Ingram, but then neutralized Ingram's interest by bringing charges against him for misappropriation of funds and breach of contract. Ingram was arrested and taken to London in October 1624. Such was the evidence presented to the resulting Exchequer Commission that Ingram was obliged to surrender the business in February 1625. However, through his favour with the King, and the larger processes surrounding the [[Statute of Monopolies]] of May 1624, he escaped from the affair very lightly.<ref>''English Patents of Monopoly'', [https://archive.org/stream/englishpatentsm01pricgoog#page/n114/mode/2up pp. 92-95]. cf.

He bought land for the purpose from Thomas Sandwith in 1629/30 and the building was completed in 1632. The almshouse provided for ten poor widows. Built of dark red brick with stone facings and a tiled roof, it is dominated by a low central tower over a former tower and caretaker's rooms. The decorative central doorway, of c1190, was bought from [[Medieval parish churches of York#Holy Trinity, Micklegate|Holy Trinity Priory, Micklegate]] \u2013 its provenance is recorded in the Ingram accounts at Temple Newsam, though there has been an alternative theory that it came from [[Medieval parish churches of York#St Giles, Gillygate|St Giles church]], formerly in Gillygate.<ref>C. Smith, ''The Almshouses of York: Medieval Charity to Modern Welfare'' (Quacks Books, 2011). {{ISBN|978-1904446309}}.</ref>\n\nBirch relates that Ingram took one Mr Garbut of Leeds to see the almshouses to get his opinion of them:<blockquote> '...which though he was loath to give, yet being urged, he told him, it was too little. \"Why\", said Sir A., \"the rooms are big enough, and it's in every man's choice what number he will admit.\" \"However,\" said Mr G., \"it is too little to hold those that you have undone.\" '<ref>''Chapters in the History of Yorkshire'', p. 198 (note).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is thought that Ingram died at York in 1642 as the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] was breaking out. In January 1642, fearing for the safety of his family and retinue, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] left the London area for the north of the country, and was a guest of Sir Arthur Ingram in his York House for some part of this period.

{"title_page": "Oui Be Negroes", "text_new": "\n\n\n'''Oui Be Negroes''' is an [[African-American]] [[improvisational]] [[sketch comedy]] ensemble, founded by Artistic Director Shaun Landry and Director Hans Summers. They worked together for years in [[Chicago]] with the Underground Theatre Conspiracy, and had thrown around the idea of an African-American-driven sketch and [[improvisational]] comedy troupe, which would be geared specifically toward social and political humor.\n\n[[File:Oui Be Negroes Original Cast 1994.JPG|thumb|Oui Be Negroes Original Chicago Cast 1994]]\n\n== Before Oui Be Negroes ==\n'''The Underground Theatre Conspiracy''' (UTC) was founded by Hans Summers in 1985 with performers he had worked with at the Players' Workshop of the Second City. In the beginning. the roster of players looked largely like one of the hundreds that could be found in the 1980s performing at any space available on the Northside of Chicago. But the UTC had one major difference, in that they produced the first [[multimedia]] comedy in the city. It blended stage performance with prerecorded video material and a live camera. The show with the unlikely title of \"Fooglewoogle-The Multi-Media Comedy\" was warmly received. \"The evening ranges between the security of canned video segments (theater as television) and the insecurity of improv comedy combined with live video segments. It\u2019s an interesting rush to go from the frozen, two-dimensional hilarity of the comedy videos to the wild and crazy stuff generated by these basic improv games.\" (Lawrence Bommer) ''[[Windy City Times]]''\n\nAfter two successful runs Shaun Landry was added to the UTC's roster of performers. This came at a time (1986) when Shaun was one of three African Americans performing improv comedy in the city of Chicago. From the very beginning Shaun was a major force with the UTC. As early as 1987 Shaun and Hans attempted to organize a minority-driven comedy ensemble but without any luck.\n\nRegardless of that, the UTC continued to be a steady force throughout the late 1980s averaging two or more original stage productions a year; \"Batman Died for Our Sins\", \"A Sweet Home Chicago\", \"Space, An Exploration of What's Between Us\", \"Are We Alone and if so Who Are You?\" \"This group makes you feel good again about something all of us at times tend to overlook; the mere reason for which we go to the theatre in the first place; to be entertained. These guys not only go out on the edge, they take you there with them. One feels as though they've left the theatre with a virtual doggy-bag full of food for thought.\" (Richard Morris) [[Performink]]\n\nIn 1990, Hans and Shaun decided to take it on the road relocating the company to [[Seattle]]. There they continued to be productive with their brand of humor; \u201cTwin Lakes or Who Killed Laura Petrie\", Silence of the Yams or Guess Who We're Having for Dinner\", \"The Improv Thang\" \"Neither David Lynch\u2019s cult sudser nor Dick Van Dyke\u2019s perky TV wife figures into this improvisational comedy revue, but few other subjects are left unmocked by the quick-witted '''Underground Theatre Conspiracy'''. Recently transplanted from Chicago, the troupe blitzes through a series of sketches, blackout gags, and running jokes with a winning blend of pointed satire and casual good cheer.\" (A. J. Mell) ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' But when they were asked to produce a show for the Seattle Fringe Festival, what came out was the forerunner of what would become the Oui Be Negroes style of show. ''Tales From the Crib'' was a two-person show that examined interracial issues and turned out to be one of the hits of the festival. At that point Shaun and Hans felt that the time might be right for a minority company and what better place to kick it off then back home in Chicago.\n\n== Birth of Oui Be Negroes 1994-2000 ==\n\u201cBasically, the \u2018Oui\u2019 part comes from African Americans who went over to France in the '20s and \u201830s and did very well for themselves, folks like [[Fats Waller]] and [[Josephine Baker]]. It's homage to that,\u201d Landry says, pausing. \u201cAnd it's just damn funny.\u201d Landry explains that most people giggle when they hear the name, but every now and then, it makes \u201cvery nice liberal white folks\u201d just a little nervous.\" (Patti Hartigan) ''[[Boston Globe]]'' \u201cFor example, \u201cLandry says, \u201cduring the O. J.(Simpson) trial we did a game show format called \u2018Who do you Blame?\u2019 and the guilty party was always a black man in a stocking cap. African-American audiences are the most responsive. ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]''\n\nIn 1993, Landry actively went seeking actors of color and ran upon them at [[The Second City]] Outreach Program. There she assembled the original ensemble along with Summers as the lone [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] member, they mounted '''Oui Be Negroes\u2019''' first show at Cafe Voltaire in Chicago.\n\n\"The big thing was: Be who you are,\" Landry says. \"Don't hold back on anything.\" In part (with OBN) she hoped to provide an alternative to white-majority teams where black actors could avoid roles that might come off as stereotypical: big mamas, pimps, dice-rolling hustlers and the like. (Darel Jevens) ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n\nOui Be Negroes presented original satirical show with names like \"Can We Dance with Yo Dates<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/oui-be-negroes-in-can-we-dance-with-yo-dates/Content?oid=886896|title=Oui Be Negroes In Can We Dance With Yo Dates?|website=Chicago Reader|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref>\", \"One Drop is All It Takes\", \"Once You Go Black\", \"All Coons Look Alike to Me\" (inspired by the popular [[Coon Song]] of 1896) \"The Artists Formerly Known as Oui Be Negroes\" and \"Absolute [[Negritude]]\" in [[Chicago]] from 1994 through 1999 that explored black culture and history before relocating the troupe to [[San Francisco]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=So, Woman Walks into a Room...and Finds a Hundred Other Performers Who are Taking Comedy Just as Seriously.|last=Johnson|first=Allan|date=September 6, 2000|work=Chicago Tribune|id = {{ProQuest|419140372}}}}</ref>.\n\nIntelligent alacrity has always characterized the work of Shaun Landry and Hans Summers, founding members of the comedy troupe Oui Be Negroes. And in their most recent revue, these two plus Merle Dandridge and Marvin Howard probe the corners of our culture for satirical humor often overlooked by...or flat-out forbidden to other comedians.(Mary Shen Barnidge) ''[[Chicago Reader]]''\n\nOBN has toured all over the United States from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Los Angeles]] to [[Austin]] to [[Boston]], in addition to performances outside of the U.S. in [[Canada]] and the [[Netherlands]].\n\n[[File:Oui Be Negroes San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Marcus Sams, Hans Summers and Shaun Landry at the San Francisco Improv Festival 2008]]\n\n== Oui Be Negroes in SF 2000-2009 ==\nIn year 2000, '''Oui Be Negroes''' relocated from its birthplace in [[Chicago]] to [[San Francisco]] California. There they continued to produce sketch and improvisational shows with an edge such as \"X\", \"To [[Pigmeat Markham]] Thanks for Everything, [[Spike Lee]]\" 'Bury [[James Brown]] as well as being the house ensemble of [[The San Francisco Improv Alliance]]. \"their style and attitude, not to mention their threadbare theater, is reminiscent of the legendary San Francisco sketch and improv group from the '60s and '70s, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]].\" (Pat Craig) ''[[Contra Costa Times]]''\n\n== Oui Be Negroes, Los Angeles 2009- ==\nIn 2009, Landry & Summers made the latest big jump to [[Los Angeles]] where they continue to produce Oui Be Negroes show as well as duo performances as '''Landry & Summers''' at [[Improv Olympic]] West, [[The Second City]] LA as well as the [[Avery Schreiber]] Theatre in North Hollywood. Their first extended duo show in Los Angeles entitled 'Yes, We Are F**king' played at [[The Second City]] LA during the 2009 holiday season. \"Their chemistry is just as obvious off-stage as well. In an interview following their opening-night performance, the bubbly Landry \u2013 who is frequently mistaken for her friend, \u201cPine Sol Lady\u201d Diane Amos \u2013 and the reserved, serious Summers \u2013 who, with his shock of grey hair, looks more like a college professor than an actor and comedian \u2013 often finished each other\u2019s thoughts and sentences.\" Leon Acord - ''WEHO News''\n\nOui Be Negroes celebrated their 15 Anniversary by returning home to Chicago to perform as part of the 12th Annual Chicago Improv Festival.\n\nLandry & Summers continue to perform their biting style of social and political humor in 2010 with '''Interraciallicious''' at [[M.I.'s Westside Comedy Theater]] in [[Santa Monica]], CA and as featured act for DuoFest 2010 in [[Philadelphia]], PA.

Recently transplanted from Chicago, the troupe blitzes through a series of sketches, blackout gags, and running jokes with a winning blend of pointed satire and casual good cheer.\" (A. J. Mell) ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' But when they were asked to produce a show for the Seattle Fringe Festival, what came out was the forerunner of what would become the Oui Be Negroes style of show. ''Tales From the Crib'' was a two-person show that examined interracial issues and turned out to be one of the hits of the festival. At that point Shaun and Hans felt that the time might be right for a minority company and what better place to kick it off then back home in Chicago.\n\n== Birth of Oui Be Negroes 1994-2000 ==\n\u201cBasically, the \u2018Oui\u2019 part comes from African Americans who went over to France in the '20s and \u201830s and did very well for themselves, folks like [[Fats Waller]] and [[Josephine Baker]]. It's homage to that,\u201d Landry says, pausing. \u201cAnd it's just damn funny.\u201d Landry explains that most people giggle when they hear the name, but every now and then, it makes \u201cvery nice liberal white folks\u201d just a little nervous.\" (Patti Hartigan) ''[[Boston Globe]]'' \u201cFor example, \u201cLandry says, \u201cduring the O. J.(Simpson) trial we did a game show format called \u2018Who do you Blame?\u2019 and the guilty party was always a black man in a stocking cap. African-American audiences are the most responsive. ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]''\n\nIn 1993, Landry actively went seeking actors of color and ran upon them at [[The Second City]] Outreach Program. There she assembled the original ensemble along with Summers as the lone [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] member, they mounted '''Oui Be Negroes\u2019''' first show at Cafe Voltaire in Chicago.\n\n\"The big thing was: Be who you are,\" Landry says. \"Don't hold back on anything.\" In part (with OBN) she hoped to provide an alternative to white-majority teams where black actors could avoid roles that might come off as stereotypical: big mamas, pimps, dice-rolling hustlers and the like. (Darel Jevens) ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n\nOui Be Negroes presented original satirical show with names like \"Can We Dance with Yo Dates<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/oui-be-negroes-in-can-we-dance-with-yo-dates/Content?oid=886896|title=Oui Be Negroes In Can We Dance With Yo Dates?|website=Chicago Reader|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref>\", \"One Drop is All It Takes\", \"Once You Go Black\", \"All Coons Look Alike to Me\" (inspired by the popular [[Coon Song]] of 1896) \"The Artists Formerly Known as Oui Be Negroes\" and \"Absolute [[Negritude]]\" in [[Chicago]] from 1994 through 1999 that explored black culture and history before relocating the troupe to [[San Francisco]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=So, Woman Walks into a Room...and Finds a Hundred Other Performers Who are Taking Comedy Just as Seriously.|last=Johnson|first=Allan|date=September 6, 2000|work=Chicago Tribune|id = {{ProQuest|419140372}}}}</ref>.\n\nIntelligent alacrity has always characterized the work of Shaun Landry and Hans Summers, founding members of the comedy troupe Oui Be Negroes. And in their most recent revue, these two plus Merle Dandridge and Marvin Howard probe the corners of our culture for satirical humor often overlooked by...or flat-out forbidden to other comedians.(Mary Shen Barnidge) ''[[Chicago Reader]]''\n\nOBN has toured all over the United States from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Los Angeles]] to [[Austin]] to [[Boston]], in addition to performances outside of the U.S. in [[Canada]] and the [[Netherlands]].\n\n[[File:Oui Be Negroes San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Marcus Sams, Hans Summers and Shaun Landry at the San Francisco Improv Festival 2008]]\n\n== Oui Be Negroes in SF 2000-2009 ==\nIn year 2000, '''Oui Be Negroes''' relocated from its birthplace in [[Chicago]] to [[San Francisco]] California. There they continued to produce sketch and improvisational shows with an edge such as \"X\", \"To [[Pigmeat Markham]] Thanks for Everything, [[Spike Lee]]\" 'Bury [[James Brown]] as well as being the house ensemble of [[The San Francisco Improv Alliance]]. \"their style and attitude, not to mention their threadbare theater, is reminiscent of the legendary San Francisco sketch and improv group from the '60s and '70s, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]].\" (Pat Craig) ''[[Contra Costa Times]]''\n\n== Oui Be Negroes, Los Angeles 2009- ==\nIn 2009, Landry & Summers made the latest big jump to [[Los Angeles]] where they continue to produce Oui Be Negroes show as well as duo performances as '''Landry & Summers''' at [[Improv Olympic]] West, [[The Second City]] LA as well as the [[Avery Schreiber]] Theatre in North Hollywood. Their first extended duo show in Los Angeles entitled 'Yes, We Are F**king' played at [[The Second City]] LA during the 2009 holiday season. \"Their chemistry is just as obvious off-stage as well. In an interview following their opening-night performance, the bubbly Landry \u2013 who is frequently mistaken for her friend, \u201cPine Sol Lady\u201d Diane Amos \u2013 and the reserved, serious Summers \u2013 who, with his shock of grey hair, looks more like a college professor than an actor and comedian \u2013 often finished each other\u2019s thoughts and sentences.\" Leon Acord - ''WEHO News''\n\nOui Be Negroes celebrated their 15 Anniversary by returning home to Chicago to perform as part of the 12th Annual Chicago Improv Festival.\n\nLandry & Summers continue to perform their biting style of social and political humor in 2010 with '''Interraciallicious''' at [[M.I.'s Westside Comedy Theater]] in [[Santa Monica]], CA and as featured act for DuoFest 2010 in [[Philadelphia]], PA. We loved it! The chemistry between the two is wonderful. I was sad to have to say goodnight - we would have loved to have spent hours getting to know these talented actors. \u2013 [[Goldstar Events]] audience comments about Interraciallicious\n\n== References ==\n*[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/15/PKGCMQRLV11.DTL&type=performance Improv Making up for Lost Time by Sam Hurwitt San Francisco Chronicle July 15 2007]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Whose-Improv-Anyway-Beyond-Second/dp/1578063418 Whose Improv Is It Anyway Beyond the Second City Amy Seham University Press of Mississippi (July 2001)]\n* [http://www.coolashelltheatre.com/podcasts/oui-be-negroes/ Cool As Hell Theater Podcast NPR]\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CC&s_site=contracostatimes&p_multi=CC&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1064A1F240586A9F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Small Theater Sometimes has Big Rewards by Pat Craig Contra Costa Times January 25, 2002]\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&p_theme=kc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF44BC0AD6C95C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Improving their improv A bunch of comics will share funny feelings in Kansas City's Spontaneous Combustion festival Brian McTavish Arts & Entertainment Writer, Kansas City Star 09-09-97]\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&p_theme=dp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF45190BA60689&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Oui Shall Overcome: Black improvisers no longer play second fiddle in Chicago by Ed Will Denver Post Staff Writer February 23, 1999]\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDC905C3CDFB0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM African American Troupe Laughs at Itself by Patti Hartigan, Boston Glob February 7, 1997]\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4221336FE2A0C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM DO BE DO BE DO - Chicago Sun Times 02-2007]\n*[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-artists-formally-known-as-oui-be-negros-and-the-playground/Content?oid=898674 The Artists Formally Known as Oui Be Negros and The Playground by Jack Helbig - Chicago Reader March 18, 1999]\n\n;Specific\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.ouibenegroes.com/ Oui Be Negroes]\n\n[[Category:American comedy troupes]]\n[[Category:Improvisational troupes]]\n[[Category:Sketch comedy troupes]]\n[[Category:African-American culture]]\n[[Category:African-American arts organizations]]\n[[Category:Performing groups established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Chicago]]\n[[Category:1993 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "Hvsobn", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oui_Be_Negroes"}
