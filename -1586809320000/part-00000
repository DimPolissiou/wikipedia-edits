A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used [[Dice notation|3d6]] in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for 3rd edition is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. 4th edition allows for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result.

Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.\" (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.<ref>Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]].\n\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on ''[[Stranger Things]]'', was released in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/stranger-things-dd-roleplaying-game-starter-set|title=Stranger Things D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set {{!}} Dungeons & Dragons|website=dnd.wizards.com|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/22/18511302/stranger-things-dungeons-and-dragons-starter-set-review|title=Stranger Things D&D Starter Set is a surprisingly good introduction to the game|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2019-04-22|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> A campaign based on the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons'']] comic book series was later released in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-and-morty-rpg-is-stupid-ir-1839783831|title=Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty RPG Is Stupid, Irreverent Fun...Especially for DMs|website=io9|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-morty-adventure/|title=We Played a D&D VS RICK AND MORTY Adventure|website=Nerdist|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.\n\n===Miniature figures===\n{{Main|Miniature figure (gaming)}}\n[[File:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures. The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">[[Dungeons & Dragons#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ]]</ref><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons & Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theater]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], orcs, [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game.<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref><ref>Drout; \"J.R.R.

(Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 224)</ref> Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as [[Van vogt|A.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format.

A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used [[Dice notation|3d6]] in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for 3rd edition is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. 4th edition allows for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 41</ref>\n\n===Adventures and campaigns===\n{{Main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings}}\n\nA typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an \"adventure\", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 43</ref> The DM can either design an original adventure, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as \"modules\") that have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.\" (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.<ref>Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]].\n\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on ''[[Stranger Things]]'', was released in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/stranger-things-dd-roleplaying-game-starter-set|title=Stranger Things D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set {{!}} Dungeons & Dragons|website=dnd.wizards.com|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/22/18511302/stranger-things-dungeons-and-dragons-starter-set-review|title=Stranger Things D&D Starter Set is a surprisingly good introduction to the game|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2019-04-22|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> A campaign based on the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons'']] comic book series was later released in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-and-morty-rpg-is-stupid-ir-1839783831|title=Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty RPG Is Stupid, Irreverent Fun...Especially for DMs|website=io9|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/dungeons-dragons-vs-rick-morty-adventure/|title=We Played a D&D VS RICK AND MORTY Adventure|website=Nerdist|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.\n\n===Miniature figures===\n{{Main|Miniature figure (gaming)}}\n[[File:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures. The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">[[Dungeons & Dragons#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ]]</ref><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons & Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theatre]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], orcs, [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game.<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref><ref>Drout; \"J.R.R.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986) sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|title=Basic set|work=Acaeum.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624215519/http://acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Schick 133\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', p. 133</ref> Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.<ref>Gygax; \"Dungeons & Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going\" in ''The Dragon'' #21</ref> The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'', which was released alongside a new [[Dungeons & Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|introductory boxed set]].\n\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition'' was published in 1989,<ref name=\"history\"/> again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,<ref>\"This is not ''AD&D'' 3rd edition\" Winter, Steven (in the forward to Cook; ''Player's Handbook'').</ref> and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional rulebooks.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe release of ''AD&D 2nd Edition'' deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types&nbsp;\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs&nbsp;\u2013 were removed.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\">Ward; \"The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them)\" in ''Dragon'' #154</ref> The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.<ref>Cook; ''Player's Handbook'' (1989), pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies&nbsp;\u2013 skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\"/> A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy.

It contains four previously unreleased tracks originally recorded by the 2008\u20132011 line-up of the group and intended for release on an album, but ultimately weren't included on ''[[Fly from Here]]''. During this time, the lineup included bassist [[Chris Squire]], guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], singer [[Beno\u00eet David]], and keyboardist [[Oliver Wakeman]].

The line-up is bassist [[Chris Squire]], guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], singer [[Beno\u00eet David]] and keyboardist [[Oliver Wakeman]].

The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>\n\nThe boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow.

The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>\n\nThe boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>\n\n==Career==\nLike the rest of her class, ''G2''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]].
