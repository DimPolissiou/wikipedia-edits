The true purpose of such an offer is for the perpetrator to [[extortion|extort]] money from the victim, either by charging a fee to join the scheme, or requiring the victim to invest in products whose resale value is misrepresented.<ref name=\"falsehopes\">{{cite web|url= https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2006/12/federal-state-law-enforcers-complete-bogus-business-opportunity |title = Federal, State Law Enforcers Complete Bogus Business Opportunity Sweep|author = Federal Trade Commission|publisher = ftc.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nWork-at-home schemes have been around for decades, with the classic \"envelope stuffing\" scam originating in the United States during [[the Depression]] in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"scambusters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scambusters.org/work-at-home.html |title=Top 10 Work At Home and Home Based Business Scams |accessdate=8 December 2010 }}</ref> In this scam, the worker is offered entry to a scheme where they can earn $2 for every envelope they fill. After paying a small $2 fee to join the scheme, the victim is sent a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] template for the self-same work-from-home scheme, and instructed to post these advertisements around their local area&nbsp;&ndash; the victim is simply \"stuffing envelopes\" with flyer templates that perpetuate the scheme.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> Originally found as printed adverts in [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, variants of this scam have expanded into more modern media, such as [[television]] and [[radio]] adverts, and forum posts on the [[Internet]].\n\nIn some countries, law enforcement agencies work to fight work-at-home schemes. In 2006, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] established [[Project False Hopes]], a federal and state law enforcement sweep that targets bogus business opportunity and work at home scams. The crackdown involved more than 100 law enforcement actions by the FTC, the Department of Justice, the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and law enforcement agencies in eleven states.<ref name=\"falsehopes\"/>\n\nLegitimate [[home-based business]] and [[telecommuting]] opportunities do exist, and many people do their jobs in the comfort of their own homes, but anyone seeking such an employment opportunity can be scammed by accepting a home employment offer. A 2007 report in the United States suggested that about 97% of work-at-home offers were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TakeControlOfYourLife/story?id=3003833&page=1 |title=Working From Home: Don't Get Scammed |publisher=ABC: Good Morning America |date= 2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> Many legitimate jobs at home require some form of post-high-school education, such as a [[college degree]] or certificate, or [[trade school]], and some experience in the field in an office or other supervised setting. Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment. In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that ''under no circumstances'' should anyone be forced to pay a fee in order to obtain a job. In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount.

The true purpose of such an offer is for the perpetrator to [[extortion|extort]] money from the victim, either by charging a fee to join the scheme, or requiring the victim to invest in products whose resale value is misrepresented.<ref name=\"falsehopes\">{{cite web|url= https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2006/12/federal-state-law-enforcers-complete-bogus-business-opportunity |title = Federal, State Law Enforcers Complete Bogus Business Opportunity Sweep|author = Federal Trade Commission|publisher = ftc.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nWork-at-home schemes have been around for decades, with the classic \"envelope stuffing\" scam originating in the United States during [[the Depression]] in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"scambusters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scambusters.org/work-at-home.html |title=Top 10 Work At Home and Home Based Business Scams |accessdate=8 December 2010 }}</ref> In this scam, the worker is offered entry to a scheme where they can earn $2 for every envelope they fill. After paying a small $2 fee to join the scheme, the victim is sent a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] template for the self-same work-from-home scheme, and instructed to post these advertisements around their local area&nbsp;&ndash; the victim is simply \"stuffing envelopes\" with flyer templates that perpetuate the scheme.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> Originally found as printed adverts in [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, variants of this scam have expanded into more modern media, such as [[television]] and [[radio]] adverts, and forum posts on the [[Internet]].\n\nIn some countries, law enforcement agencies work to fight work-at-home schemes. In 2006, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] established [[Project False Hopes]], a federal and state law enforcement sweep that targets bogus business opportunity and work at home scams. The crackdown involved more than 100 law enforcement actions by the FTC, the Department of Justice, the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and law enforcement agencies in eleven states.<ref name=\"falsehopes\"/>\n\nLegitimate [[home-based business]] and [[telecommuting]] opportunities do exist, and many people do their jobs in the comfort of their own homes, but anyone seeking such an employment opportunity can be scammed by accepting a home employment offer. A 2007 report in the United States suggested that about 97% of work-at-home offers were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TakeControlOfYourLife/story?id=3003833&page=1 |title=Working From Home: Don't Get Scammed |publisher=ABC: Good Morning America |date= 2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> Many legitimate jobs at home require some form of post-high-school education, such as a [[college degree]] or certificate, or [[trade school]], and some experience in the field in an office or other supervised setting. Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment. In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that ''under no circumstances'' should anyone be forced to pay a fee in order to obtain a job. In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount.

{"title_page": "Accounts receivable", "text_new": "{{short description|Claims for payment held by a business}}\n{{Accounting}}\n'''[https://www.m1xchange.com/financiers.php Accounts receivable]''' are legally enforceable claims for payment held by a business for goods supplied and/or services rendered that customers/clients have ordered but not paid for. These are generally in the form of [[invoices]] raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame. Accounts receivable is shown in a [[balance sheet]] as an [[asset]]. It is one of a series of [[accounting]] transactions dealing with the billing of a [[customer]] for [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that the customer has ordered. These may be distinguished from [[notes receivable]], which are [[debt]]s created through formal [[legal instrument]]s called [[promissory note]]s.<ref>Belverd E. Needles, Marian Powers, Susan V. Crosson. (2010) ''Financial and Managerial Accounting'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xI8pEZIob9UC&pg=PA373&dq p. 373].</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAccounts receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an [[invoice]] and either mailing or [[Electronic billing|electronically]] delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called ''credit terms''{{cn|date=February 2019}} or ''payment terms''.\n\n*The sales a business has made.\n*The amount of money received for goods or services.\n*The amount of money owed at the end of each month varies (debtors).\n\nThe accounts receivable team is in charge of receiving funds on behalf of a company and applying it towards their current pending balances.\n\nCollections and cashiering teams are part of the accounts receivable department.\nWhile the collections department seeks the debtor, the cashiering team applies the monies received.\n\n== Payment terms ==\nAn example of a common payment term is [[Net 30 days]], which means that payment is due at the end of 30 days from the date of invoice. The [[debtor]] is free to pay before the due date; businesses can offer a [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] for early payment. Other common payment terms include Net 45, Net 60 and 30 days end of month. The creditor may be able to charge late fees or interest if the amount is not paid by the due date.\n\nIn practice, the terms are often shown as two fractions, with the discount and the discount period comprising the first fraction and the letter 'n' and the payment due period comprising the second fraction.  For instance, if a company makes a purchase and will receive a 2% discount for paying within 10 days, while the whole payment is due within 30 days, the terms would be shown as 2/10, n/30.\n\nBooking a receivable is accomplished by a simple accounting transaction; however, the process of maintaining and collecting payments on the accounts receivable subsidiary account balances can be a full-time proposition. Depending on the industry in practice, accounts receivable payments can be received up to 10 \u2013 15 days after the due date has been reached. These types of payment practices are sometimes developed by industry standards, corporate policy, or because of the financial condition of the client.\n\nSince not all customer debts will be collected, businesses typically estimate the amount of and then record an [[allowance for bad debts|allowance for doubtful accounts]]<ref>http://www.accountingtools.com/allowance-for-doubtful-account</ref> which appears on the balance sheet as a [[contra account]] that offsets total accounts receivable. When accounts receivable are not paid, some companies turn them over to third party [[Collection agency|collection agencies]] or [[Creditor's rights|collection attorneys]] who will attempt to recover the debt via negotiating payment plans, settlement offers or pursuing other legal action.\n\nOutstanding advances are part of accounts receivable if a company gets an order from its customers with payment terms agreed upon in advance. Since billing is done to claim the advances several times, this area of collectible is not reflected in accounts receivables. Ideally, since advance payment occurs within a mutually agreed-upon term, it is the responsibility of the accounts department to periodically take out the statement showing advance collectible and should be provided to sales & marketing for collection of advances. The payment of accounts receivable can be protected either by a [[letter of credit]] or by [[Trade Credit Insurance]].\n\n== Accounts Receivable Age Analysis ==\nAn Accountants Receivable Age Analysis, also known as the Debtors Book is divided in categories for current, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days or longer. The analysis or report is commonly known as an Aged Trial Balance. Customers are typically listed in alphabetic order or by the amount outstanding, or according to the company chart of accounts. Zero balances are not usually shown.\n\n== Bookkeeping ==\nOn a company's [[balance sheet]], accounts receivable are the money owed to that company by entities outside of the company. Account receivables are classified as [[current asset]]s assuming that they are due within one [[calendar year]] or [[fiscal year]]. To record a journal entry for a sale on account, one must [[debit]] a receivable and [[Credit (accounting)|credit]] a revenue account. When the customer pays off their accounts, one debits cash and credits the receivable in the journal entry. The ending balance on the [[trial balance]] sheet for accounts receivable is usually a debit.\n\nBusiness organizations which have become too large to perform such tasks by hand (or small ones that could but prefer not to do them by hand) will generally use [[accounting software]] on a [[computer]] to perform this task.\n\nCompanies have two methods available to them for measuring the net value of accounts receivable, which is generally computed by subtracting the balance of an allowance account from the accounts receivable account.\n\nThe first method is the '''allowance method''', which establishes a contra-asset account, ''allowance for doubtful accounts'', or ''bad debt provision'', that has the effect of reducing the balance for accounts receivable. The amount of the [[bad debt]] provision can be computed in two ways,  either (1) by reviewing each individual debt and deciding whether it is doubtful (a specific provision); or (2) by providing for a fixed percentage (e.g. 2%) of total debtors (a general provision). The change in the bad debt provision from year to year is posted to the bad debt expense account in the [[income statement]].\n\nThe allowance method can be calculated using either the income statement method, which is based upon a percentage of net credit sales; the balance sheet approach, which is based upon an aging schedule in which debts of a certain age are classified by risk, or a combination of both.\n\nThe second method is the ''direct write-off method''. It is simpler than the allowance method in that it allows for one simple entry to reduce accounts receivable to its net realizable value. The entry would consist of debiting a bad debt expense account and crediting the respective accounts receivable in the sales ledger.  The direct write-off method is not permissible under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].\n\nThe two methods are not mutually exclusive, and some businesses will have a provision for doubtful debts, writing off specific debts that they know to be bad (for example, if the debtor has gone into [[liquidation]].)\n\n== Special uses ==\nCompanies can use their accounts receivable as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] when obtaining a [[loan]] ([[asset-based lending]]). They may also sell them through [[factoring (finance)|factoring]] or on an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]]. Pools or portfolios of accounts receivable can be sold in [[capital markets]] through [[securitization]].\n\nFor tax reporting purposes, a general provision for bad debts is not an allowable deduction from profit<ref>{{cite web|last=HM Revenue & Customs |title=Company Taxation Manual |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm55710.htm |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073621/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm55710.htm |archivedate=2009-04-18 }}</ref> - a business can only get relief for specific debtors that have gone bad.

These are generally in the form of [[invoices]] raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame. Accounts receivable is shown in a [[balance sheet]] as an [[asset]]. It is one of a series of [[accounting]] transactions dealing with the billing of a [[customer]] for [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that the customer has ordered. These may be distinguished from [[notes receivable]], which are [[debt]]s created through formal [[legal instrument]]s called [[promissory note]]s.<ref>Belverd E. Needles, Marian Powers, Susan V. Crosson. (2010) ''Financial and Managerial Accounting'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xI8pEZIob9UC&pg=PA373&dq p. 373].</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAccounts receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an [[invoice]] and either mailing or [[Electronic billing|electronically]] delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called ''credit terms''{{cn|date=February 2019}} or ''payment terms''.\n\n*The sales a business has made.\n*The amount of money received for goods or services.\n*The amount of money owed at the end of each month varies (debtors).\n\nThe accounts receivable team is in charge of receiving funds on behalf of a company and applying it towards their current pending balances.\n\nCollections and cashiering teams are part of the accounts receivable department.\nWhile the collections department seeks the debtor, the cashiering team applies the monies received.\n\n== Payment terms ==\nAn example of a common payment term is [[Net 30 days]], which means that payment is due at the end of 30 days from the date of invoice. The [[debtor]] is free to pay before the due date; businesses can offer a [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] for early payment. Other common payment terms include Net 45, Net 60 and 30 days end of month. The creditor may be able to charge late fees or interest if the amount is not paid by the due date.\n\nIn practice, the terms are often shown as two fractions, with the discount and the discount period comprising the first fraction and the letter 'n' and the payment due period comprising the second fraction.  For instance, if a company makes a purchase and will receive a 2% discount for paying within 10 days, while the whole payment is due within 30 days, the terms would be shown as 2/10, n/30.\n\nBooking a receivable is accomplished by a simple accounting transaction; however, the process of maintaining and collecting payments on the accounts receivable subsidiary account balances can be a full-time proposition. Depending on the industry in practice, accounts receivable payments can be received up to 10 \u2013 15 days after the due date has been reached. These types of payment practices are sometimes developed by industry standards, corporate policy, or because of the financial condition of the client.\n\nSince not all customer debts will be collected, businesses typically estimate the amount of and then record an [[allowance for bad debts|allowance for doubtful accounts]]<ref>http://www.accountingtools.com/allowance-for-doubtful-account</ref> which appears on the balance sheet as a [[contra account]] that offsets total accounts receivable. When accounts receivable are not paid, some companies turn them over to third party [[Collection agency|collection agencies]] or [[Creditor's rights|collection attorneys]] who will attempt to recover the debt via negotiating payment plans, settlement offers or pursuing other legal action.\n\nOutstanding advances are part of accounts receivable if a company gets an order from its customers with payment terms agreed upon in advance. Since billing is done to claim the advances several times, this area of collectible is not reflected in accounts receivables. Ideally, since advance payment occurs within a mutually agreed-upon term, it is the responsibility of the accounts department to periodically take out the statement showing advance collectible and should be provided to sales & marketing for collection of advances.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named \"Commander\" the number-one summer jam of 2010 and named by [[Fitness Magazine]] as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010. The song was nominated at the [[International Dance Music Awards]] for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track. An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto, and portrays Rowland facing herself in various [[dance competition|dance-off]] scenes. Promotion for the release included performing the song live on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] and ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''. The Extended Dance Mix, also produced by Guetta, was released alongside the main single worldwide, whereas the urban remix with American rapper [[Nelly]] was released in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Background and context ==\n[[File:David Guetta One Love Tour M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Guetta during a DJ set on his One Love World Tour]]\nIn 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for \"When Love Takes Over\", the media reported that [[Columbia Records]] and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a233039/kelly-rowland-old-label-dumped-me.html |title=Kelly Rowland \"Old Label Dumped Me\" |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> However in a 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' did not sell sufficiently well.

It serves as the project's international [[lead single]] and her debut release with [[Universal Motown]]. It was co-written by American songwriter [[Rico Love]], who described the song as a \"fun and aggressive club record\" with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors. French disc jockeys and producers [[David Guetta]] and [[Sandy Vee]] produced \"Commander\" with [[synthesizer|synthesized]] [[dance music|dance]] beats that blend [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with [[electronica]] and [[house music]]. Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production, \"[[When Love Takes Over]]\", in 2009. The song was premiered at the 2010 ''[[Winter Music Conference]]'' and subsequently garnered acclaim from contemporary critics for Rowland's vocal performance as well as Guetta's musical production.\n\nJust over a month after release, it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and later peaked within the top-ten in the United Kingdom and top-twenty in Ireland and New Zealand. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named \"Commander\" the number-one summer jam of 2010 and named by [[Fitness Magazine]] as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010. The song was nominated at the [[International Dance Music Awards]] for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track. An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto, and portrays Rowland facing herself in various [[dance competition|dance-off]] scenes. Promotion for the release included performing the song live on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] and ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''. The Extended Dance Mix, also produced by Guetta, was released alongside the main single worldwide, whereas the urban remix with American rapper [[Nelly]] was released in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Background and context ==\n[[File:David Guetta One Love Tour M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Guetta during a DJ set on his One Love World Tour]]\nIn 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for \"When Love Takes Over\", the media reported that [[Columbia Records]] and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a233039/kelly-rowland-old-label-dumped-me.html |title=Kelly Rowland \"Old Label Dumped Me\" |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> However in a 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of \"When Love Takes Over\" she would go on to fire [[Mathew Knowles]].<ref name=\"EW interview\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Kelly Rowland \"My Old Label Dumped Me & Why I Had to Fire Matthew\" |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |issue=1109 |pages=43\u201345}}</ref> It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow [[Destiny's Child]] singer [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]]. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video (\"[[Why Don't You Love Me (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]\") from her album ''[[I Am...

Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodical payout. As members die, their payout entitlements devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each continuing payout increases. Typically, upon the death of the penultimate member, the scheme is wound up.\n\nTontines are regulated in Europe under the Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0083|title=EUR-Lex - 32002L0083 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}</ref> and are still common in [[France]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/international/3363847/Property-in-France-Keep-it-in-la-famille-now-and-for-ever.html|title=Property in France: Keep it in la famille now and for ever|last=Ingram|first=Miranda|date=2008-08-29|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nThe new [[Pan-European Pension]] legislation coming into force in August 2020 contains provisions which specifically pave the way for a next-generation of pension products that abide by the \u2018tontine principle\u2019 <ref> last = Hooghiemstra | first = Sebastiaan Niels | title = PEPP \u2013 Towards a Harmonized European Legislative Framework for Personal Pensions | journal = SSRN | url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2993991 | date = July 2017 </ref>.\n\nQuestionable practices by U.S. life insurers in 1906 led to the [[Armstrong Investigation]] in the United States restricting some forms of tontines. Nevertheless, in March 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that tontines were getting fresh consideration as a way for people to get steady retirement income.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/retirement/tontines-retirement-annuity.html?_r=0 |title=When Others Die, Tontine Investors Win |website=nytimes.com |date=2017-03-24 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe investment plan is named after [[Naples|Neapolitan]] banker [[Lorenzo de Tonti]], who is popularly credited with inventing it in [[France]] in 1653. In fact, he more probably merely modified existing Italian investment schemes,<ref>Jennings; Swanson; Trout (1988), p. 107</ref> while another precursor was a proposal put to the Senate of [[Lisbon]] by Nicolas Bourey in 1641.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McKeever|first=Kent|date=10 February 2017 |title=A Tontine before Lorenzo de Tonti's!

The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states.

Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].
