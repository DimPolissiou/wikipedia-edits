HMB appears to stimulate muscle protein synthesis through an up-regulation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a signaling cascade involved in coordination of translation initiation of muscle protein synthesis [2, 4]. Additionally, HMB may have antagonistic effects on the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, a system that degrades intracellular proteins [5, 6]. Evidence also suggests that HMB promotes myogenic proliferation, differentiation, and cell fusion [7].&nbsp;... Exogenous HMB-FA administration has shown to increase intramuscular anabolic signaling, stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and attenuate muscle protein breakdown in humans [2]. <!--Therefore, the anabolic and anti-catabolic properties of HMB-FA offer an appealing nutritional supplement for athletes participating in high-intensity, muscle damaging exercise.-->| hdl = 11449/170023 | hdl-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson DJ, Hossain T, Hill DS, Phillips BE, Crossland H, Williams J, Loughna P, Churchward-Venne TA, Breen L, Phillips SM, Etheridge T, Rathmacher JA, Smith K, Szewczyk NJ, Atherton PJ | title = Effects of leucine and its metabolite \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 591 | issue = 11 | pages = 2911\u20132923 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23551944 | pmc = 3690694 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2013.253203 | quote = The stimulation of MPS through mTORc1-signalling following HMB exposure is in agreement with pre-clinical studies (Eley et al. 2008).&nbsp;... Furthermore, there was clear divergence in the amplitude of phosphorylation for 4EBP1 (at Thr37/46 and Ser65/Thr70) and p70S6K (Thr389) in response to both Leu and HMB, with the latter showing more pronounced and sustained phosphorylation.&nbsp;...  Nonetheless, as the overall MPS response was similar, this cellular signalling distinction did not translate into statistically distinguishable anabolic effects in our primary outcome measure of MPS.&nbsp;... Interestingly, although orally supplied HMB produced no increase in plasma insulin, it caused a depression in MPB (\u221257%). Normally, postprandial decreases in MPB (of ~50%) are attributed to the nitrogen-sparing effects of insulin since clamping insulin at post-absorptive concentrations (5&nbsp;\u03bcU&nbsp;ml<sup>\u22121</sup>) while continuously infusing AAs (18&nbsp;g&nbsp;h<sup>\u22121</sup>) did not suppress MPB (Greenhaff et al. 2008), which is why we chose not to measure MPB in the Leu group, due to an anticipated hyperinsulinaemia (Fig. 3C). Thus, HMB reduces MPB in a fashion similar to, but independent of, insulin. These findings are in-line with reports of the anti-catabolic effects of HMB suppressing MPB in pre-clinical models, via attenuating proteasomal-mediated proteolysis in response to LPS (Eley et al. 2008).}}</ref>\n\n==Dietary leucine==\nAs a [[food additive]], L-leucine has [[E number]] '''E641''' and is classified as a [[flavor enhancer]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Winter|first1=Ruth|title=A consumer's dictionary of food additives|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0307408921|edition=7th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307408921}}</ref>\n\n===Requirements===\nThe Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for [[essential amino acid]]s in 2002.

HMB appears to stimulate muscle protein synthesis through an up-regulation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a signaling cascade involved in coordination of translation initiation of muscle protein synthesis [2, 4]. Additionally, HMB may have antagonistic effects on the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, a system that degrades intracellular proteins [5, 6]. Evidence also suggests that HMB promotes myogenic proliferation, differentiation, and cell fusion [7].&nbsp;... Exogenous HMB-FA administration has shown to increase intramuscular anabolic signaling, stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and attenuate muscle protein breakdown in humans [2]. <!--Therefore, the anabolic and anti-catabolic properties of HMB-FA offer an appealing nutritional supplement for athletes participating in high-intensity, muscle damaging exercise.-->| hdl = 11449/170023 | hdl-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson DJ, Hossain T, Hill DS, Phillips BE, Crossland H, Williams J, Loughna P, Churchward-Venne TA, Breen L, Phillips SM, Etheridge T, Rathmacher JA, Smith K, Szewczyk NJ, Atherton PJ | title = Effects of leucine and its metabolite \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 591 | issue = 11 | pages = 2911\u20132923 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23551944 | pmc = 3690694 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2013.253203 | quote = The stimulation of MPS through mTORc1-signalling following HMB exposure is in agreement with pre-clinical studies (Eley et al. 2008).&nbsp;... Furthermore, there was clear divergence in the amplitude of phosphorylation for 4EBP1 (at Thr37/46 and Ser65/Thr70) and p70S6K (Thr389) in response to both Leu and HMB, with the latter showing more pronounced and sustained phosphorylation.&nbsp;...  Nonetheless, as the overall MPS response was similar, this cellular signalling distinction did not translate into statistically distinguishable anabolic effects in our primary outcome measure of MPS.&nbsp;... Interestingly, although orally supplied HMB produced no increase in plasma insulin, it caused a depression in MPB (\u221257%). Normally, postprandial decreases in MPB (of ~50%) are attributed to the nitrogen-sparing effects of insulin since clamping insulin at post-absorptive concentrations (5&nbsp;\u03bcU&nbsp;ml<sup>\u22121</sup>) while continuously infusing AAs (18&nbsp;g&nbsp;h<sup>\u22121</sup>) did not suppress MPB (Greenhaff et al. 2008), which is why we chose not to measure MPB in the Leu group, due to an anticipated hyperinsulinaemia (Fig. 3C). Thus, HMB reduces MPB in a fashion similar to, but independent of, insulin. These findings are in-line with reports of the anti-catabolic effects of HMB suppressing MPB in pre-clinical models, via attenuating proteasomal-mediated proteolysis in response to LPS (Eley et al. 2008).}}</ref>\n\n==Dietary leucine==\nAs a [[food additive]], L-leucine has [[E number]] '''E641''' and is classified as a [[flavor enhancer]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Winter|first1=Ruth|title=A consumer's dictionary of food additives|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0307408921|edition=7th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307408921}}</ref>\n\n===Requirements===\nThe Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for [[essential amino acid]]s in 2002.

Written by [[Bryan Woods]], [[Scott Beck]] and Krasinski, the plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and raise their children in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by blind [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods had begun developing a story that would lead into the film at college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. The film drew inspiration from other films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It became a major box office success, grossing over $340 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, direction, acting, and sound design. It was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018.\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she later won. It was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|72nd BAFTA Awards]] as well for a [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[91st Academy Awards]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2020, with Krasinski again directing and the main cast also returning.\n\n==Plot==\nThroughout the year 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been annihilated by sightless extraterrestrial creatures. The creatures, which attack anything that makes noise, have hypersensitive hearing and indestructible, armored skin.\n\nThe Abbott family{{spnd}}wife Evelyn, husband Lee, [[Birth defect|congenitally]] deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau{{spnd}}silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. Going barefoot while out in the open, the family communicates in [[American Sign Language]]. Four-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau activates the toy when the family is walking home while crossing a bridge, giving away his location to a nearby creature that kills him before Lee can save him.\n\n[[File:House used as the Abbott family home in A Quiet Place.jpg|thumb|right|The house used as the Abbotts' in the film|alt=A white wooden three-story house with a scaled mansard roof, lit by the sun from the left, viewed at a three-quarters angle amid a landscape with wooded hills in the background under a clear blue sky]]\nOver a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee fruitlessly tries to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him how to fish, while Regan abandons her mother to visit Beau's memorial. Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe from the creatures in the presence of louder and constant sounds, as the sounds mask over their voices and do not attract creatures. Marcus then reveals that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and needs her father to tell her he still loves her.\n\nAlone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to their basement, she accidentally steps on an exposed nail with her right foot. In pain, Evelyn accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].\n\nArriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Arriving at the house, Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son and, along with Evelyn, makes his way to their improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn then falls asleep but soon wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature has found its way inside the basement hideaway.\n\nRegan, hurrying back to the farm, takes refuge atop a [[grain silo]] with Marcus, lighting a fire to alert their father of their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door then suddenly gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The sound of the door falling distracts the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it targets Marcus and Regan. Regan, who has jumped in after Marcus, [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency sound that drives it away. The children proceed to escape from the silo and reunite with their father.\n\nThe creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he loves her and always has, before yelling to draw the creature away from his children; the creature, hearing Lee's voice, attacks and kills him. Regan and Marcus roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the farmhouse.\n\nThe four retreat to the house's basement.<ref name=METRO2 /> When the creature returns, Regan, who realizes that the sound made by the implant distresses the creature,<ref name=METRO2 /> switches the device back on and places it on a nearby microphone, amplifying the [[audio feedback|feedback]]. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, allowing Evelyn to fatally shoot it with a [[shotgun]]. The family views a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitor, showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, the members of the family arm themselves and prepare to fight back.<ref name=METRO2>{{cite news |last=Wakeman |first=Gregory |url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/a-quiet-place-ending |title='A Quiet Place' has one of the coolest movie endings ever |work=[[Metro (U.S. newspaper)|Metro]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Lee Abbott, an engineer, husband of Evelyn, and the father of Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott.

Written by [[Bryan Woods]], [[Scott Beck]] and Krasinski, the plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and raise their children in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by blind [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods had begun developing a story that would lead into the film at college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. The film drew inspiration from other films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It became a major box office success, grossing over $340 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, direction, acting, and sound design. It was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018.\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she later won. It was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|72nd BAFTA Awards]] as well for a [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[91st Academy Awards]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2020, with Krasinski again directing and the main cast also returning.\n\n==Plot==\nThroughout the year 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been annihilated by sightless extraterrestrial creatures. The creatures, which attack anything that makes noise, have hypersensitive hearing and indestructible, armored skin.\n\nThe Abbott family{{spnd}}wife Evelyn, husband Lee, congenitally deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau{{spnd}}silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. Going barefoot while out in the open, the family communicates in [[American Sign Language]]. Four-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau activates the toy when the family is walking home while crossing a bridge, giving away his location to a nearby creature that kills him before Lee can save him.\n\n[[File:House used as the Abbott family home in A Quiet Place.jpg|thumb|right|The house used as the Abbotts' in the film|alt=A white wooden three-story house with a scaled mansard roof, lit by the sun from the left, viewed at a three-quarters angle amid a landscape with wooded hills in the background under a clear blue sky]]\nOver a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee fruitlessly tries to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him how to fish, while Regan abandons her mother to visit Beau's memorial. Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe from the creatures in the presence of louder and constant sounds, as the sounds mask over their voices and do not attract creatures. Marcus then reveals that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and needs her father to tell her he still loves her.\n\nAlone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to their basement, she accidentally steps on an exposed nail with her right foot. In pain, Evelyn accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].\n\nArriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Arriving at the house, Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son and, along with Evelyn, makes his way to their improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn then falls asleep but soon wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature has found its way inside the basement hideaway.\n\nRegan, hurrying back to the farm, takes refuge atop a [[grain silo]] with Marcus, lighting a fire to alert their father of their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door then suddenly gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The sound of the door falling distracts the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it targets Marcus and Regan. Regan, who has jumped in after Marcus, [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency sound that drives it away. The children proceed to escape from the silo and reunite with their father.\n\nThe creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he loves her and always has, before yelling to draw the creature away from his children; the creature, hearing Lee's voice, attacks and kills him. Regan and Marcus roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the farmhouse.\n\nThe four retreat to the house's basement.<ref name=METRO2 /> When the creature returns, Regan, who realizes that the sound made by the implant distresses the creature,<ref name=METRO2 /> switches the device back on and places it on a nearby microphone, amplifying the [[audio feedback|feedback]]. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, allowing Evelyn to fatally shoot it with a [[shotgun]]. The family views a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitor, showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, the members of the family arm themselves and prepare to fight back.<ref name=METRO2>{{cite news |last=Wakeman |first=Gregory |url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/a-quiet-place-ending |title='A Quiet Place' has one of the coolest movie endings ever |work=[[Metro (U.S. newspaper)|Metro]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Lee Abbott, an engineer, husband of Evelyn, and the father of Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott.

The denseness of the domain is necessary and sufficient for the existence of the adjoint (if {{math|X}} and {{math|Y}} are Hilbert spaces) and the transpose; see the sections below. \n\nIf {{math|''T'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is closed, densely defined and [[continuous operator|continuous]] on its domain, then its domain is all of {{mvar|X}}.<ref>Suppose ''f<sub>j</sub>'' is a sequence in the domain of {{mvar|T}} that converges to {{math|''g'' \u2208 ''X''}}.

Hence, {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp; {{=}} ''g''}}, and the domain of {{mvar|T}} is closed.</ref>\n\nA densely defined operator {{mvar|T}} on a [[Hilbert space]] {{mvar|H}} is called '''bounded from below''' if {{math|''T'' + ''a''}} is a positive operator for some real number {{mvar|a}}.

We equip <math>C([0,1])</math> with the supremum norm, <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}</math>, making it a Banach space. Define the classical differentiation operator {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}} : ''C''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1]) \u2192 ''C''([0, 1])}} by the usual formula:\n\n: <math> \\left (\\frac{d}{dx}f \\right )(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}, \\qquad \\forall x \\in [0, 1].</math>\n\nEvery differentiable function is continuous, so {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1]) \u2286 ''C''([0, 1])}}. We claim that {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}} : ''C''([0, 1]) \u2192 ''C''([0, 1])}} is a well-defined unbounded operator, with domain {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1])}}. For this, we need to show that <math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math> is linear and then, for example, exhibit some <math>\\{f_n\\}_n \\subset C^1([0,1])</math> such that <math>\\|f_n\\|_\\infty=1</math> and <math>\\sup_n \\|\\frac{d}{dx} f_n\\|_\\infty=+\\infty</math>.\n\nThis is a linear operator, since a linear combination {{math|''a&thinsp;f&thinsp;'' + ''bg''}} of two continuously differentiable functions {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;, ''g''}} is also continuously differentiable, and\n\n:<math>\\left (\\tfrac{d}{dx} \\right )(af+bg)= a \\left (\\tfrac{d}{dx}  f \\right ) + b \\left (\\tfrac{d}{dx} g \\right ).</math>\n\nThe operator is not bounded.

At the same time, it can be bounded as an operator {{math|''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} for other pairs of Banach spaces {{math|''X'', ''Y''}}, and also as operator {{math|''Z'' \u2192 ''Z''}} for some topological vector spaces {{mvar|Z}}.{{clarify|reason=Why the shift from Banach spaces to topological vector spaces?

Let {{math|''T'' : ''D''(''T'')  \u2286 ''H''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} be an unbounded operator between Hilbert spaces.\n\nFirst, it can be defined in a way analogous to how one defines the adjoint of a bounded operator. Namely, the adjoint {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup> : ''D''(''T''&thinsp;<sup>*</sup>)  \u2286  ''H''<sub>2</sub> \u2192 ''H''<sub>1</sub>}} of {{mvar|T}} is defined as an operator with the property:\n\n:<math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle_2 = \\left \\langle x \\mid T^*y \\right \\rangle_1, \\qquad x \\in D(T).</math>\n\nMore precisely, {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is defined in the following way. If {{mvar|y \u2208 ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} is such that <math>x \\mapsto \\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle</math> is a continuous linear functional on the domain of {{mvar|T}}, then ''y'' is declared to be an element of {{math|''D''(''T''&thinsp;<sup>*</sup>)}} , and after extending the linear functional to the whole space via the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]], it is possible to find a ''z'' in ''H''<sub>1</sub> such that\n\n:<math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle_2 = \\langle x \\mid z \\rangle_1, \\qquad x \\in D(T),</math>\n\nsince the dual of a Hilbert space can be identified with the set of linear functionals given by the inner product. For each {{math|''y'', ''z''}} is uniquely determined if and only if the so extended linear functional was densely defined; i.e., if {{mvar|T}} is densely defined. Finally, letting {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''y'' {{=}} ''z''}} completes the construction of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}}.<ref>Verifying that {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is linear trivial.</ref> Note that {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} exists if and only if {{mvar|T}} is densely defined.\n\nBy definition, the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} consists of elements {{mvar|y}} in {{math|''H''<sub>2</sub>}} such that <math>x \\mapsto \\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle</math> is continuous on the domain of {{mvar|T}}. Consequently, the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} could be anything; it could be trivial (i.e., contains only zero).<ref name=\"BSU-3.2\">{{ harvnb |Berezansky|Sheftel|Us|1996| loc=Example 3.2 on page 16 }}</ref> It may happen that the domain of ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup> is a closed [[hyperplane]] and {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} vanishes everywhere on the domain.<ref name=\"RS-252\">{{ harvnb |Reed|Simon|1980| loc=page 252 }}</ref><ref name=\"BSU-3.1\">{{harvnb|Berezansky|Sheftel|Us|1996|loc=Example 3.1 on page 15 }}</ref> Thus, boundedness of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} on its domain does not imply boundedness of {{mvar|T}}. On the other hand, if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is defined on the whole space then {{mvar|T}} is bounded on its domain and therefore can be extended by continuity to a bounded operator on the whole space.<ref>Proof: being closed, the everywhere defined {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is bounded, which implies boundedness of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}, the latter being the closure of {{mvar|T}}. See also {{ harv |Pedersen|1989| loc=2.3.11 }} for the case of everywhere defined {{mvar|T}}.</ref> If the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is dense, then it has its adjoint {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}.<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.5\" /> A closed densely defined operator {{mvar|T}} is bounded if and only if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is bounded.<ref>Proof: {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup> {{=}} ''T''}}. So, if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is bounded, then its adjoint {{mvar|T}} is bounded.</ref>\n\nThe other equivalent definition of the adjoint can be obtained by noticing a general fact.

The kernel of a closed operator is closed. Moreover, the kernel of a closed densely defined operator {{math|''T'' : ''H''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} coincides with the orthogonal complement of the range of the adjoint.

Since {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} has closed range, it is the case that {{math|ran(''T'') {{=}} ran(''TT''&thinsp;<sup>*</sup>)}}. Since {{math|ran(''T'')}} is dense, it suffices to show that {{math|''TT''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} has closed range.

They are more general than [[bounded operator]]s, and therefore not necessarily [[continuous function|continuous]], but they still retain nice enough properties that one can define the [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] and  (with certain assumptions) [[functional calculus]] for such operators. Many important linear operators which fail to be bounded turn out to be closed, such as the [[derivative]] and a large class of [[differential operator]]s. \n \nLet {{math|''X'', ''Y''}} be two [[Banach space]]s. A [[linear transformation|linear operator]] {{math|''A'' : ''D''(''A'') \u2282 ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is '''closed''' if for every [[sequence]] {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }} in {{math|''D''(''A'')}} [[limit of a sequence|converging]] to {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} such that {{math|''Ax<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}} one has {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''D''(''A'')}} and {{math|''Ax'' {{=}} ''y''}}. Equivalently, {{mvar|A}} is closed if its [[function graph|graph]] is [[closed set|closed]] in the [[direct sum of Banach spaces|direct sum]] {{math|''X'' \u2295 ''Y''}}.\n\nGiven a linear operator {{mvar|A}}, not necessarily closed, if the closure of its graph in {{math|''X'' \u2295 ''Y''}} happens to be the graph of some operator, that operator is called the '''closure''' of {{mvar|A}}, and we say that {{mvar|A}} is '''closable'''. Denote the closure of {{mvar|A}} by {{math|{{overline|''A''}}}}. It follows that {{mvar|A}} is the [[function (mathematics)|restriction]] of {{math|{{overline|''A''}}}} to {{math|''D''(''A'')}}.\n\nA '''core''' (or '''essential domain''') of a closable operator is a [[subset]] {{mvar|C}} of {{math|''D''(''A'')}} such that the closure of the restriction of {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|C}} is {{math|{{overline|''A''}}}}.\n\n===Basic properties===\nAny closed linear operator defined on the whole space {{mvar|X}} is bounded.  This is the [[closed graph theorem]]. Additionally, the following properties are easily checked:\n\n*If {{mvar|A}} is closed then {{math|''A'' \u2212 ''\u03bbI''}} is closed where {{mvar|\u03bb}} is a scalar and {{mvar|I}} is the [[identity function]]; \n*If {{mvar|A}} is closed, then its [[Kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] (or nullspace) is a closed subspace of {{mvar|X}};\n*If {{mvar|A}} is closed and [[injective function|injective]], then its [[inverse function|inverse]] {{math|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is also closed; \n*An operator {{mvar|A}} admits a closure if and only if for every pair of sequences {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }} and {{math|{''y<sub>n</sub>''} }} in {{math|''D''(''A'')}} both converging to {{mvar|x}}, such that both {{math|{''Ax<sub>n</sub>''} }} and {{math|{''Ay<sub>n</sub>''} }} converge, one has {{math|lim<sub>''n''</sub> ''Ax<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} lim<sub>''n''</sub> ''Ay<sub>n</sub>''}}.\n\n===Example===\nConsider the [[derivative]] operator {{math|''A'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} where {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''Y'' {{=}} ''C''([''a'', ''b''])}} is the Banach space of all [[continuous function]]s on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. If one takes its domain {{math|''D''(''A'')}} to be {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([''a'', ''b''])}}, then {{mvar|A}} is a closed operator, which is not bounded<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introductory Functional Analysis With Applications|last=Kreyszig|first=Erwin|publisher=John Wiley & Sons.

On the other hand if {{math|''D''(''A'') {{=}} [[smooth function{{!}}''C''<sup>\u221e</sup>([''a'', ''b''])]]}}, then {{mvar|A}} will no longer be closed, but it will be closable, with the closure being its extension defined on {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([''a'', ''b''])}}.\n\n== Symmetric operators and self-adjoint operators ==\n{{main|Self-adjoint operator}}\n\nAn operator ''T'' on a Hilbert space is ''symmetric'' if and only if for each ''x'' and ''y'' in the domain of {{mvar|T}} we have <math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle = \\lang x \\mid Ty \\rang</math>.

We equip <math>C([0,1])</math> with the supremum norm, <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}</math>, making it a Banach space. Define the classical differentiation operator {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}} : ''C''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1]) \u2192 ''C''([0, 1])}} by the usual formula:\n\n: <math> \\left (\\frac{d}{dx}f \\right )(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}, \\qquad \\forall x \\in [0, 1].</math>\n\nEvery differentiable function is continuous, so {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1]) \u2286 ''C''([0, 1])}}. We claim that {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}} : ''C''([0, 1]) \u2192 ''C''([0, 1])}} is a well-defined unbounded operator, with domain {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1])}}. For this, we need to show that <math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math> is linear and then, for example, exhibit some <math>\\{f_n\\}_n \\subset C^1([0,1])</math> such that <math>\\sup_n \\|\\frac{d}{dx} f_n\\|_\\infty=+\\infty</math>.\n\nThis is a linear operator, since a linear combination {{math|''a&thinsp;f&thinsp;'' + ''bg''}} of two continuously differentiable functions {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;, ''g''}} is also continuously differentiable, and\n\n:<math>\\left (\\tfrac{d}{dx} \\right )(af+bg)= a \\left (\\tfrac{d}{dx}  f \\right ) + b \\left (\\tfrac{d}{dx} g \\right ).</math>\n\nThe operator is not bounded.

At the same time, it can be bounded as an operator {{math|''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} for other pairs of Banach spaces {{math|''X'', ''Y''}}, and also as operator {{math|''Z'' \u2192 ''Z''}} for some topological vector spaces {{mvar|Z}}.{{clarify|reason=Why the shift from Banach spaces to topological vector spaces?

Let {{math|''T'' : ''D''(''T'')  \u2286 ''H''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} be an unbounded operator between Hilbert spaces.\n\nFirst, it can be defined in a way analogous to how one defines the adjoint of a bounded operator. Namely, the adjoint {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup> : ''D''(''T''&thinsp;<sup>*</sup>)  \u2286  ''H''<sub>2</sub> \u2192 ''H''<sub>1</sub>}} of {{mvar|T}} is defined as an operator with the property:\n\n:<math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle_2 = \\left \\langle x \\mid T^*y \\right \\rangle_1, \\qquad x \\in D(T).</math>\n\nMore precisely, {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is defined in the following way. If {{mvar|y \u2208 ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} is such that <math>x \\mapsto \\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle</math> is a continuous linear functional on the domain of {{mvar|T}}, then ''y'' is declared to be an element of {{math|''D''(''T''&thinsp;<sup>*</sup>)}} , and after extending the linear functional to the whole space via the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]], it is possible to find a ''z'' in ''H''<sub>1</sub> such that\n\n:<math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle_2 = \\langle x \\mid z \\rangle_1, \\qquad x \\in D(T),</math>\n\nsince the dual of a Hilbert space can be identified with the set of linear functionals given by the inner product. For each {{math|''y'', ''z''}} is uniquely determined if and only if the so extended linear functional was densely defined; i.e., if {{mvar|T}} is densely defined. Finally, letting {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''y'' {{=}} ''z''}} completes the construction of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}}.<ref>Verifying that {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is linear trivial.</ref> Note that {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} exists if and only if {{mvar|T}} is densely defined.\n\nBy definition, the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} consists of elements {{mvar|y}} in {{math|''H''<sub>2</sub>}} such that <math>x \\mapsto \\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle</math> is continuous on the domain of {{mvar|T}}. Consequently, the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} could be anything; it could be trivial (i.e., contains only zero).<ref name=\"BSU-3.2\">{{ harvnb |Berezansky|Sheftel|Us|1996| loc=Example 3.2 on page 16 }}</ref> It may happen that the domain of ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup> is a closed [[hyperplane]] and {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} vanishes everywhere on the domain.<ref name=\"RS-252\">{{ harvnb |Reed|Simon|1980| loc=page 252 }}</ref><ref name=\"BSU-3.1\">{{harvnb|Berezansky|Sheftel|Us|1996|loc=Example 3.1 on page 15 }}</ref> Thus, boundedness of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} on its domain does not imply boundedness of {{mvar|T}}. On the other hand, if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is defined on the whole space then {{mvar|T}} is bounded on its domain and therefore can be extended by continuity to a bounded operator on the whole space.<ref>Proof: being closed, the everywhere defined {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is bounded, which implies boundedness of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}, the latter being the closure of {{mvar|T}}. See also {{ harv |Pedersen|1989| loc=2.3.11 }} for the case of everywhere defined {{mvar|T}}.</ref> If the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is dense, then it has its adjoint {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}.<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.5\" /> A closed densely defined operator {{mvar|T}} is bounded if and only if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is bounded.<ref>Proof: {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup> {{=}} ''T''}}. So, if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is bounded, then its adjoint {{mvar|T}} is bounded.</ref>\n\nThe other equivalent definition of the adjoint can be obtained by noticing a general fact. Define a linear operator {{mvar|J}} as follows:<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.5\">{{ harvnb |Pedersen|1989| loc=5.1.5 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} J: H_1 \\oplus H_2 \\to H_2 \\oplus H_1 \\\\ J(x \\oplus y) = -y \\oplus x \\end{cases}</math>\n\nSince {{mvar|J}} is an isometric surjection, it is unitary. Hence: {{math|''J''(\u0393(''T''))<sup>\u22a5</sup>}} is the graph of some operator {{mvar|S}} if and only if {{mvar|T}} is densely defined.<ref name=\"BSU-12\">{{harvnb|Berezansky|Sheftel|Us|1996| loc=page 12}}</ref> A simple calculation shows that this \"some\" {{mvar|S}} satisfies:\n\n:<math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle_2 = \\langle x \\mid Sy \\rangle_1,</math>\n\nfor every {{mvar|x}} in the domain of {{mvar|T}}. Thus, {{mvar|S}} is the adjoint of {{mvar|T}}.\n\nIt follows immediately from the above definition that the adjoint {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is closed.<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.5\" /> In particular, a self-adjoint operator (i.e., {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}}) is closed. An operator {{mvar|T}} is closed and densely defined if and only if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup> {{=}} ''T''}}.<ref>Proof: If {{mvar|T}} is closed densely defined, then {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} exists and is densely defined. Thus, {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}} exists. The graph of {{mvar|T}} is dense in the graph of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}; hence, {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}. Conversely, since the existence of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}} implies that that of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, which in turn implies {{mvar|T}} is densely defined. Since {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}} is closed, {{mvar|T}} is densely defined and closed.</ref>\n\nSome well-known properties for bounded operators generalize to closed densely defined operators. The kernel of a closed operator is closed. Moreover, the kernel of a closed densely defined operator {{math|''T'' : ''H''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} coincides with the orthogonal complement of the range of the adjoint. That is,<ref>Brezis, pp. 28.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ker}(T) = \\operatorname{ran}(T^*)^\\bot.</math>\n\n[[von Neumann's theorem]] states that {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''T''}} and {{math|''TT''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} are self-adjoint, and that {{math|''I'' + ''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''T''}} and {{math|''I'' + ''TT''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} both have bounded inverses.<ref>Yoshida, pp. 200.</ref> If {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} has trivial kernel, {{mvar|T}} has dense range (by the above identity.)

Since {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} has closed range, it is the case that {{math|ran(''T'') {{=}} ran(''TT''&thinsp;<sup>*</sup>)}}. Since {{math|ran(''T'')}} is dense, it suffices to show that {{math|''TT''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} has closed range. If {{math|''TT''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>&thinsp;''f<sub>j</sub>''&thinsp;}} is convergent, then {{math|&thinsp;''f<sub>j</sub>''&thinsp;}} is convergent by the estimate since\n\n:<math>\\|T^*f_j\\|_1^2 = | \\langle T^*f_j \\mid T^*f_j \\rangle_1| \\le \\|TT^*f_j\\|_2 \\|f_j\\|_2.</math>\n\nSay, {{math|&thinsp;''f<sub>j</sub>''&thinsp; \u2192 ''g''}}.

QED</ref> (This is essentially a variant of the so-called [[closed range theorem]].) In particular, {{mvar|T}} has closed range if and only if {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}} has closed range.\n\nIn contrast to the bounded case, it is not necessary that {{math|(''TS'')<sup>\u2217</sup> {{=}} ''S''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, since, for example, it is even possible that {{math|(''TS'')<sup>\u2217</sup>}} doesn't exist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}<!-- Need a concrete example.--> This is, however, the case if, for example, {{mvar|T}} is bounded.<ref>Yoshida, pp. 195.</ref>\n\nA densely defined, closed operator {{mvar|T}} is called ''[[normal operator|normal]]'' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.11\">{{ harvnb |Pedersen|1989| loc=5.1.11 }}</ref>\n\n* {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''T'' {{=}} ''TT''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}};\n* the domain of {{mvar|T}} is equal to the domain of {{math|''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, and {{math|{{!!}}''Tx''{{!!}} {{=}} {{!!}}''T''&thinsp;<sup>\u2217</sup>''x''{{!!}}}} for every {{mvar|x}} in this domain;\n* there exist self-adjoint operators {{math|''A'', ''B''}} such that {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''A'' + ''iB''}}, {{math|''T''<sup>\u2217</sup> {{=}} ''A'' \u2013 ''iB''}}, and {{math|{{!!}}''Tx''{{!!}}<sup>2</sup>{{=}} {{!!}}''Ax''{{!!}}<sup>2</sup> + {{!!}}''Bx''{{!!}}<sup>2</sup>}} for every {{mvar|x}} in the domain of {{mvar|T}}.\n\nEvery self-adjoint operator is normal.\n\n== Transpose ==\nLet {{math|''T'' : ''B''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''B''<sub>2</sub>}} be an operator between Banach spaces.

They are more general than [[bounded operator]]s, and therefore not necessarily [[continuous function|continuous]], but they still retain nice enough properties that one can define the [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] and  (with certain assumptions) [[functional calculus]] for such operators. Many important linear operators which fail to be bounded turn out to be closed, such as the [[derivative]] and a large class of [[differential operator]]s. \n \nLet {{math|''X'', ''Y''}} be two [[Banach space]]s.

Equivalently, {{mvar|A}} is closed if its [[function graph|graph]] is [[closed set|closed]] in the [[direct sum of Banach spaces|direct sum]] {{math|''X'' \u2295 ''Y''}}.\n\nGiven a linear operator {{mvar|A}}, not necessarily closed, if the closure of its graph in {{math|''X'' \u2295 ''Y''}} happens to be the graph of some operator, that operator is called the '''closure''' of {{mvar|A}}, and we say that {{mvar|A}} is '''closable'''.

Additionally, the following properties are easily checked:\n\n*If {{mvar|A}} is closed then {{math|''A'' \u2212 ''\u03bbI''}} is closed where {{mvar|\u03bb}} is a scalar and {{mvar|I}} is the [[identity function]]; \n*If {{mvar|A}} is closed, then its [[Kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] (or nullspace) is a closed subspace of {{mvar|X}};\n*If {{mvar|A}} is closed and [[injective function|injective]], then its [[inverse function|inverse]] {{math|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is also closed; \n*An operator {{mvar|A}} admits a closure if and only if for every pair of sequences {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }} and {{math|{''y<sub>n</sub>''} }} in {{math|''D''(''A'')}} both converging to {{mvar|x}}, such that both {{math|{''Ax<sub>n</sub>''} }} and {{math|{''Ay<sub>n</sub>''} }} converge, one has {{math|lim<sub>''n''</sub> ''Ax<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} lim<sub>''n''</sub> ''Ay<sub>n</sub>''}}.\n\n===Example===\nConsider the [[derivative]] operator {{math|''A'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} where {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''Y'' {{=}} ''C''([''a'', ''b''])}} is the Banach space of all [[continuous function]]s on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. If one takes its domain {{math|''D''(''A'')}} to be {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([''a'', ''b''])}}, then {{mvar|A}} is a closed operator, which is not bounded<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introductory Functional Analysis With Applications|last=Kreyszig|first=Erwin|publisher=John Wiley & Sons. Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0-471-50731-8|location=USA|pages=294}}</ref>. On the other hand if {{math|''D''(''A'') {{=}} [[smooth function{{!}}''C''<sup>\u221e</sup>([''a'', ''b''])]]}}, then {{mvar|A}} will no longer be closed, but it will be closable, with the closure being its extension defined on {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>([''a'', ''b''])}}.\n\n== Symmetric operators and self-adjoint operators ==\n{{main|Self-adjoint operator}}\n\nAn operator ''T'' on a Hilbert space is ''symmetric'' if and only if for each ''x'' and ''y'' in the domain of {{mvar|T}} we have <math>\\langle Tx \\mid y \\rangle = \\lang x \\mid Ty \\rang</math>. A densely defined operator {{mvar|T}} is symmetric if and only if it agrees with its adjoint ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup> restricted to the domain of ''T'', in other words when ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup> is an extension of {{mvar|T}}.<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.3\">{{ harvnb |Pedersen|1989| loc=5.1.3 }}</ref>\n\nIn general, if ''T'' is densely defined and symmetric, the domain of the adjoint ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup> need not equal the domain of ''T''.

In other words: for every ''x'' in ''H'' there exist ''y'' and ''z'' in the domain of ''T'' such that {{math|''Ty'' \u2013 ''iy'' {{=}} ''x''}} and {{math|''Tz'' + ''iz'' {{=}} ''x''}}.<ref name=\"Pedersen-5.2.5\">{{ harvnb |Pedersen|1989| loc=5.2.5 }}</ref>\n\nAn operator ''T'' is ''self-adjoint'', if the two subspaces {{math|\u0393(''T'')}}, {{math|''J''(\u0393(''T''))}} are orthogonal and their sum is the whole space <math> H \\oplus H .</math><ref name=\"Pedersen-5.1.5\" />\n\nThis approach does not cover non-densely defined closed operators.

Every self-adjoint operator is densely defined, closed and symmetric. The converse holds for bounded operators but fails in general. Self-adjointness is substantially more restricting than these three properties. The famous [[Self-adjoint operator#Spectral theorem|spectral theorem]] holds for self-adjoint operators. In combination with [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups]] it shows that self-adjoint operators are precisely the infinitesimal generators of strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups, see [[Self-adjoint operator#Self-adjoint extensions in quantum mechanics]]. Such unitary groups are especially important for describing [[time evolution]] in classical and quantum mechanics.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hilbert space#Unbounded operators]]\n* [[Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem]]\n* [[Bounded operator]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{ citation | last1=Berezansky| first1=Y.M. | last2=Sheftel| first2=Z.G. | last3=Us| first3=G.F.| title=Functional analysis | volume=II | year=1996| publisher=Birkh\u00e4user }} (see Chapter 12 \"General theory of unbounded operators in Hilbert spaces\").\n*{{ citation | last1=Brezis | first1=Ha\u00efm | title=Analyse fonctionnelle &mdash; Th\u00e9orie et applications  | year=1983| publisher=Mason |place=Paris |language=French}}\n*{{springer|title=Unbounded operator|id=p/u095090}} <!--Hazewinkel, Michiel, ed.
