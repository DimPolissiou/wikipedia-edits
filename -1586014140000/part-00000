The Film revolves on an avenging love between the titular character, Florinda and the man she truly loves - Rodrigo (in the remake renamed as Ramil) but one day before their wedding, an unlikely disappearance begins with Rodrigo which causes Florinda to panic but one night she will finally find out all the dark secrets locked within their new home. Strange things start to happen and she is being haunted by strange and disturbing dreams, including a ghostly corpse of a man. She soon realizes that there is something evil lurking beneath the old house.\n\n===Installment===\nFlorinda is a final installment of The Susan Roces Cinema Collection in which genres Susan Roces' classic blockbuster suspense films turned into a four-week primetime series of the Queen of Philippine Movies.\n\n==Synopsis==\nRamil requests Florinda to help him restore his ancestral home. On their site visit, Florinda relives painful memories she once had there. It seems Ramil's mother, Do\u00f1a Cristina, greatly disapproves of her relationship with the lad, so the old lady persistently sets them apart up until her final breath. Despite his mother\u2019s refusal, Ramil decides to ask Florinda's hand in marriage. Surprisingly, even from her grave, Do\u00f1a Cristina openly expresses her displeasure. On the day of the wedding, Ramil fails to show up; immediately, Florinda goes in search. With no idea where her groom could have gone, Florinda breaks down. Mother and daughter, Criselda and Mara, finally reach Florinda's new-found home after accepting Ramil's job offer a few days back. Florinda instantly recognizes the Criselda from the past, since the said lady used to serve Ramil's family. On the other hand, upon learning about her sister Florinda's paranormal experiences, Rachelle consults an expert. To her surprise, the professional confirms that there is, in fact, a [[vengeful spirit]] residing in their new home.\n\nRachelle\u2019s friends Gladys and Archie only played a trick on her: The paranormal experience they have encountered is merely an act the two staged. On the other hand, Florinda somehow feels Do\u00f1a Cristina persistently haunting her, but she puts the thought aside. Despite the rather unusual experiences, she continues to go in search for her missing groom, thus making other people think that she is gradually losing her mind. Aware of her sister\u2019s current state, Rachelle then tries to convince Florinda to undergo psychological treatment. Instead of being thankful for her sister\u2019s support, Florinda furiously exclaims that she is not ill. Florinda finally grows convinced that there is a bothered spirit residing in her house after Caloy confirmed her story. Immediately, she consults her housemaid Criselda regarding the matter. Aside from Criselda, Florinda also informs Eric; she relays to the policeman all the information she had gathered from Caloy, including the fact that the kid saw Ramil enter the house.\n\nRachelle is starting to grow impatient of her sister who keeps on insisting about Donya Cristina's bothered soul roaming around.<ref>http://www.abs-cbn.com/tvshows.aspx</ref> It is shown at a part on the series that Criselda loved Ramil and wanted marry him. So for her, killing Florinda is the only way to marry Ramil. A killing begins to her wrath of murdering Florinda, killing Florinda and Rachelle's trusted people. When Ramil escapes from Criselda, she finds the chance to stab Florinda. But when Criselda nearly stabs Florinda, the ghost of Do\u00f1a Cristina appeared to her. In the end, Criselda goes to a mental prison, while Mara is imprisoned for being an accomplice when she helped Florinda, Rachelle and Ramil escape. Florinda is in a hospital due to the stab to her leg and refuses Ramil's offer of marriage. She makes Rachelle the caretaker of the house. When Florinda finally went out of hospital, she prays at a church and finds Caloy. To her surprise, she finally knew that Caloy was a ghost and they lived happily ever after.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n<!--Official cast billing from ABS-CBN.-->\n===Main cast===\n*[[Maricel Soriano]] as Florinda Arguelles<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=122519 www.abs-cbnnews.com, Maricel Soriano makes a grand comeback in Florinda]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*[[Jay Manalo]] as Ramil Gonzales\n*[[Cherry Pie Picache]] as Criselda Bautista\n\n===Host===\n*[[Susan Roces]] as Introducer\n\n===Supporting cast===\n*[[Roxanne Guinoo]] as Rachelle Arguelles\n*[[Nikki Gil]] as Mara Bautista\n*[[Zanjoe Marudo]] as Archie\n*[[William Martinez (actor)|William Martinez]] as Eric\n*[[Pooh (comedian)|Pooh Garcia]] as George\n*Aaron Junatas as Caloy\n*Shirley Fuentes as Sally\n\n===Special participation===\n*Carla Martinez as Do\u00f1a Cristina Gonzales\n\n==Award==\n*2010 PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Drama Actress\" - Maricel Soriano\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of programs previously aired by ABS-CBN]]\n*[[Sineserye Presents]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090911033429/http://now.abs-cbn.com/shows-drama.aspx?showid=698&cat=1 Florinda] [[The Filipino Channel|TFC Now]]\n*{{official website|http://www.abs-cbn.com/Weekdays/article/4785/florinda/Sineserye-Presents-Susan-Roces-Cinema-Collection-Florinda.aspx}}\n* {{imdb title|1166721}}\n\n{{ABS-CBN Adaptations (Local Films)}}\n{{ABS-CBN drama series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Florinda (Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:ABS-CBN drama series]]\n[[Category:Philippine horror fiction television series]]\n[[Category:Mystery television series]]\n[[Category:2009 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 Philippine television series endings]]\n[[Category:Television series by Dreamscape Entertainment Television]]\n[[Category:Philippine drama television series]]\n[[Category:Live action television programs based on films]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television|\n| show_name = Sineserye Presents: Florinda\n| image = FlorindaABS-CBN.jpg\n| caption = \n| picture_format = [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n| genre = [[Drama]], [[Horror film|Horror]]\n| runtime = \n| creator = Rico Bello Omagap\n| director = Rahyan Carlos<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Showbiz&p=50&type=2&sec=58&aid=20080123146 Rahyan Carlos to direct 'Sineserye Presents: Florinda']</ref>\n| executive_producer = [[Susan Roces]]\n| starring = [[Maricel Soriano]]\n| theme_music_composer = \n| opentheme = \n| endtheme = \n| country = [[Philippines]]\n| language = [[Filipino language|Filipino]]\n| location = Philippines\n| network = [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]\n| company = [[Dreamscape Entertainment Television]]\n| first_aired = {{start date|2009|9|7}}\n| last_aired = {{end date|2009|10|2}}\n| num_episodes = 20\n| website  = http://www.abs-cbn.com/Weekdays/article/4785/florinda/Sineserye-Presents-Susan-Roces-Cinema-Collection-Floprinda.aspx\n| num_seasons = \n| channel = \n| first_run = \n| released = \n}}\n'''''Florinda''''' is an [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] weekly [[mini-series]] format adapted from the movie of the same title originally starred by [[Susan Roces]] in 1973.

A function that is not monotonic]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''monotonic function''' (or '''monotone function''') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between [[List of order structures in mathematics|ordered sets]] that preserves or reverses the given [[order relation|order]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|last2=Nicholson|first2=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|edition=5th|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MonotonicFunction.html|title=Monotonic Function|last=Stover|first=Christopher|website=Wolfram MathWorld|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Monotone_function|title=Monotone function|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> This concept first arose in [[calculus]], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of [[order theory]].\n\n== Monotonicity in calculus and analysis ==\nIn [[calculus]], a function <math>f</math> defined on a [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] with real values is called '''monotonic''' if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing.<ref name=\":1\" /> That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.\n\nA function is called '''monotonically increasing''' (also '''increasing''' or '''non-decreasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />), if for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> such that <math>x \\leq y</math> one has  <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\leq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so <math>f</math> preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called '''monotonically decreasing''' (also '''decreasing''' or '''non-increasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />) if, whenever <math>x \\leq y</math>, then <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\geq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so it ''reverses'' the order (see Figure 2).\n\nIf the order <math>\\leq</math> in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order <math><</math>, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called '''strictly increasing'''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called '''strictly decreasing'''.<ref name=\":0\" /> A function may be called '''strictly monotone''' if it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Functions that are strictly monotone are [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] (because for <math>x</math> not equal to <math>y</math>, either <math>x < y</math> or <math>x > y</math> and so, by monotonicity, either <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) < f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math> or <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) > f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, thus <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\neq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>.)\n\nIf it is not clear that \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are taken to include the possibility of repeating the same value at successive arguments, one may use the terms '''weakly monotone''', '''weakly increasing''' and '''weakly decreasing''' to stress this possibility.\n\nThe terms \"non-decreasing\" and \"non-increasing\" should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications \"not decreasing\" and \"not increasing\". For example, the function of figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.\n\nA function <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right)</math> is said to be '''absolutely monotonic''' over an interval <math>\\left(a, b\\right)</math> if the derivatives of all orders of <math>f</math> are [[nonnegative]] or all [[nonpositive]] at all points on the interval.\n\n=== Inverse of function ===\n\nA function that is monotonic, but not strictly monotonic, and thus constant on an interval, doesn't have an inverse.  This is because in order for a function to have an inverse there needs to be a one-to-one mapping from the range to the domain of the function, since a monotonic function has some values that are constant in its domain, this means that there would be more than one value in the range that maps to this constant value.\n\nHowever, a function y=g(x) that is strictly monotonic, has an inverse function such that x=h(x) because there is guaranteed to always be a one-to-one mapping from range to domain of the function.  Also, a function can be said to be strictly monotonic on a range of values, and thus have an inverse on that range of value.  For example, if y=g(x) is strictly monotonic on the range [a,b], then it has an inverse x=h(y) on the range [g(a), g(b)], but we cannot say that the entire range of the function has an inverse.\n\nNote, some textbooks mistakenly state that an inverse exists for a monotonic function, when they really mean that an inverse exists for a strictly monotonic function.\n\n=== Monotonic transformation ===\n\nThe term '''monotonic transformation''' (or '''monotone transformation''') can also possibly cause some confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a [[utility function]] being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also [[monotone preferences]]).<ref>See the section on Cardinal Versus Ordinal Utility in {{harvtxt|Simon|Blume|1994}}.</ref> In this context, what we are calling a \"monotonic transformation\" is, more accurately, called a \"positive monotonic transformation\", in order to distinguish it from a \u201cnegative monotonic transformation,\u201d which reverses the order of the numbers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Varian |first=Hal R. |title=Intermediate Microeconomics |edition=8th |year=2010 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=56 |isbn=9780393934243}}</ref>\n\n=== Some basic applications and results ===\nThe following properties are true for a monotonic function <math>f\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>:\n*<math>f</math> has [[limit of a function|limits]] from the right and from the left at every point of its [[Domain of a function|domain]];\n*<math>f</math> has a limit at positive or negative infinity (&thinsp;<math>\\pm\\infty</math>&thinsp;) of either a real number, <math>\\infty</math>, or <math>\\left(-\\infty\\right)</math>.\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[jump discontinuity|jump discontinuities]];\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[countable|countably]] many [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in its domain.  The discontinuities, however, do not necessarily consist of isolated points and may even be dense in an interval (''a'',''b'').\n\nThese properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Some more facts about these functions are:\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>I</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[derivative|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]] on <math>I</math>, i.e. the set of numbers <math>x</math> in <math>I</math> such that <math>f</math> is not differentiable in <math>x</math> has [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measure zero]]. In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see [[Cantor function]].\n*if this set is countable, then <math>f</math> if absolutely continuous.\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an interval <math>\\left[a, b\\right]</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]].\n\nAn important application of monotonic functions is in [[probability theory]]. If <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]], its [[cumulative distribution function]] <math>F_X\\!\\left(x\\right) = \\text{Prob}\\!\\left(X \\leq x\\right)</math> is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nA function is ''[[unimodal function|unimodal]]'' if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the ''[[Mode (statistics)|mode]]'') and then monotonically decreasing.\n\nWhen <math>f</math> is a ''strictly monotonic'' function, then <math>f</math> is [[Injective function|injective]] on its domain, and if <math>T</math> is the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of <math>f</math>, then there is an [[inverse function]] on <math>T</math> for <math>f</math>.\n\n== Monotonicity in topology ==\n\nA map ''<math>f: X \\rightarrow Y</math>'' is said to be '''monotone''' if each of its fibers is connected i.e. for each element ''<math>y</math>'' in <math>Y</math> the (possibly empty) set <math>f^{-1}(y)</math> is connected.\n\n== Monotonicity in functional analysis ==\n\nIn [[functional analysis]] on a [[topological vector space]] <math>X</math>, a (possibly non-linear) operator <math>T: X \\rightarrow X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone operator''' if\n\n:<math>(Tu - Tv, u - v) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall u,v \\in X.</math>\n\n[[Kachurovskii's theorem]] shows that [[convex function]]s on [[Banach space]]s have monotonic operators as their derivatives.\n\nA subset <math>G</math> of <math>X \\times X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone set''' if for every pair <math>[u_1, w_1]</math> and <math>[u_2, w_2]</math> in <math>G</math>,\n\n:<math>(w_1 - w_2, u_1 - u_2) \\geq 0.</math>\n\n<math>G</math> is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion.  The graph of a monotone operator <math>G(T)</math> is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if its graph is a '''maximal monotone set'''.\n\n== Monotonicity in order theory ==\n\nOrder theory deals with arbitrary [[partially ordered set]]s and [[preorder|preordered sets]] as a generalization of real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not [[total order|total]]. Furthermore, the [[strict order|strict]] relations < and > are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.\n\nLetting \u2264 denote the partial order relation of any partially ordered set, a '''monotone''' function, also called '''isotone''', or '''{{visible anchor|order-preserving}}''', satisfies the property\n\n: ''x'' \u2264 ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''f''(''y''),\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.\n\nThe [[duality (order theory)|dual]] notion is often called '''antitone''', '''anti-monotone''', or '''order-reversing'''. Hence, an antitone function ''f'' satisfies the property\n\n: ''x'' \u2264 ''y'' implies ''f''(''y'') \u2264 ''f''(''x''),\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain.\n\nA [[constant function]] is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if ''f'' is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of ''f'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then ''f'' must be constant.\n\nMonotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are [[order embedding]]s (functions for which ''x'' \u2264 ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''f''(''y'')) and [[order isomorphism]]s ([[surjective]] order embeddings).\n\n== Monotonicity in the context of search algorithms ==\nIn the context of [[search algorithm]]s monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to [[heuristic function]]s.  A heuristic ''h(n)'' is monotonic if, for every node ''n'' and every successor ''n''' of ''n'' generated by any action ''a'', the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''n'' is no greater than the step cost of getting to '' n' '' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from '' n' '',\n\n:<math>h(n) \\leq c(n, a, n') + h(n').</math>\n\nThis is a form of [[triangle inequality]], with ''n'', ''n''', and the goal ''G<sub>n</sub>'' closest to ''n''.  Because every monotonic heuristic is also [[admissible heuristic|admissible]], monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility.  Some [[heuristic algorithm]]s such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can be proven [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|optimal]] provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.<ref>Conditions for optimality:  Admissibility and consistency pg. 94-95 {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2010}}.</ref>\n\n== Boolean functions ==\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n| [[File:Hasse3 x impl y and z.svg|thumb|With the nonmonotonic function \"if ''a'' then both ''b'' and ''c''\", {{color|#c00000|false}} nodes appear above {{color|#00c000|true}} nodes.]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n| [[File:Hasse3 ge2.svg|thumb|Hasse diagram of the monotonic function \"at least two of ''a'',''b'',''c'' hold\". Colors indicate function output values.]]\n|}\nIn [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a monotonic function is one such that for all ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> in {0,1}, if ''a''<sub>1</sub> \u2264 ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub> \u2264 ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2264 ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> (i.e. the Cartesian product {0, 1}<sup>''n''</sup> is ordered [[Coordinatewise order|coordinatewise]]), then f(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2264 f(''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>). In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that an ''n''-ary Boolean function is monotonic when its representation as an [[hypercube|''n''-cube]] labelled with truth values has no upward edge from ''true'' to ''false''.  (This labelled [[Hasse diagram]] is the [[Duality (mathematics)#Dimension-reversing dualities|dual]] of the function's labelled [[Venn diagram]], which is the more common representation for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2264 3}}.)\n\nThe monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' and ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (in particular ''[[negation|not]]'' is forbidden).

A function that is not monotonic]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''monotonic function''' (or '''monotone function''') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between [[List of order structures in mathematics|ordered sets]] that preserves or reverses the given [[order relation|order]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|last2=Nicholson|first2=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|edition=5th|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MonotonicFunction.html|title=Monotonic Function|last=Stover|first=Christopher|website=Wolfram MathWorld|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Monotone_function|title=Monotone function|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> This concept first arose in [[calculus]], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of [[order theory]].\n\n== Monotonicity in calculus and analysis ==\nIn [[calculus]], a function <math>f</math> defined on a [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] with real values is called '''monotonic''' if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing.<ref name=\":1\" /> That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.\n\nA function is called '''monotonically increasing''' (also '''increasing''' or '''non-decreasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />), if for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> such that <math>x \\leq y</math> one has  <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\leq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so <math>f</math> preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called '''monotonically decreasing''' (also '''decreasing''' or '''non-increasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />) if, whenever <math>x \\leq y</math>, then <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\geq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so it ''reverses'' the order (see Figure 2).\n\nIf the order <math>\\leq</math> in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order <math><</math>, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called '''strictly increasing'''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called '''strictly decreasing'''.<ref name=\":0\" /> A function may be called '''strictly monotone''' if it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Functions that are strictly monotone are [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] (because for <math>x</math> not equal to <math>y</math>, either <math>x < y</math> or <math>x > y</math> and so, by monotonicity, either <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) < f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math> or <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) > f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, thus <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\neq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>.)\n\nIf it is not clear that \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are taken to include the possibility of repeating the same value at successive arguments, one may use the terms '''weakly monotone''', '''weakly increasing''' and '''weakly decreasing''' to stress this possibility.\n\nThe terms \"non-decreasing\" and \"non-increasing\" should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications \"not decreasing\" and \"not increasing\". For example, the function of figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.\n\nA function <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right)</math> is said to be '''absolutely monotonic''' over an interval <math>\\left(a, b\\right)</math> if the derivatives of all orders of <math>f</math> are [[nonnegative]] or all [[nonpositive]] at all points on the interval.\n\n=== Inverse of function ===\n\nA function that is monotonic, but not strictly monotonic, and thus constant on an interval, doesn't have an inverse.  This is because in order for a function to have an inverse there needs to be a one-to-one mapping from the range to the domain of the function, since a monotonic function has some values that are constant in its domain, this means that there would be more than one value in the range that maps to this constant value.\n\nHowever, a function y=g(x) that is strictly monotonic, has an inverse function such that x=h(x) because there is guaranteed to always be a one-to-one mapping from range to domain of the function.  Also, a function can be said to be strictly monotonic on a range of values, and thus have an inverse on that range of value.  For example, if y=g(x) is strictly monotonic on the range [a,b], then it has an inverse x=h(y) on the range [g(a), g(b)], but we cannot say the the entire range of the function has an inverse.\n\nNote, some textbooks mistakenly state that an inverse exists for a monotonic function, when they really mean that an inverse exists for a strictly monotonic function.\n\n=== Monotonic transformation ===\n\nThe term '''monotonic transformation''' (or '''monotone transformation''') can also possibly cause some confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a [[utility function]] being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also [[monotone preferences]]).<ref>See the section on Cardinal Versus Ordinal Utility in {{harvtxt|Simon|Blume|1994}}.</ref> In this context, what we are calling a \"monotonic transformation\" is, more accurately, called a \"positive monotonic transformation\", in order to distinguish it from a \u201cnegative monotonic transformation,\u201d which reverses the order of the numbers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Varian |first=Hal R. |title=Intermediate Microeconomics |edition=8th |year=2010 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=56 |isbn=9780393934243}}</ref>\n\n=== Some basic applications and results ===\nThe following properties are true for a monotonic function <math>f\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>:\n*<math>f</math> has [[limit of a function|limits]] from the right and from the left at every point of its [[Domain of a function|domain]];\n*<math>f</math> has a limit at positive or negative infinity (&thinsp;<math>\\pm\\infty</math>&thinsp;) of either a real number, <math>\\infty</math>, or <math>\\left(-\\infty\\right)</math>.\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[jump discontinuity|jump discontinuities]];\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[countable|countably]] many [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in its domain.  The discontinuities, however, do not necessarily consist of isolated points and may even be dense in an interval (''a'',''b'').\n\nThese properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Some more facts about these functions are:\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>I</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[derivative|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]] on <math>I</math>, i.e. the set of numbers <math>x</math> in <math>I</math> such that <math>f</math> is not differentiable in <math>x</math> has [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measure zero]]. In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see [[Cantor function]].\n*if this set is countable, then <math>f</math> if absolutely continuous.\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an interval <math>\\left[a, b\\right]</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]].\n\nAn important application of monotonic functions is in [[probability theory]]. If <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]], its [[cumulative distribution function]] <math>F_X\\!\\left(x\\right) = \\text{Prob}\\!\\left(X \\leq x\\right)</math> is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nA function is ''[[unimodal function|unimodal]]'' if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the ''[[Mode (statistics)|mode]]'') and then monotonically decreasing.\n\nWhen <math>f</math> is a ''strictly monotonic'' function, then <math>f</math> is [[Injective function|injective]] on its domain, and if <math>T</math> is the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of <math>f</math>, then there is an [[inverse function]] on <math>T</math> for <math>f</math>.\n\n== Monotonicity in topology ==\n\nA map ''<math>f: X \\rightarrow Y</math>'' is said to be '''monotone''' if each of its fibers is connected i.e. for each element ''<math>y</math>'' in <math>Y</math> the (possibly empty) set <math>f^{-1}(y)</math> is connected.\n\n== Monotonicity in functional analysis ==\n\nIn [[functional analysis]] on a [[topological vector space]] <math>X</math>, a (possibly non-linear) operator <math>T: X \\rightarrow X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone operator''' if\n\n:<math>(Tu - Tv, u - v) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall u,v \\in X.</math>\n\n[[Kachurovskii's theorem]] shows that [[convex function]]s on [[Banach space]]s have monotonic operators as their derivatives.\n\nA subset <math>G</math> of <math>X \\times X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone set''' if for every pair <math>[u_1, w_1]</math> and <math>[u_2, w_2]</math> in <math>G</math>,\n\n:<math>(w_1 - w_2, u_1 - u_2) \\geq 0.</math>\n\n<math>G</math> is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion.  The graph of a monotone operator <math>G(T)</math> is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if its graph is a '''maximal monotone set'''.\n\n== Monotonicity in order theory ==\n\nOrder theory deals with arbitrary [[partially ordered set]]s and [[preorder|preordered sets]] as a generalization of real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not [[total order|total]]. Furthermore, the [[strict order|strict]] relations < and > are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.\n\nLetting \u2264 denote the partial order relation of any partially ordered set, a '''monotone''' function, also called '''isotone''', or '''{{visible anchor|order-preserving}}''', satisfies the property\n\n: ''x'' \u2264 ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''f''(''y''),\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.\n\nThe [[duality (order theory)|dual]] notion is often called '''antitone''', '''anti-monotone''', or '''order-reversing'''. Hence, an antitone function ''f'' satisfies the property\n\n: ''x'' \u2264 ''y'' implies ''f''(''y'') \u2264 ''f''(''x''),\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain.\n\nA [[constant function]] is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if ''f'' is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of ''f'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then ''f'' must be constant.\n\nMonotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are [[order embedding]]s (functions for which ''x'' \u2264 ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''f''(''y'')) and [[order isomorphism]]s ([[surjective]] order embeddings).\n\n== Monotonicity in the context of search algorithms ==\nIn the context of [[search algorithm]]s monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to [[heuristic function]]s.  A heuristic ''h(n)'' is monotonic if, for every node ''n'' and every successor ''n''' of ''n'' generated by any action ''a'', the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''n'' is no greater than the step cost of getting to '' n' '' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from '' n' '',\n\n:<math>h(n) \\leq c(n, a, n') + h(n').</math>\n\nThis is a form of [[triangle inequality]], with ''n'', ''n''', and the goal ''G<sub>n</sub>'' closest to ''n''.  Because every monotonic heuristic is also [[admissible heuristic|admissible]], monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility.  Some [[heuristic algorithm]]s such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can be proven [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|optimal]] provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.<ref>Conditions for optimality:  Admissibility and consistency pg. 94-95 {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2010}}.</ref>\n\n== Boolean functions ==\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n| [[File:Hasse3 x impl y and z.svg|thumb|With the nonmonotonic function \"if ''a'' then both ''b'' and ''c''\", {{color|#c00000|false}} nodes appear above {{color|#00c000|true}} nodes.]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n| [[File:Hasse3 ge2.svg|thumb|Hasse diagram of the monotonic function \"at least two of ''a'',''b'',''c'' hold\". Colors indicate function output values.]]\n|}\nIn [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a monotonic function is one such that for all ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> in {0,1}, if ''a''<sub>1</sub> \u2264 ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub> \u2264 ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2264 ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> (i.e. the Cartesian product {0, 1}<sup>''n''</sup> is ordered [[Coordinatewise order|coordinatewise]]), then f(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2264 f(''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>). In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that an ''n''-ary Boolean function is monotonic when its representation as an [[hypercube|''n''-cube]] labelled with truth values has no upward edge from ''true'' to ''false''.  (This labelled [[Hasse diagram]] is the [[Duality (mathematics)#Dimension-reversing dualities|dual]] of the function's labelled [[Venn diagram]], which is the more common representation for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2264 3}}.)\n\nThe monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' and ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (in particular ''[[negation|not]]'' is forbidden). For instance \"at least two of ''a'',''b'',''c'' hold\" is a monotonic function of ''a'',''b'',''c'', since it can be written for instance as ((''a'' and ''b'') or (''a'' and ''c'') or (''b'' and ''c'')).\n\nThe number of such functions on ''n'' variables is known as the [[Dedekind number]] of ''n''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Monotone cubic interpolation]]\n* [[Pseudo-monotone operator]]\n* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] - measure of monotonicity in a set of data\n* [[Total monotonicity]]\n* [[Cyclical monotonicity]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n | last = Bartle\n | first = Robert G.\n | title = The elements of real analysis\n | edition = second\n | year = 1976\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Gr\u00e4tzer\n | first = George\n | title = Lattice theory: first concepts and distributive lattices\n | year = 1971\n | isbn = 0-7167-0442-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last       = Pemberton\n | first      = Malcolm\n |author2=Rau, Nicholas\n | title      = Mathematics for economists: an introductory textbook\n | publisher  = Manchester University Press\n | year       = 2001\n | pages      =\n | isbn       = 0-7190-3341-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Renardy, Michael  |author2=Rogers, Robert C.\n |lastauthoramp=yes |    title = An introduction to partial differential equations\n|   series = Texts in Applied Mathematics 13\n|  edition = Second\n|publisher = Springer-Verlag\n| location = New York\n|     year = 2004\n|    pages = 356\n|       isbn = 0-387-00444-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n |author1=Riesz, Frigyes  |author2=B\u00e9la Sz\u0151kefalvi-Nagy\n  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Functional Analysis\n | year = 1990\n| publisher = Courier Dover Publications\n| isbn = 978-0-486-66289-3\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last=Russell |first=Stuart J. |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |ref=harv\n | title = Artificial Intelligence:  A Modern Approach\n | year = 2010\n | edition = 3rd\n | publisher = Prentice Hall\n | publication-place = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n | isbn = 978-0-13-604259-4\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Simon |first=Carl P. |first2=Lawrence |last2=Blume |ref=harv\n | title = Mathematics for Economists\n | edition = first\n | date = April 1994\n | isbn = 978-0-393-95733-4\n}} (Definition 9.31)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Monotone function|id=p/m064830}}\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ConvergenceOfAMonotonicSequence/ Convergence of a Monotonic Sequence] by Anik Debnath and Thomas Roxlo (The Harker School), [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* {{MathWorld |title=Monotonic Function |id=MonotonicFunction}}\n\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Types of functions]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word reworded", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function"}
