Jerry Sunborne ([[Benicio del Toro]]) is a [[heroin]] addict who has been Brian's close friend since childhood.\n\nAudrey gets tragic news delivered to her door by the local police: Brian has been killed in an attempt to defend a woman who was being beaten by her husband. On the day of the funeral Audrey realizes that she has forgotten to inform Jerry of Brian's death. Her brother Neal ([[Omar Benson Miller]]) delivers the message to Jerry and takes him to the funeral.\n\nAudrey invites Jerry to move into the room adjacent to their garage, which he does. During his stay at the Burke home Jerry struggles to remain drug-free and also becomes very fond of Harper and Dory. The relationship between Jerry and Audrey is fragile and complicated. Jerry helps Audrey cope in many ways, including lying with her in bed to help her sleep. But Audrey, upset and confused, takes out her grief at Brian's death on Jerry. She becomes angry when Jerry helps Dory overcome his fear of submerging his head in the pool, as this had been something Brian had tried to do for years.\n\nEventually her rudeness to Jerry causes him to move out and relapse with heroin. Audrey and Neal rescue and rehabilitate Jerry, and he agrees to admit himself to a specialized clinic. At first Harper, who has come to love Jerry, is angry that he is leaving, but after he leaves her a heartfelt note she accepts that he is going.\n\nAt the close of the film Jerry is still struggling with his addiction but seems to be well on his way to recovery. He leaves flowers on Audrey's doorstep with a note that reads, \"Accept the good\", a phrase which Jerry had told Brian, and that Brian had subsequently said to Audrey many times.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Audrey Burke\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Jerry Sunborne\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Brian Burke\n* Alexis Llewellyn as Harper Burke\n* Micah Berry as Dory Burke\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Howard Glassman\n* [[Alison Lohman]] as Kelly\n* [[Robin Weigert]] as Brenda\n* [[Omar Benson Miller]] as Neal\n* [[Liam James]] as cousin Dave\n\n==Music==\n\nThe soundtrack to ''Things We Lost in the Fire'' was released on October 30, 2007.\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| total_length    = 37:09<ref>[http://www.theost.com/2007/things_we_lost_in_the_fire.html Things We Lost in the Fire Soundtrack] TheOST.

The majority of the population lives on the {{convert|46|km2|0|abbr=out}} island of Lastovo.\n\nLastovo, like the rest of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]], was settled by [[Illyrians]]. The Romans conquered and settled the entire area, retaining control until the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] invasions and [[Migration Period|Slavic migrations]] in the 7th century. The Croats and other Slavic tribes subjugated by the Croats secured most of the Dalmatian seaboard, but [[Dalmatian City-States|some cities and islands]] (like Lagosta) of the [[romanisation (cultural)|romanised]] Dalmatians remained independent under the nominal rule of the Byzantines. In 1000 AD the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|attacked and destroyed the settlement]] due to the island's participation in piracy along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. After the Venetian domination, in the 13th century Lagosta joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]] where for several centuries it enjoyed a certain level of autonomy until the republic's conquest by the French, under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] then ruled the island for the next century, then Italy for 30 years after [[World War I]], and finally Yugoslavia until it became a part of the independent Republic of [[Croatia]].\n\nThe island is noted for its 15th- and 16th-century Venetian architecture. There is a large number of churches of relatively small size, a testament to the island's long-standing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition. The major cultural event is the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklade]], or carnival. The island largely relies on its natural environment to attract tourists each season. In 2006 the [[Croatian Government]] made the island and its archipelago a nature park.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.lastovo.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=64&lang=hr\n| title=Lastovsko oto\u010dje \u2013 11. hrvatski park prirode\n| work=www.lastovo.org\n| publisher=Park prirode Lastovo\n| language=Croatian\n| accessdate=2009-05-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lastovo and the surrounding islands.jpg|300px|left|thumbnail|Lastovo and surrounding islands]]\n[[File:2014-10-24 06-56-31 Croatia Dubrovacko-Neretvanska Oskoru\u0161no.jpg|left|thumbnail|Aerial view of Lastovo]]\nThe island of Lastovo belongs to the central Dalmatian archipelago.

Pre\u017eba is connected to the main island by a bridge at the village of Pasadur (\"golden passage\" in the local dialect, coming from Italian \"passo d'oro\").

His source was [[Theopompus]], a 4th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian. The names of numerous other Illyric settlements along the coast had the same suffix ''-est'' which indicates its [[Illyrian languages|Illyric]] origins. When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered Dalmatia they gave the island the Latin name '''Augusta Insula''' meaning \"Emperor's Island\". During the [[Middle Ages]], the name would be transcribed as ''Augusta'', ''Lagusta'' or ''Lagosta''. The Slavic suffix ''[[-ovo]]'' combined with the Roman form of ''Lasta'' gives the islands present name of ''Lastovo''.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nThe first traces of human presence on the island were found in the Ra\u010da cave where continuous evidence of habitation reaches as far as the late [[Neolithic Age]]. In prehistoric times the island was inhabited by the Illyrians. However finds of Greek ceramics show that the island was on one of the Greek trade routes on the Adriatic and probably a part of the state of [[Vis (island)|Issa]].<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the province of Dalmatia they too settled Lastovo. The Romans named the island '''Augusta Insula'''. The Romans left traces of their long rule on the island, in the form of the so-called ''[[villa rustica]]'' estates (residential farming units) and the water catchment areas known as the ''lokve''. The Romans established a settlement on location of today's village of [[Ubli, Lastovo|Ubli]] that flourished during first centuries AD, only to become completely abandoned in later centuries after being destroyed by the barbarians.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nWith the arrival of the [[Croats]] to Adriatic in the 7th century, Croats eventually settled most of Dalmatia which included Lastovo. Around 950, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos]] mentions Lastovo in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' by its [[Croatian language|Croatian]] name ''Lastobon''.<ref name=dai>{{cite book\n| last = [[Constantine VII]]\n| year = c. 950\n| title = [[De Administrando Imperio]]\n}}</ref> In 998 the [[Venetian Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]] launched large military operations against Croatian and Neretvian pirates along the Adriatic and its islands, which culminated in 1000 with the [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|destruction of the town of Lastovo]]. After that the residents (''Lastovci'' or ''Lastov\u010dani'') decided to build a city on the internal hill away from the coast which made the city more defendable. During the next two centuries, inhabitants dedicated themselves more to agriculture and neglected their earlier naval tradition.<ref name=jurica/> Scarcity of accurate historical documents and an almost complete silence covering the events on the island in the early Middle Ages are trustworthy signs of a great autonomy of Lastovo in that period. Lastovo may have at times come briefly under various rulers from the 7th to 13th centuries, whether [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Duklja]]n or [[Narentine]], however, it is accepted that Lastovo generally recognised the [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian kings]] as its nominal and natural rulers.<ref name=belamaric/><ref name=jurica/> In 1185 the [[Hvar diocese]] is formed of which Lastovo is mentioned as having been part. A church synod held in Split that same year decreed that the [[diocese of Hvar]] should fall under the authority of the [[Archbishop of Split]].\n\n===Republic of Ragusa===\n[[File:Pecat.gif|thumb|left|Lastovo commune's official seal known as the Pe\u010dat within the Republic of Ragusa]]\nLater in the 13th century the people of Lastovo voluntarily joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]]  in 1252 after the republic promised that it would honour Lastovo's internal autonomy. This agreement was codified in the Ragusa Statute written in 1272.<ref name=lucijanovic>{{cite book\n| last = Lucijanovi\u0107\n| first = Marin\n| year = 1954\n| title = Lastovo u sklopu Dubrova\u010dke republike\n| publisher =\n| location =\n| language = Croatian\n}}</ref> However, Ragusa purchased Lastovo from [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] king of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of [[Hum]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5hnDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA84&dq=serbia+dubrovnik&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj11vay3ebeAhUBlIsKHZY5A8cQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=serbia%20dubrovnik&f=false Dubrovnik:A History] by Robin Harris, chapter \"Territorial expansion\"</ref> In 1310 Lastovo got its first written legislation, the ''[[Statute of Lastovo]]'', which had all the characteristics of law.

Continuous limitation of the island's autonomy and higher taxes led to a short lived rebellion in 1602. On the appeal of islanders, [[Venice]] occupied the island the following year and held it until 1606, when it was returned to Ragusa. The next attempt at rebellion was in 1652, which resulted in the loss of the island's autonomy.<ref name=jurica/>\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquests, Lastovo was very often a target of [[pirate]]s from [[Ulcinj]], leading to the introduction of mandatory guard service. Guard service was abolished in the 18th century when pirates from Ulcinj became merchant sailors. The last reported outbreak of ''[[vampirism]]'' in Croatia was 'recorded' on Lastovo. The trial in Ragusa in 1737 took testimony from visitors to the island during an outbreak of ''severe diarrhoea'' which killed many locals. The islanders blamed this epidemic on vampires. This case included from Lastovo the defendants who formed a band or group of vigilante style vampire hunters. Such cases were reported throughout all of Croatia and indeed Europe in the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"liepopili\">Liepopili, Ante (1918). \"Vukodlaci\" (in Croatian).

When they abolished the Republic in 1808, Lastovo became part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and was included in the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\". The French built a fortification on Glavica hill and mobilised islanders against the British. Between 18 January and 3 February 1813, the [[Royal Navy]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] [[HMS Apollo (1805)|HMS ''Apollo'']] and troops captured Lastovo and [[Kor\u010dula]]. The British held the island until 1815 when the [[Congress of Vienna]] awarded the island to the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. After 1815, Lastovo was part of Dubrovnik county in the Austrian province of [[Dalmatia]]. Until 1829, it had its own court, but later the island fell under the jurisdiction of the court in [[Kor\u010dula]]. In the 1840s, the municipality fell into a deep economic crisis that resulted in its selling most of its forests to foreigners.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n[[File:Lagosta 1900 Lastovo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Austrian KK tax stamp cancelled in 1900, with both ''Croatian'' and ''Italian'' names]]\n\n===20th century===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2009}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] established a military garrison on Glavica consisting mostly of Hungarian troops. The authorities ordered blackouts and forbade the ringing of church bells during the war. At the end of 1917 four French planes  bombed Lastovo. Some French troops landed on the island to reconnoiter it. Italian forces soon followed and clashed with the garrison. Some members of the Austro-Hungarian garrison escaped. The Italians took those they caught to Italy as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. A French plane dropping leaflets on the island on 4 November brought the news that the war was finally over. On 11 November 1918 Italian troops took possession of the island based on the [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Secret Treaty of London]], which allocated much of Dalmatia to Italy upon Italy entering the war on the side of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The Italians based their claim upon the presence of ethnic Italians in all parts of maritime Dalmatia. However, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was a supporter of the nationality principle, blocked the allocation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Lastovo Ort.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Town of Lastovo]]\nAs a consequence, under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo agreement]] of 1920, Italy received in Dalmatia only Zara (today [[Zadar]]), due to its Italian majority, and Lagosta. Although the Italian population was in the minority, it was smaller than other Dalmatian places such as [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa){{Clarify|date=September 2012}}. After the advent of Fascism in Italy (1922), the Italians followed a policy of [[Italianization]] in all its possessions. At the same time, living standards improved. Many public works were started, and the island reached its peak population of approximately 2,000. This growth resulted in part from the immigration from other Dalmatian towns, of ethnic Italians who wished to live under Italian rule.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1941 the [[Axis Powers]] attacked Yugoslavia, which collapsed in few days.  Italy annexed part of Dalmatia; the remainder became part of the new [[Independent State of Croatia]]. On September 8, 1943, after the declaration of the [[Armistice with Italy]], the Italian Army collapsed and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] took over the island, incorporating it into [[Yugoslavia]]. Lastovo became a part of the [[History of Croatia|People's Republic of Croatia]] in 1945\u2014one of the six Republics of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and into the [[History of Croatia|Socialist Republic of Croatia]] \u2014 one of the republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1953.<ref name=jurica/> At this time all the Italian residents left the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Lastovo experienced the same fate as the neighbouring island [[Vis (island)|Vis]].  The island became a military region barred to foreign nationals.  The barring of foreign nationals led to economic stagnation and the depopulation of the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1988 the ban was lifted and foreign tourists were again allowed to visit the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, but the Yugoslav People's Army only left its bases on Lastovo, one of its last footholds in Croatia, in July 1992. The war in Croatia ended in 1995. Lastovo escaped much of the devastation that swept across some parts of Croatia and most of neighbouring Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n{| style=\"float:right;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population<ref>''Nautical Tourism Development in the Lastovo Islands Nature Park'', p. 6</ref>\n|-\n!

All the island residents participate by wearing folk costumes. The origins of the Lastovo carnival go back to a historical event. Legend has it that [[Catalan people|Catalan]] pirates attacked neighbouring [[Kor\u010dula]] and sent a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] messenger to Lastovo to tell the islanders to surrender or they would be next. The inhabitants of Lastovo did not let themselves be intimidated \u2014 instead they armed themselves and went on the attack. The women and children prayed to Sv. Jure ''([[St. George]])'' for help and their prayers were answered: a storm destroyed the pirates' ships and the inhabitants of Lastovo caught the messenger. In order to mock him, he was taken through the village on the back of a donkey and was afterwards sentenced and burned to death. This event is celebrated through the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklad]] every year over a period of three days. The event takes place in the middle of February and since the summer 2006 it has become main attraction for tourists.  Locals enjoy this event very much and Lastovci from all around Croatia return to Lastovo to attend the carnival.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.adriatica.net/croatia/feature/lastovo_en.htm\n| title = Lastovo \u2013 Carnival Island\n| accessdate = 6 March 2011\n| publisher = Adriatica.net\n}} Permission was granted by the website to publish the text under the terms of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].</ref>\n\n=== Churches ===\n[[File:Kuzma.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]]]]\nThe main church is the [[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]] ({{lang|hr|Crkva sv.

Out of the rest of the paintings ''Pieta'', the work of an anonymous Venetian painter from 1545, can be distinguished. On its place there was a smaller church that dates back from 5th or 6th century.  The church of Sv Vlaho (''[[Saint Blaise]]'') from the 12th century is on the entrance of the settlement.

Near the ferry port in Ubli an archaeological find of the remains of a 6th-century church dedicated to Sv Petar ''([[Saint Peter]])'' are situated. Other churches of interest are Sv Luka ''(St Luke)'' built in the typical Croatian 11th-century sacral architecture, and Sv Jurje ''(St George)'' at Pre\u017eba also built in the 11th century, was demolished between the two World Wars.

Most of them have high broad terraces which have become the ''\"trade mark\"'' look of Lastovo houses. Their unusual cylindrical chimneys that the locals call ''fumari'' are picturesque and unusual since they look like miniature minarets, although there is no record of Arab or Turkish influence ever directly reaching this area. The ornate chimney on the 16th century Biza Antica house is probably the oldest preserved chimney in Dalmatia. The Struga lighthouse built in 1839 on Lastovo's southern tip near [[Skrivena Luka]] is one of the oldest lighthouses in Croatia.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n===Language===\nInhabitants speak the [[Chakavian|\u010cakavian]] dialect of the Croatian language, maintaining a unique [[Shtokavian dialect|Jekavian]], known as [[Southeastern Chakavian]] variant possibly due to the influence from hundreds of years of association within the Dubrovnik Republic and also due to the island's remoteness.\n\nBefore the year 1000 AD the population of the island (then called \"Lagosta\") was mainly made by romanised Dalmatians of the [[Dalmatian City-States]]. But the first mentioned inhabitants of Lastovo were recorded two centuries later in the 13th century Republic of Ragusa's archives and in the ''[[Statute of Lastovo]]'', written in Italian and Latin: it clearly indicates that most of the population in that century had exclusively Croatian folk names.<ref name=jurica/> Only under Italian control in the 20th century, the island had again a majority of \"neolatin' speakers but they disappeared after [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor many centuries the only religion on the island has been [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], which has contributed to the preservation of the Latin names of certain settlements.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Prose|section|date=December 2012}}\n* [[Dobri\u0107 Dobri\u010devi\u0107]] ''(Bonino de Bonini)'', one of the pioneers of [[printing]] in Europe.

The majority of the population lives on the {{convert|46|km2|0|abbr=out}} island of Lastovo.\n\nLastovo, like the rest of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]], was settled by [[Illyrians]]. The Romans conquered and settled the entire area, retaining control until the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] invasions and [[Migration Period|Slavic migrations]] in the 7th century. The Croats and other Slavic tribes subjugated by the Croats secured most of the Dalmatian seaboard, but [[Dalmatian City-States|some cities and islands]] (like Lagosta) of the [[romanisation (cultural)|romanised]] Dalmatians remained independent under the nominal rule of the Byzantines. In 1000 AD the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|attacked and destroyed the settlement]] due to the island's participation in piracy along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. After the Venetian domination, in the 13th century Lagosta joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]] where for several centuries it enjoyed a certain level of autonomy until the republic's conquest by the French, under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] then ruled the island for the next century, then Italy for 30 years after [[World War I]], and finally Yugoslavia until it became a part of the independent Republic of [[Croatia]].\n\nThe island is noted for its 15th- and 16th-century Venetian architecture. There is a large number of churches of relatively small size, a testament to the island's long-standing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition. The major cultural event is the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklade]], or carnival. The island largely relies on its natural environment to attract tourists each season. In 2006 the [[Croatian Government]] made the island and its archipelago a nature park.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.lastovo.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=64&lang=hr\n| title=Lastovsko oto\u010dje \u2013 11. hrvatski park prirode\n| work=www.lastovo.org\n| publisher=Park prirode Lastovo\n| language=Croatian\n| accessdate=2009-05-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lastovo and the surrounding islands.jpg|300px|left|thumbnail|Lastovo and surrounding islands]]\n[[File:2014-10-24 06-56-31 Croatia Dubrovacko-Neretvanska Oskoru\u0161no.jpg|left|thumbnail|Aerial view of Lastovo]]\nThe island of Lastovo belongs to the central Dalmatian archipelago.

His source was [[Theopompus]], a 4th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian. The names of numerous other Illyric settlements along the coast had the same suffix ''-est'' which indicates its [[Illyrian languages|Illyric]] origins. When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered Dalmatia they gave the island the Latin name '''Augusta Insula''' meaning \"Emperor's Island\". During the [[Middle Ages]], the name would be transcribed as ''Augusta'', ''Lagusta'' or ''Lagosta''. The Slavic suffix ''[[-ovo]]'' combined with the Roman form of ''Lasta'' gives the islands present name of ''Lastovo''.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nThe first traces of human presence on the island were found in the Ra\u010da cave where continuous evidence of habitation reaches as far as the late [[Neolithic Age]]. In prehistoric times the island was inhabited by the Illyrians. However finds of Greek ceramics show that the island was on one of the Greek trade routes on the Adriatic and probably a part of the state of [[Vis (island)|Issa]].<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the province of Dalmatia they too settled Lastovo. The Romans named the island '''Augusta Insula'''. The Romans left traces of their long rule on the island, in the form of the so-called ''[[villa rustica]]'' estates (residential farming units) and the water catchment areas known as the ''lokve''. The Romans established a settlement on location of today's village of [[Ubli, Lastovo|Ubli]] that flourished during first centuries AD, only to become completely abandoned in later centuries after being destroyed by the barbarians.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nWith the arrival of the [[Croats]] to Adriatic in the 7th century, Croats eventually settled most of Dalmatia which included Lastovo. Around 950, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos]] mentions Lastovo in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' by its [[Croatian language|Croatian]] name ''Lastobon''.<ref name=dai>{{cite book\n| last = [[Constantine VII]]\n| year = c. 950\n| title = [[De Administrando Imperio]]\n}}</ref> In 998 the [[Venetian Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]] launched large military operations against Croatian and Neretvian pirates along the Adriatic and its islands, which culminated in 1000 with the [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|destruction of the town of Lastovo]]. After that the residents (''Lastovci'' or ''Lastov\u010dani'') decided to build a city on the internal hill away from the coast which made the city more defendable. During the next two centuries, inhabitants dedicated themselves more to agriculture and neglected their earlier naval tradition.<ref name=jurica/> Scarcity of accurate historical documents and an almost complete silence covering the events on the island in the early Middle Ages are trustworthy signs of a great autonomy of Lastovo in that period. Lastovo may have at times come briefly under various rulers from the 7th to 13th centuries, whether [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Duklja]]n or [[Narentine]], however, it is accepted that Lastovo generally recognised the [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian kings]] as its nominal and natural rulers.<ref name=belamaric/><ref name=jurica/> In 1185 the [[Hvar diocese]] is formed of which Lastovo is mentioned as having been part. A church synod held in Split that same year decreed that the [[diocese of Hvar]] should fall under the authority of the [[Archbishop of Split]].\n\n===Republic of Ragusa===\n[[File:Pecat.gif|thumb|left|Lastovo commune's official seal known as the Pe\u010dat within the Republic of Ragusa]]\nLater in the 13th century the people of Lastovo voluntarily joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]]  in 1252 after the republic promised that it would honour Lastovo's internal autonomy. This agreement was codified in the Ragusa Statute written in 1272.<ref name=lucijanovic>{{cite book\n| last = Lucijanovi\u0107\n| first = Marin\n| year = 1954\n| title = Lastovo u sklopu Dubrova\u010dke republike\n| publisher =\n| location =\n| language = Croatian\n}}</ref> However, Ragusa purchased Lastovo from [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] king of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of [[Hum]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5hnDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA84&dq=serbia+dubrovnik&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj11vay3ebeAhUBlIsKHZY5A8cQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=serbia%20dubrovnik&f=false Dubrovnik:A History] by Robin Harris, chapter \"Territorial expansion\"</ref> In 1310 Lastovo got its first written legislation, the ''[[Statute of Lastovo]]'', which had all the characteristics of law.

Continuous limitation of the island's autonomy and higher taxes led to a short lived rebellion in 1602. On the appeal of islanders, [[Venice]] occupied the island the following year and held it until 1606, when it was returned to Ragusa. The next attempt at rebellion was in 1652, which resulted in the loss of the island's autonomy.<ref name=jurica/>\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquests, Lastovo was very often a target of [[pirate]]s from [[Ulcinj]], leading to the introduction of mandatory guard service. Guard service was abolished in the 18th century when pirates from Ulcinj became merchant sailors. The last reported outbreak of ''[[vampirism]]'' in Croatia was 'recorded' on Lastovo. The trial in Ragusa in 1737 took testimony from visitors to the island during an outbreak of ''severe diarrhoea'' which killed many locals. The islanders blamed this epidemic on vampires. This case included from Lastovo the defendants who formed a band or group of vigilante style vampire hunters. Such cases were reported throughout all of Croatia and indeed Europe in the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"liepopili\">Liepopili, Ante (1918). \"Vukodlaci\" (in Croatian).

When they abolished the Republic in 1808, Lastovo became part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and was included in the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\". The French built a fortification on Glavica hill and mobilised islanders against the British. Between 18 January and 3 February 1813, the [[Royal Navy]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] [[HMS Apollo (1805)|HMS ''Apollo'']] and troops captured Lastovo and [[Kor\u010dula]]. The British held the island until 1815 when the [[Congress of Vienna]] awarded the island to the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. After 1815, Lastovo was part of Dubrovnik county in the Austrian province of [[Dalmatia]]. Until 1829, it had its own court, but later the island fell under the jurisdiction of the court in [[Kor\u010dula]]. In the 1840s, the municipality fell into a deep economic crisis that resulted in its selling most of its forests to foreigners.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n[[File:Lagosta 1900 Lastovo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Austrian KK tax stamp cancelled in 1900, with both ''Croatian'' and ''Italian'' names]]\n\n===20th century===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2009}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] established a military garrison on Glavica consisting mostly of Hungarian troops. The authorities ordered blackouts and forbade the ringing of church bells during the war. At the end of 1917 four French planes  bombed Lastovo. Some French troops landed on the island to reconnoiter it. Italian forces soon followed and clashed with the garrison. Some members of the Austro-Hungarian garrison escaped. The Italians took those they caught to Italy as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. A French plane dropping leaflets on the island on 4 November brought the news that the war was finally over. On 11 November 1918 Italian troops took possession of the island based on the [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Secret Treaty of London]], which allocated much of Dalmatia to Italy upon Italy entering the war on the side of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The Italians based their claim upon the presence of ethnic Italians in all parts of maritime Dalmatia. However, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was a supporter of the nationality principle, blocked the allocation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Lastovo Ort.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Town of Lastovo]]\nAs a consequence, under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo agreement]] of 1920, Italy received in Dalmatia only Zara (today [[Zadar]]), due to its Italian majority, and Lagosta. Although the Italian population was in the minority, it was smaller than other Dalmatian places such as [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa){{Clarify|date=September 2012}}. After the advent of Fascism in Italy (1922), the Italians followed a policy of [[Italianization]] in all its possessions. At the same time, living standards improved. Many public works were started, and the island reached its peak population of approximately 2,000. This growth resulted in part from the immigration from other Dalmatian towns, of ethnic Italians who wished to live under Italian rule.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1941 the [[Axis Powers]] attacked Yugoslavia, which collapsed in few days.  Italy annexed part of Dalmatia; the remainder became part of the new [[Independent State of Croatia]]. On September 8, 1943, after the declaration of the [[Armistice with Italy]], the Italian Army collapsed and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] took over the island, incorporating it into [[Yugoslavia]]. Lastovo became a part of the [[History of Croatia|People's Republic of Croatia]] in 1945\u2014one of the six Republics of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and into the [[History of Croatia|Socialist Republic of Croatia]] \u2014 one of the republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1953.<ref name=jurica/> At this time all the Italian residents left the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Lastovo experienced the same fate as the neighbouring island [[Vis (island)|Vis]].  The island became a military region barred to foreign nationals.  The barring of foreign nationals led to economic stagnation and the depopulation of the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1988 the ban was lifted and foreign tourists were again allowed to visit the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, but the Yugoslav People's Army only left its bases on Lastovo, one of its last footholds in Croatia, in July 1992. The war in Croatia ended in 1995. Lastovo escaped much of the devastation that swept across some parts of Croatia and most of neighbouring Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n{| style=\"float:right;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population<ref>''Nautical Tourism Development in the Lastovo Islands Nature Park'', p. 6</ref>\n|-\n!

All the island residents participate by wearing folk costumes. The origins of the Lastovo carnival go back to a historical event. Legend has it that [[Catalan people|Catalan]] pirates attacked neighbouring [[Kor\u010dula]] and sent a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] messenger to Lastovo to tell the islanders to surrender or they would be next. The inhabitants of Lastovo did not let themselves be intimidated \u2014 instead they armed themselves and went on the attack. The women and children prayed to Sv. Jure ''([[St. George]])'' for help and their prayers were answered: a storm destroyed the pirates' ships and the inhabitants of Lastovo caught the messenger. In order to mock him, he was taken through the village on the back of a donkey and was afterwards sentenced and burned to death. This event is celebrated through the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklad]] every year over a period of three days. The event takes place in the middle of February and since the summer 2006 it has become main attraction for tourists.  Locals enjoy this event very much and Lastovci from all around Croatia return to Lastovo to attend the carnival.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.adriatica.net/croatia/feature/lastovo_en.htm\n| title = Lastovo \u2013 Carnival Island\n| accessdate = 6 March 2011\n| publisher = Adriatica.net\n}} Permission was granted by the website to publish the text under the terms of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].</ref>\n\n=== Churches ===\n[[File:Kuzma.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]]]]\nThe main church is the [[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]] ({{lang|hr|Crkva sv. Kuzme i Damjana}}). It is situated in the oldest part of the square in the town of Lastovo and dates from the 14th century. On the main altar is the painting of Saint Cosmas and Damian.  Out of the rest of the paintings ''Pieta'', the work of an anonymous Venetian painter from 1545, can be distinguished. On its place there was a smaller church that dates back from 5th or 6th century.  The church of Sv Vlaho (''[[Saint Blaise]]'') from the 12th century is on the entrance of the settlement. Beside it the chapel of Saint John was built in 1607, and around the church a defence wall and a tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn the graveyard on the southern edge is the little church of [[Saint Mary]] in the field from the 14th century and is considered as most attractive on the island. Near the ferry port in Ubli an archaeological find of the remains of a 6th-century church dedicated to Sv Petar ''([[Saint Peter]])'' are situated. Other churches of interest are Sv Luka ''(St Luke)'' built in the typical Croatian 11th-century sacral architecture, and Sv Jurje ''(St George)'' at Pre\u017eba also built in the 11th century, was demolished between the two World Wars. Another church called St Peter in Ubli built somewhere in the 11th\u201313th centuries was demolished by the Italians in 1933 to make way for extra fishing sheds.<ref name=jurica/> All together there are a total of 46 churches, making the number [[46 (number)|46]] omnipresent since the island also has 46 hills, covers {{convert|46|km2|0|abbr=on}}, has 46 fields, and contains 46 islands in the archipelago.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:fumar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fumar]]\nThe town's buildings date mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries when the construction of about 20 [[Renaissance]] houses redefined the village's appearance. Most of them have high broad terraces which have become the ''\"trade mark\"'' look of Lastovo houses. Their unusual cylindrical chimneys that the locals call ''fumari'' are picturesque and unusual since they look like miniature minarets, although there is no record of Arab or Turkish influence ever directly reaching this area. The ornate chimney on the 16th century Biza Antica house is probably the oldest preserved chimney in Dalmatia. The Struga lighthouse built in 1839 on Lastovo's southern tip near [[Skrivena Luka]] is one of the oldest lighthouses in Croatia.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n===Language===\nInhabitants speak the [[Chakavian|\u010cakavian]] dialect of the Croatian language, maintaining a unique [[Shtokavian dialect|Jekavian]], known as [[Southeastern Chakavian]] variant possibly due to the influence from hundreds of years of association within the Dubrovnik Republic and also due to the island's remoteness.\n\nBefore the year 1000 AD the population of the island (then called \"Lagosta\") was mainly made by romanised Dalmatians of the [[Dalmatian City-States]]. But the first mentioned inhabitants of Lastovo were recorded two centuries later in the 13th century Republic of Ragusa's archives and in the ''[[Statute of Lastovo]]'', written in Italian and Latin: it clearly indicates that most of the population in that century had exclusively Croatian folk names.<ref name=jurica/> Only under Italian control in the 20th century, the island had again a majority of \"neolatin' speakers but they disappeared after [[World War II]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor many centuries the only religion on the island has been [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], which has contributed to the preservation of the Latin names of certain settlements.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Prose|section|date=December 2012}}\n* [[Dobri\u0107 Dobri\u010devi\u0107]] ''(Bonino de Bonini)'', one of the pioneers of [[printing]] in Europe.

Each day after breakfast, he goes to the supermarket, where he interacts in a friendly way with employees, often charming them with a magic trick.\n\nKate (Brooke Shields) is a teen-age girl who gets in a squabble with an intimidating man named Demesta (William Russ). The girl, who is wrapped in a towel and apparently otherwise nude, has locked herself in a bathroom to evade Demesta.  He pounds on the door and demands to know the details of a drug deal that Kate has fouled up. Kate escapes through the window, wearing only the towel, while a police officer knocks on the door of the apartment and grapples with Demesta. Demesta is chased down the street while Kate goes in a different direction.  She slips down a hillside staircase, losing the towel in the process.\n\nBill comes out of the grocery store, talking to the bag boy about magic tricks, and opens the trunk of his Pierce Arrow. They both see Kate, lying naked in the trunk. Stunned, Bill convinces the bag boy that it was just an illusion and drives away. Stopping on a secluded street, he confronts Kate, who asks him to take her to his house. He reluctantly agrees.\n\nBill asks Kate what's going on but she refuses to answer. He allows her to take shelter in his home and loans  her some of his clothes. Kate attempts to escape by dropping out of a window, spraining her ankle in the process. This attracts the attention of Bill's nosy neighbors, Stan (John Schuck) and Sue (Andrea Howard).\n\nNext, Bill goes to see his friend Max (Burl Ives), in a nursing home. Max, another ex-vaudevillian and a former roommate, is despondent and non-verbal. Bill visits him daily, cheerfully describing his daily activities. Today, he tells Max about Kate. Later, Bill is confronted by his daughter, Shirl (Lorraine Gary) and her husband, Harris (Nicolas Coster). Shirl feels that Bill is senile and tries to get power of attorney of  his bank account. Bill refuses and Shirl becomes furious.\n\nMeanwhile, Demesta is still in a rage. He intimidates Kate's friend, Roy (Christopher Knight), and vows to find Kate, implying that he will harm her. \n\nStan and Sue step up their meddling, calling Shirl about Kate. Shirl returns, demands to see Kate, and is put off by Bill again, who denies harboring a juvenile. \n\nKate finally confesses to Bill that she is on the run from a drug dealer. She claims that Demesta gave her money to make a connection but that she threw the cache into the sewer in a moment of panic. Bill advises her to go to the police but Kate is afraid to do so. \n\nThat night, Bill's poker buddies arrive and he introduces them to Kate. The evening is interrupted when Shirl returns with two police officers. Kate is concealed with a levitation magic trick and Shirl becomes more furious.\n\nThe next day, before Bill leaves to visit Max, Kate relates the story of a boy she once knew who also refused to talk and how the boy started talking once all the other kids ignored him. During the visit, Bill tells Max that he will never come to see him again unless Max talks. Max breaks down and begs Bill not to leave. Bill returns home to find Kate gone and becomes despondent.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate returns to her foster home, collects her belongings, and meets Roy at school. Kate reveals that she never made the connection and still has the $20,000 in cash. Shocked, Roy tells her that Demesta will kill her. She says she plans to leave town with the money. When Roy tells her that Demesta knows where she has been hiding, she becomes concerned about Bill.\n\nAfter she returns to Bill's house, Demesta forces his way in and a chase ensues.  Bill holds Demesta at bay with a sword and incapacitates him. The police are summoned and Demesta is arrested.

It was directed by [[Leonard B. Stern]] and was released in July 1979 by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=February 2015}}\nBill (George Burns) is an elderly ex-vaudevillian who lives alone, often looking at photographs of his deceased wife. Each day after breakfast, he goes to the supermarket, where he interacts in a friendly way with employees, often charming them with a magic trick.\n\nKate (Brooke Shields) is a teen-age girl who gets in a squabble with an intimidating man named Demesta (William Russ). The girl, who is wrapped in a towel and apparently otherwise nude, has locked herself in a bathroom to evade Demesta.  He pounds on the door and demands to know the details of a drug deal that Kate has fouled up. Kate escapes through the window, wearing only the towel, while a police officer knocks on the door of the apartment and grapples with Demesta. Demesta is chased down the street while Kate goes in a different direction.  She slips down a hillside staircase, losing the towel in the process.\n\nBill comes out of the grocery store, talking to the bag boy about magic tricks, and opens the trunk of his Pierce Arrow. They both see Kate, lying naked in the trunk. Stunned, Bill convinces the bag boy that it was just an illusion and drives away. Stopping on a secluded street, he confronts Kate, who asks him to take her to his house. He reluctantly agrees.\n\nBill asks Kate what's going on but she refuses to answer. He allows her to take shelter in his home and loans  her some of his clothes. Kate attempts to escape by dropping out of a window, spraining her ankle in the process. This attracts the attention of Bill's nosy neighbors, Stan (John Schuck) and Sue (Andrea Howard).\n\nNext, Bill goes to see his friend Max (Burl Ives), in a nursing home. Max, another ex-vaudevillian and a former roommate, is despondent and non-verbal. Bill visits him daily, cheerfully describing his daily activities. Today, he tells Max about Kate. Later, Bill is confronted by his daughter, Shirl (Lorraine Gary) and her husband, Harris (Nicolas Coster). Shirl feels that Bill is senile and tries to get power of attorney of  his bank account. Bill refuses and Shirl becomes furious.\n\nMeanwhile, Demesta is still in a rage. He intimidates Kate's friend, Roy (Christopher Knight), and vows to find Kate, implying that he will harm her. \n\nStan and Sue step up their meddling, calling Shirl about Kate. Shirl returns, demands to see Kate, and is put off by Bill again, who denies harboring a juvenile. \n\nKate finally confesses to Bill that she is on the run from a drug dealer. She claims that Demesta gave her money to make a connection but that she threw the cache into the sewer in a moment of panic. Bill advises her to go to the police but Kate is afraid to do so. \n\nThat night, Bill's poker buddies arrive and he introduces them to Kate. The evening is interrupted when Shirl returns with two police officers. Kate is concealed with a levitation magic trick and Shirl becomes more furious.\n\nThe next day, before Bill leaves to visit Max, Kate relates the story of a boy she once knew who also refused to talk and how the boy started talking once all the other kids ignored him. During the visit, Bill tells Max that he will never come to see him again unless Max talks. Max breaks down and begs Bill not to leave. Bill returns home to find Kate gone and becomes despondent.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate returns to her foster home, collects her belongings, and meets Roy at school. Kate reveals that she never made the connection and still has the $20,000 in cash. Shocked, Roy tells her that Demesta will kill her. She says she plans to leave town with the money. When Roy tells her that Demesta knows where she has been hiding, she becomes concerned about Bill.\n\nAfter she returns to Bill's house, Demesta forces his way in and a chase ensues.  Bill holds Demesta at bay with a sword and incapacitates him. The police are summoned and Demesta is arrested. Shirl arrives and Bill  asks her for a favor.\n\nMax packs his belongings, preparing to go back home with Bill, when he learns that Shirl and Harris have agreed to act as foster parents for Kate.  Bill explains that Kate will stay with him and Max on the week-ends. The film ends with the threesome departing together. \n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Burns]] as Bill Grant\n*[[Brooke Shields]] as Kate\n*[[Lorraine Gary]] as Shirley\n*[[Ray Bolger]] as Tom\n*[[Leon Ames]] as Manduke the Magnificent\n*[[Carl Ballantine]] as Reinholf the Remarkable\n*[[Keye Luke]] as Doctor Device\n*[[Burl Ives]] as Max Wellington\n*[[John Schuck]] as Stan Waterman\n*[[Nicolas Coster]] as Harris\n*[[Andrea Howard]] as Sue Waterman\n*[[William Russ]] as John Demesta\n*[[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]] as Roy\n*[[Julie Cobb]] as Dr. Nancy Faulkner\n*Peter Brandon as Woodrow\n*Jacque Lynn Colton as Edna\n*Robert Doran as Joseph (Box Boy)\n*[[Ben Frank]] as First Policeman\n*Arthur Rosenberg as Pharmacist\n*[[Roger Price (comedian)|Roger Price]] as Mailman\n*[[Tom Leopold]] as Policeman\n*[[Patrick Cronin (actor)|Patrick Cronin]] as Doctor\n*Kate Stern as Student\n*Levin Bailey as Student\n*[[Robert Phalen]] as Foster Father\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2014, the film was released on DVD by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Just-You-Kid-George-Burns/dp/B00KALQI1O|title= Amazon: Just You and Me, Kid|accessdate=2018-06-27 |website= Amazon.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80063/Just-You-And-Me-Kid/|title= Just You and Me, Kid (1979)|accessdate=2018-06-27 |website= tcm.com}}</ref> However, as of 2019, the film has not been released on [[Blu-Ray Disc|Blu-Ray]] or in the [[Digital distribution|digital format]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb title|id=0079384|title=Just You and Me, Kid}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|just_you_and_me_kid}}\n*{{tcmdb title|id=80063|title=Just You and Me, Kid}}\n*{{Amg movie|97501|Just You and Me, Kid}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Just You And Me, Kid}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Blu-ray Disc(viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_You_and_Me,_Kid"}

{"title_page": "Test Card F", "text_new": "{{short description|Test card used by BBC television for decades}}\n[[File:Testcard F.jpg|thumb|right|240px|BBC Test Card F as seen on BBC1 from 17 February 1991 to 4 October 1997.]]\n\n'''Test Card F''' is a [[test card]] that was created by the [[BBC]] and used on [[television]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and in countries elsewhere in the world for more than four decades. Like other test cards, it was usually shown while no [[Television program|programmes]] were being [[broadcast]]. It was the first to be transmitted in colour in the UK and the first to feature a person, and has become an iconic British image regularly subject to [[parody]].\n\nThe central image on the card shows [[Carole Hersee]] playing [[tic-tac-toe|noughts and crosses]] with a clown doll, Bubbles the Clown, surrounded by various [[grayscale|greyscales]] and colour test signals used to assess the quality of the transmitted picture. It was first broadcast on 2 July 1967 (the day after the first colour pictures appeared to the public on television) on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].\n\nThe card was developed by a BBC [[Broadcast engineering|engineer]], [[George Hersee]] (1924\u20132001), father of the girl in the central image. It was frequently broadcast during downtime on [[BBC Television]] until the early 1980s and was still seen before the start of programmes until [[BBC One|BBC1]] began to broadcast 24 hours a day in November 1997, and on [[BBC Two]] until its downtime was replaced entirely by ''[[Ceefax|Pages from Ceefax]]'' in 1998, after which it was only seen during engineering work, and was last seen in this role in 1999. The card was also seen on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the 1970s, occasionally used in conjunction with [[Philips PM5544|Test Card G]].\n\nIn the digital age, Test Card F and its variants are very infrequently broadcast, as downtime in schedules has largely become a thing of the past.  Several variations of TCF have been screened, among them '''Test Card J''' (digitally enhanced), '''Test Card W''' (widescreen) and its [[High-definition television|high definition]] variant, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as '''Test Card X'''.\n\nUp until the UK's [[digital switchover]], the testcard made an annual appearance during the annual RBS (rebroadcast standby)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix6uqyLvpds|title=BBC 1 RBS Tests 2008|first=|last=Mad Radio DXer|date=9 January 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Test Transmissions and, until 2013, during the [[BBC HD]] preview loop, which used Test Card W.\n\n==Technical information==\nVirtually all the designs and patterns on the card have some significance. Along the top (see above) are 95% [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]] [[SMPTE color bars|colour-bars]] in descending order of [[luminance]]\u2014[[white]], [[yellow]], [[cyan]], [[green]], [[magenta]], [[red]], [[blue]] and [[black]]. There are triangles on each of the four sides of the card to check for correct [[overscan]]ning of the picture. Standard greyscale and [[frequency response]] tests are found on the left and right respectively of the central picture. On the updated version known as Test Card J (including widescreen and HD versions), the X on the [[noughts-and-crosses]] board is an indicator for aligning the centre of the screen.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TCF.jpg|right|240px|thumb|The old Test Card F (with the second BBC logo as seen from 2 July 1967 until circa 1971).]] -->\n\nThe blocks of colour on the sides would cause the picture to tear horizontally if the [[Composite video|sync]] circuits were not adjusted properly. The closely spaced lines in various parts of the screen allowed focus to be checked from centre to edge; mistuning would also blur the lines. All parts of the [[grayscale|greyscale]] would not be distinct if contrast and brightness (both internal preset settings and user adjustments) were not set correctly. The black bar on a white background revealed [[ringing (signal)|ringing]] and signal reflections. The castellations along the top and bottom also revealed possible setup problems.\n\nA child was depicted so that wrong skin colour would be obvious and not subject to changing [[make-up]] fashions. The juxtaposed garish colours of the clown were such that a common [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] error called chrominance/luminance delay inequality would make the clown's yellow [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] turn white.\n\nModern circuitry using [[integrated circuit|large-scale integration]] is much less susceptible to most of these problems. Some of them are also associated with [[cathode ray tube]]s; [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), that are not scanned at high speed, also help. The test card was a vital tool in its day, but has become far less important.\n\nThe name of the broadcasting channel usually appeared in the space underneath the letter F\u2014a [[serif]] F denoting an original optical version of the test card.\n\nOriginally, Test Card F was a [[Reversal film|photographic slide]] made up of two transparencies in perfect registration\u2014one containing the colour information and the other the monochrome background. The card was converted to electronic form in 1984 when electronic storage became possible.\n\n==Audio accompaniment==\nA sound of some kind is usually transmitted in the background. It is sometimes music, usually a composition commissioned by the station itself or \"royalty-free\" [[stock music]]. Composers whose music has been used include [[Roger Roger (composer)|Roger Roger]], [[Johnny Pearson]], [[Neil Richardson (composer)|Neil Richardson]], [[Frank Chacksfield]], [[Syd Dale]], [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]], [[Brian Bennett]], [[Keith Mansfield]], and [[Alan Hawkshaw]].\n\nHowever, during more recent years in which the Test Card is only played during engineering tests on the BBC, it is more common to hear a steady tone of various pitches accompanied by a [[Speaking clock#United Kingdom|female talking clock]]. Test Card music had ceased to be frequently heard in the 1980s (though it continued to be played over [[Pages from Ceefax]] until the termination of that service on 23 October 2012).\n\n==Bubbles the Clown==\n[[File:TCF centre.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Original transparency of the central image created for Test Card F.]]\nAlong with his Test Card F co-star Carole Hersee, Bubbles has appeared for an estimated total of 70,000 hours<ref name=newsbbc>{{cite news|title=Test card special|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1282160.stm|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 April 2001}}</ref> on television, equivalent to nearly eight whole years, which is more than any living person other than Carole (who still owns Bubbles).<ref>{{cite news|last=Deacon|first=Michael|title=Talking about the Test Card|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3665389/Talking-about-the-Test-Card.html|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Colour===\nBubbles's original body colour was [[blue]] and [[white]], but the BBC engineers decided that [[green]] was also needed within the scene<ref name=murphy>{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Dave|title=Test Card \u2018F\u2019|url=http://www.murphy-radio.co.uk/gallery/tcf/bbc_tcf.html|work=The Test Card Gallery|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref> as the other two television [[Primary colour#Additive primaries|primary colours]], [[red]] and blue, were already shown.

This is to aid in the detection of frozen digital links.\n* The central image is based on the same source photograph, but with some minor adjustments:\n** It has been rescanned from the original transparency for improved colour accuracy.\n** The image has been re-aligned within Test Card J such that the cross on the [[tic-tac-toe|noughts and crosses]] board is at the exact centre of the screen, as some believe was originally intended.\n** It is less tightly cropped, resulting in more edge detail from the original photograph being visible.<ref name='meldrum' />\n\n===Test Card W {{anchor|testcardw}}===\n\n'''Test Card W''' is an updated 16:9 (1.78:1) [[widescreen]] version of Test Card F.

However, since the closure of Ceefax, the shutdown of analogue television transmissions, and the imposition budgetary constraints, a new revision of the testcard can be seen daily on BBC Two and BBC Two HD at the end of the \"This is BBC Two\" transmission. Each morning, as the segment concludes, the testcard is broadcast for approximately one minute.\n\nFor the fortieth anniversary of Test Card F, there was some renewed interest in Bubbles in the media; in a 2007 interview, Hersee mentioned that she took Bubbles into school with her to prove to her [[Head teacher|headmaster]] that she really was the girl in the picture.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090627131751/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/personal-column-testcard-special-450533.html Personal Column: Test-card special] ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>\n\nThe BBC website (as of July 2017) continues to feature Bubbles next to a blackboard with \"[[HTTP 404|404]]\" inscribed on it when a user visits a page that does not exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=404 page|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/404.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>  Similarly, the BBC website's \"[[HTTP 500|500]]\" Internal Error page features Bubbles crossed-eyed next to a blackboard but with fire in the background.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/bbc-webiste-down-creepy-clown-5333053 |title=BBC website down: Incredibly creepy clown in error message is freaking people out  |publisher=Mirror |accessdate=9 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{sources|section|date=May 2017}}\n\n{{in popular culture|date=February 2020}}\nVariations and parodies of Test Card F are common in British broadcasting, Internet sites and games.\n\n===Television===\n*In the 1970s [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[satire|satirical series]], ''[[End of Part One]]'', there is an audition for a new test card 'girl'. This features various adults (including a bearded man) sitting behind a giant test-card cutout and attempting the same pose as Test Card F.\n* The BBC's 1989 documentary for the ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series, \"[[Slim Gaillard]]'s Civilization\", begins by showing Slim Gaillard watching the original Test Card F.  Carole ages and he starts talking to her. She answers him and she begins interviewing him. Carole is at the end and start of all four episodes. The documentary concludes with Slim Gaillard entering the screen and playing noughts and crosses with her. When they finish playing there is an explosion in front of the set. \n*A fictional version of Test Card F, of sorts, appears in the BBC television series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]''. A girl resembling [[Test Card Girl|Carole Hersee]] as she appeared in the test card acts as a sort of spiritual guide in the series. The real thing flashes on and off during a special BBC One ident for the series as part of the transition from a modern BBC One ident to the 1970s style \"Mirror Globe\".\n*A [[BBC Two|BBC2]] [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]] shown from 1992 to 1993 showed a girl acting as [[Carole Hersee]] replacing Bubbles The Clown with a logo \"2\" made of strings next to the blackboard.\n*A version of Test Card F (with Carole replaced) was seen in 2006 on [[Channel M]] as part of the [[Frank Sidebottom]] show.\n*[[ITV Digital]], the former [[United Kingdom|UK]] pay-TV platform, featured ''Al'' ([[Johnny Vegas]]) ''and Monkey'' as the girl and clown on its spoof testcard, shown when some of the channels on the platform were off air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1883306.stm|title=BBC News - TV AND RADIO - Johnny Vegas: Veteran newcomer|publisher=}}</ref>\n*An updated version of Test Card F has appeared on [[Sky+ HD|Sky HD]], with television presenter [[Myleene Klass]] playing the role of Carole Hersee. Unlike the original static Test Card F, Klass steps out of the frame and gives viewers a ten-minute guide to high-definition television.\n*Nick UK showed a parody of Test Card F during off-time circa 1997, using Test Card N. It features a big Nick ''splat'' logo in the center, and pictures of ''stars'' (like [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]] from ''[[Rugrats]]'', or Stimpy from ''[[Ren & Stimpy]]'') on other areas.\n*The celebrity quiz show ''[[It's Only TV...but I Like It]]'' used a version of the test card replacing the scene with the host [[Jonathan Ross]] and regular team captains [[Julian Clary]] and [[Phill Jupitus]] surrounding the chalkboard as a promotional image.\n*It was spoofed in an episode of ''[[Spitting Image]]'' which featured Bubbles complaining about the music being played, then going on strike, with [[Nicholas Witchell]] brought in as a replacement, much to Carole's dismay.\n*The sketch comedy programme ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'' featured a recurring sketch known as \"The Quiz Broadcast\"\u2014a [[quiz show]] being broadcast by the British Emergency Broadcasting System in a post-apocalyptic setting. The sketch opened with continuity being announced over a parody of Test Card F, featuring Bubbles with a sad face, Carole wearing a [[gas mask]], and depressing phrases such as \"Mummy won't wake up\" written on the blackboard.\n*The comedy programme ''[[Look Around You]]'' used it in \"Live Final\", the series finale, when one of the contestants got aggressive, and BBC2 temporarily pulled the live broadcast while the contestant was removed from the building.\n*During the last appearance of Otis the Aardvark on [[CBBC]], Otis appeared in Test Card F frame, finishing the Noughts and Crosses puzzle on the blackboard.\n*In one episode of the [[CBBC]] Saturday Morning show ''[[Live & Kicking]]'', [[Jamie Theakston]] told the viewers that messing with the controls of the BBC studio could cause them to go off air. Upon hearing this, [[Mr Blobby]] smacked down on them, and caused the image to come up, although with it being labeled [[Test Card B|B]] (as in Blobby) and with Mr. Blobby replacing Carole.\n* A parody of Test Card F, drawn in flash animation, features as one of [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s 'Estings' bumpers.\n\n===Other===\n*The image has appeared on recordings of [[easy listening]] music played during transmissions: ''The Girl, The Doll, The Music'' and ''Big Bandwidth'', both released by [[Chandos Records]].\n*Another parody appears in ''[[Postman Pat: The Movie]]''.\n*In ''[[Fable II]]'', a parody of the card is found in the video option screen.\n*[[Roger Mellie]] of ''[[Viz comic|Viz]]'' magazine fame appeared in the introductory frame of one of his cartoons as a substitute for Carole Hersee.

Like other test cards, it was usually shown while no [[Television program|programmes]] were being [[broadcast]]. It was the first to be transmitted in colour in the UK and the first to feature a person, and has become an iconic British image regularly subject to [[parody]].\n\nThe central image on the card shows [[Carole Hersee]] playing [[tic-tac-toe|noughts and crosses]] with a clown doll, Bubbles the Clown, surrounded by various [[grayscale|greyscales]] and colour test signals used to assess the quality of the transmitted picture. It was first broadcast on 2 July 1967 (the day after the first colour pictures appeared to the public on television) on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].\n\nThe card was developed by a BBC [[Broadcast engineering|engineer]], [[George Hersee]] (1924\u20132001), father of the girl in the central image. It was frequently broadcast during downtime on [[BBC Television]] until the early 1980s and was still seen before the start of programmes until [[BBC One|BBC1]] began to broadcast 24 hours a day in November 1997, and on [[BBC Two]] until its downtime was replaced entirely by ''[[Ceefax|Pages from Ceefax]]'' in 1998, after which it was only seen during engineering work, and was last seen in this role in 1999. The card was also seen on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the 1970s, occasionally used in conjunction with [[Philips PM5544|Test Card G]].\n\nIn the digital age, Test Card F and its variants are very infrequently broadcast, as downtime in schedules has largely become a thing of the past.  Several variations of TCF have been screened, among them '''Test Card J''' (digitally enhanced), '''Test Card W''' (widescreen) and its [[High-definition television|high definition]] variant, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as '''Test Card X'''.\n\nUp until the UK's [[digital switchover]], the testcard made an annual appearance during the annual RBS (rebroadcast standby)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix6uqyLvpds|title=BBC 1 RBS Tests 2008|first=|last=Mad Radio DXer|date=9 January 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Test Transmissions and, until 2013, during the [[BBC HD]] preview loop, which used Test Card W.\n\n==Technical information==\nVirtually all the designs and patterns on the card have some significance. Along the top (see above) are 95% [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]] [[SMPTE color bars|colour-bars]] in descending order of [[luminance]]\u2014[[white]], [[yellow]], [[cyan]], [[green]], [[magenta]], [[red]], [[blue]] and [[black]]. There are triangles on each of the four sides of the card to check for correct [[overscan]]ning of the picture. Standard greyscale and [[frequency response]] tests are found on the left and right respectively of the central picture. On the updated version known as Test Card J (including widescreen and HD versions), the X on the [[noughts-and-crosses]] board is an indicator for aligning the centre of the screen.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TCF.jpg|right|240px|thumb|The old Test Card F (with the second BBC logo as seen from 2 July 1967 until circa 1971).]] -->\n\nThe blocks of colour on the sides would cause the picture to tear horizontally if the [[Composite video|sync]] circuits were not adjusted properly. The closely spaced lines in various parts of the screen allowed focus to be checked from centre to edge; mistuning would also blur the lines. All parts of the [[grayscale|greyscale]] would not be distinct if contrast and brightness (both internal preset settings and user adjustments) were not set correctly. The black bar on a white background revealed [[ringing (signal)|ringing]] and signal reflections. The castellations along the top and bottom also revealed possible setup problems.\n\nA child was depicted so that wrong skin colour would be obvious and not subject to changing [[make-up]] fashions. The juxtaposed garish colours of the clown were such that a common [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] error called chrominance/luminance delay inequality would make the clown's yellow [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] turn white.\n\nModern circuitry using [[integrated circuit|large-scale integration]] is much less susceptible to most of these problems. Some of them are also associated with [[cathode ray tube]]s; [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), that are not scanned at high speed, also help. The test card was a vital tool in its day, but has become far less important.\n\nThe name of the broadcasting channel usually appeared in the space underneath the letter F\u2014a [[serif]] F denoting an original optical version of the test card.\n\nOriginally, Test Card F was a [[Reversal film|photographic slide]] made up of two transparencies in perfect registration\u2014one containing the colour information and the other the monochrome background. The card was converted to electronic form in 1984 when electronic storage became possible.\n\n==Audio accompaniment==\nA sound of some kind is usually transmitted in the background. It is sometimes music, usually a composition commissioned by the station itself or \"royalty-free\" [[stock music]]. Composers whose music has been used include [[Roger Roger (composer)|Roger Roger]], [[Johnny Pearson]], [[Neil Richardson (composer)|Neil Richardson]], [[Frank Chacksfield]], [[Syd Dale]], [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]], [[Brian Bennett]], [[Keith Mansfield]], and [[Alan Hawkshaw]].\n\nHowever, during more recent years in which the Test Card is only played during engineering tests on the BBC, it is more common to hear a steady tone of various pitches accompanied by a [[Speaking clock#United Kingdom|female talking clock]]. Test Card music had ceased to be frequently heard in the 1980s (though it continued to be played over [[Pages from Ceefax]] until the termination of that service on 23 October 2012).\n\n==Bubbles the Clown==\n[[File:TCF centre.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Original transparency of the central image created for Test Card F.]]\nAlong with his Test Card F co-star Carole Hersee, Bubbles has appeared for an estimated total of 70,000 hours<ref name=newsbbc>{{cite news|title=Test card special|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1282160.stm|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 April 2001}}</ref> on television, equivalent to nearly eight whole years, which is more than any living person other than Carole (who still owns Bubbles).<ref>{{cite news|last=Deacon|first=Michael|title=Talking about the Test Card|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3665389/Talking-about-the-Test-Card.html|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Colour===\nBubbles's original body colour was [[blue]] and [[white]], but the BBC engineers decided that [[green]] was also needed within the scene<ref name=murphy>{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Dave|title=Test Card \u2018F\u2019|url=http://www.murphy-radio.co.uk/gallery/tcf/bbc_tcf.html|work=The Test Card Gallery|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref> as the other two television [[Primary colour#Additive primaries|primary colours]], [[red]] and blue, were already shown.

This is to aid in the detection of frozen digital links.\n* The central image is based on the same source photograph, but with some minor adjustments:\n** It has been rescanned from the original transparency for improved colour accuracy.\n** The image has been re-aligned within Test Card J such that the cross on the [[tic-tac-toe|noughts and crosses]] board is at the exact centre of the screen, as some believe was originally intended.\n** It is less tightly cropped, resulting in more edge detail from the original photograph being visible.<ref name='meldrum' />\n\n===Test Card W {{anchor|testcardw}}===\n\n'''Test Card W''' is an updated 16:9 (1.78:1) [[widescreen]] version of Test Card F.

Extra mirrored arrow-heads on the central axis at the sides mark the positions of the middle 4:3 and 14:9 sections of the image.\n\nOn [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in the United Kingdom, Test Card W can be viewed at any time on most Freeview boxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=728925|title=Hidden testcard on topup box |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}</ref>\n\n==== BBC HD channel variant (\"Test Card X\") {{anchor|testcardx}} ====\n\nA [[1080p|1080 line]] variant of Test Card W (sometimes referred to unofficially<ref name=\"Quested_quote\">{{cite web|author=Quested, Andy |work=BBC Internet blog|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/12/a_christmas_present_from_the_h.html|accessdate=2013-12-21|title=A Christmas Present from the HD Channel!|quote=The test card seems to have been given the name \"Test Card X\" but not by us, it is in fact a modified high definition version of test card W}}</ref> as '''Test Card X''') was used on the now-defunct [[BBC HD|BBC HD channel]].

However, since the closure of Ceefax, the shutdown of analogue television transmissions, and the imposition budgetary constraints, a new revision of the testcard can be seen daily on BBC Two and BBC Two HD at the end of the \"This is BBC Two\" transmission. Each morning, as the segment concludes, the testcard is broadcast for approximately one minute.\n\nFor the fortieth anniversary of Test Card F, there was some renewed interest in Bubbles in the media; in a 2007 interview, Hersee mentioned that she took Bubbles into school with her to prove to her [[Head teacher|headmaster]] that she really was the girl in the picture.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090627131751/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/personal-column-testcard-special-450533.html Personal Column: Test-card special] ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>\n\nThe BBC website (as of July 2017) continues to feature Bubbles next to a blackboard with \"[[HTTP 404|404]]\" inscribed on it when a user visits a page that does not exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=404 page|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/404.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>  Similarly, the BBC website's \"[[HTTP 500|500]]\" Internal Error page features Bubbles crossed-eyed next to a blackboard but with fire in the background.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/bbc-webiste-down-creepy-clown-5333053 |title=BBC website down: Incredibly creepy clown in error message is freaking people out  |publisher=Mirror |accessdate=9 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{sources|section|date=May 2017}}\n\n{{in popular culture|date=February 2020}}\nVariations and parodies of Test Card F are common in British broadcasting, Internet sites and games.\n\n===Television===\n*In the 1970s [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[satire|satirical series]], ''[[End of Part One]]'', there is an audition for a new test card 'girl'.

When they finish playing there is an explosion in front of the set. \n*A fictional version of Test Card F, of sorts, appears in the BBC television series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]''. A girl resembling [[Test Card Girl|Carole Hersee]] as she appeared in the test card acts as a sort of spiritual guide in the series. The real thing flashes on and off during a special BBC One ident for the series as part of the transition from a modern BBC One ident to the 1970s style \"Mirror Globe\".\n*A [[BBC Two|BBC2]] [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]] shown from 1992 to 1993 showed a girl acting as [[Carole Hersee]] replacing Bubbles The Clown with a logo \"2\" made of strings next to the blackboard.\n*A version of Test Card F (with Carole replaced) was seen in 2006 on [[Channel M]] as part of the [[Frank Sidebottom]] show.\n*[[ITV Digital]], the former [[United Kingdom|UK]] pay-TV platform, featured ''Al'' ([[Johnny Vegas]]) ''and Monkey'' as the girl and clown on its spoof testcard, shown when some of the channels on the platform were off air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1883306.stm|title=BBC News - TV AND RADIO - Johnny Vegas: Veteran newcomer|publisher=}}</ref>\n*An updated version of Test Card F has appeared on [[Sky+ HD|Sky HD]], with television presenter [[Myleene Klass]] playing the role of Carole Hersee. Unlike the original static Test Card F, Klass steps out of the frame and gives viewers a ten-minute guide to high-definition television.\n*Nick UK showed a parody of Test Card F during off-time circa 1997, using Test Card N. It features a big Nick ''splat'' logo in the center, and pictures of ''stars'' (like [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]] from ''[[Rugrats]]'', or Stimpy from ''[[Ren & Stimpy]]'') on other areas.\n*The celebrity quiz show ''[[It's Only TV...but I Like It]]'' used a version of the test card replacing the scene with the host [[Jonathan Ross]] and regular team captains [[Julian Clary]] and [[Phill Jupitus]] surrounding the chalkboard as a promotional image.\n*It was spoofed in an episode of ''[[Spitting Image]]'' which featured Bubbles complaining about the music being played, then going on strike, with [[Nicholas Witchell]] brought in as a replacement, much to Carole's dismay.\n*The sketch comedy programme ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'' featured a recurring sketch known as \"The Quiz Broadcast\"\u2014a [[quiz show]] being broadcast by the British Emergency Broadcasting System in a post-apocalyptic setting. The sketch opened with continuity being announced over a parody of Test Card F, featuring Bubbles with a sad face, Carole wearing a [[gas mask]], and depressing phrases such as \"Mummy won't wake up\" written on the blackboard.\n*The comedy programme ''[[Look Around You]]'' used it in \"Live Final\", the series finale, when one of the contestants got aggressive, and BBC2 temporarily pulled the live broadcast while the contestant was removed from the building.\n*During the last appearance of Otis the Aardvark on [[CBBC]], Otis appeared in Test Card F frame, finishing the Noughts and Crosses puzzle on the blackboard.\n*In one episode of the [[CBBC]] Saturday Morning show ''[[Live & Kicking]]'', [[Jamie Theakston]] told the viewers that messing with the controls of the BBC studio could cause them to go off air. Upon hearing this, [[Mr Blobby]] smacked down on them, and caused the image to come up, although with it being labeled [[Test Card B|B]] (as in Blobby) and with Mr. Blobby replacing Carole.\n* A parody of Test Card F, drawn in flash animation, features as one of [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s 'Estings' bumpers.\n\n===Other===\n*The image has appeared on recordings of [[easy listening]] music played during transmissions: ''The Girl, The Doll, The Music'' and ''Big Bandwidth'', both released by [[Chandos Records]].\n*Another parody appears in ''[[Postman Pat: The Movie]]''.\n*In ''[[Fable II]]'', a parody of the card is found in the video option screen.\n*[[Roger Mellie]] of ''[[Viz comic|Viz]]'' magazine fame appeared in the introductory frame of one of his cartoons as a substitute for Carole Hersee.  Instead of playing [[noughts and crosses]], he has written \"Bollocks\" on the blackboard.\n*Sun television columnist Ally Ross uses a parody of Test Card F, replacing Carole Hersee with himself, the blackboard text always referencing an event from that week's popular TV programmes.\n*On the ''[[Cracking Contraptions]]'' episode \"The Tellyscope\", the test card appears, but it is nicknamed Test Card \"W&G\", and Bubbles and Carole are replaced by Shaun and Wallace.\n*Bubbles is often seen as an [[evil clown]], inciting [[Coulrophobia|phobia]] in some young children who witnessed him,<ref name=newsbbc/> and is described as \"somewhat unsettling\".<ref name=newsbbc/>\n*A promotional \"blip\" for [[Radiohead]]'s 2000 album ''[[Kid A]]'' features an antique television set displaying a version of the test card with the band's Modified Bear logo in place of the original photograph and the text \"TESTSPECIMENS\" in place of the BBC One logo, set to an excerpt from the ''Kid A'' track \"Treefingers\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Radiohead |title=Blips |url=https://www.radiohead.com/library/#kida/blips |website=Radiohead Public Library |publisher=XL Recordings |accessdate=5 April 2020 |ref=Radiohead |date=2020}}</ref>\n*The test card is parodied in the music video for \"[[(Waiting For) The Ghost Train]]\" by [[Madness (band)|Madness]], replacing Hersee with a band member, [[Chas Smash]], in drag and replacing the \"BBC TV\" logo with the text \"MAD 1 COLOUR\" (with a similar look to the BBC logo).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6pF1CwjKpA Madness \u2013 Ghost Train music video on YouTube] \u2013 first seen at 10 seconds into the video introduction</ref>\n*A parody of Test Card F appears numerous times in the music video of ''[[Moving to New York]]'' by the band [[The Wombats]]. Carole Hersee is replaced by images of the band in various poses.\n*At the end of the ''[[Shrek 4-D]]'' pre-show, the monitor screen shows Lord Farquaad replacing the image of [[Carole Hersee]] with himself.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n*The beginning and end of the [[Gorillaz]] music video \"[[Hallelujah Money]]\" parodies the test card by having [[Murdoc Niccals|Murdoc]] replace Carole Hersee and [[2D (character)|2D]] replace Bubbles. The text underneath references their song, \"[[19-2000]]\".<ref>{{Citation|publisher=[[UPROXX]]|title=Hallelujah Money (feat.

The old part of the town is of [[Mediterranean]] architecture and is separated from the green peninsula on which the settlement is situated by a large natural inlet and port. The sandy beaches of Sabusa, Kostanj, Zelena Punta, and Jelenica stretch to both sides of the island in the shade of centennial pinewood. Orange roofs top the houses that display Roman ruins with grape and kiwi vines curling around the corners. Every year a traditional procession to the shrine of Our Lady of Snow is held on 5 August, in memory of the day when, according to legend, it snowed five centuries earlier. Some annual activities/ festivities are the boats encircling the boat that carries the \"Lady of Snow\" statue, tug-of-war, donkey races, and climbing a greased pole to get to a prosciutto that is hung at the top. Kukljica is home to the Me\u0161tri\u0107, Martinovi\u0107, Blagdan, Beni\u0107, Vulin & Mili\u0107 families.\nKukljica is situated at the southeast end of the island of Ugljan. It has 52 km2 and 75&nbsp;km of coastline abounding with bays. Ugljan faces Zadar from which it is separated by the Zadar Channel which is only 3 NM wide. It is well-connected with the mainland by ferryboats. A bridge at the crossing \u017ddrelac connects Ugljan with the island of Pa\u0161man.\nThe picturesque fishing village lies on a large natural bay not far from the sea crossing \u017ddrelac so that it can be called \u00abthe door to the National Park Kornati\u00bb. In the old village nucleus genuine examples of island building can still be seen and it is a special pleasure to walk down the quay and throw a glance at the small port always filled with boats and sailboats. In the haven Kostanj there is a valuable historical monument, the restored old Christian church of St. Jerome from the 13th century.\nThe genuine attraction of Kukljica is the traditional procession by boat on the 5th of August, which has been taking place here since 1514, when the statue of Our Lady is taken from the votive church of Our Lady of the Snow in the sea crossing \u017ddrelac to the parish church of St. Paul dating from the 17th century. The statue is accompanied by a procession of hundreds of boats of all sizes.
