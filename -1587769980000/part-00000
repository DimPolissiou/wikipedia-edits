This problem continues during his class trip to Gollyworld, where he misses out on many of the rides because Craig tells the popular kids that Jimmy will hold their items for them. The popular kids then, on Craig's suggestion, tell Jimmy to go try to find Milt Appleday's ([[Fred Willard]]) frozen brain, which supposedly is hidden somewhere in Tux's Arctic Adventure. As usual, Jimmy unwillingly gives in, and once there, bumps into Milt's middle-age clumsy son Sonny ([[Matt Knudsen]]), who is attempting to retrieve the brain from underneath the ice. After being spotted by Sonny, Jimmy quickly flees and during his escape, accidentally runs onto the path of an oncoming train and is sent to an on-premises hospital staffed by park staff who are also secretly certified physicians, where Milt's brain (which one of the doctors keeps in his lunch cooler) is transplanted into his head. He makes it out of the operation just fine with his personality intact (explained by the doctors salvaging his \"personality gland\") but, he can now see all of Appleday's characters in real life, while no one else can.\n\nWith the help of his crush, Robin ([[Eunice Cho]]), who is also Craig's sister, Jimmy and the characters learn that the reason they've lost their popularity is thanks to Sonny, who unwittingly ruined their cartoons through his own ideas, especially Golly, who is crushed to learn that his top spot as most popular cartoon character in the world has been reduced to nothing, but he figures with Jimmy now at the helm, he can quickly make him a star again, now that he's president of Appleday Pictures (Sonny was fired by the Chairman of the Board). Jimmy is immensely popular, but no longer has time for school or his friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonny has rented out a room in Jimmy's house and now lives with his family because Jimmy's dad allows him when Sonny is deceiving the family. Sonny has dinner with them and meets Jimmy's alien sister, Yancy (Rhea Lando), all the while constantly scheming to get Milt's brain out of Jimmy's head and for himself. And without the brain, Jimmy would die. He devises a plan to modify Crocco's train to include several dangerous devices on it that will decapitate Jimmy and get him what he wants. However, he says this plan out loud (yelling it at the top of his lungs) and Yancy catches on.\n\nEventually, Robin attempts to point out to Jimmy that the cartoons are walking all over him just like everybody else used to, but he denies this, adding that the only reason Robin even liked him was because of him having Milt's brain. He takes off for his television debut, leaving her behind to encounter Sonny, who says that since she knows his plan, he'll have to do away with her. At the studio, Jimmy tells the ego-maniac Golly that all that the Presidency of Appleday Studios has gotten him isn't what he really wanted, which drives Golly to get angry at him and shout at him that it is impossible for him to say no to anybody. Jimmy finally realizes Robin was right and denounces his position as President on-air. Sonny, however, still wants the brain, and has tied Robin down to the train tracks, forcing Jimmy and the characters (even Golly, who apologizes along the way) to go save her. Golly temporarily changes Jimmy into a cartoon \"Knight in shining armor\".\n\nRobin is saved from being run over after Jimmy goes inside the train and destroys the engine. Sonny's plan is foiled. Jimmy dresses up as Milt to hide from Sonny, and Sonny is momentarily distracted by his affection for his father. Yancy saves Jimmy just in time by using her power of teleportation. Robin and Jimmy return to Craig's house, where he was planning to throw a party with Jimmy as the guest of honor, and everything is patched up between them. However, since the partygoers were watching the show he was on, and saw him talk about the importance of friendship, they figured Jimmy wasn't cool, and instead just stupid at giving up all that fame, and leave the party.\n\nIn an epilogue, Jimmy is leaving for school. Sonny still wants the brain and is seen hiding behind a curtain. He has a device that can grab his head. Sonny almost succeeds, but the crane misses its target. He laughs evilly in the end, with Yancy telling him to shut up.\n\n===\"Golly Gopher: Hero in Train-ing\"===\nIt is an exclusive animated short produced by [[Renegade Animation]] which is included as a bonus on ''Re-Animated'' DVD; an extract was shown in the movie itself but only after the intro.

Carruthers' career in justice advocacy spans over ten years, working with some high-profile activist organizations including [[Color of Change]] and [[Women's Media Center]]. She was an integral member in the creation of the Black Youth Project 100, and has served as National Director or National Coordinator since the organization's founding in 2013. Carruthers is the author of ''Unapologetic: A Black, Queer, and Feminist Mandate for Radical Movements'' published by Penguin Random House in 2018. \n\n==Developing leadership==\n\nMuch of Carruthers' work in social activism centers on developing broad based political participation and leadership for marginalized communities. Several political organizations including [[Wellstone Action]] and the [[NAACP]] have called upon her energy and expertise in helping to develop their own trainings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlene A.

Her work has a powerful recurring theme of building coalitions between groups with very different experiences of [[marginalization]], united under the banner of undoing the power structure that underpin each of their oppressions. As a queer black woman, Carruthers' experiences uniquely equip her to bind together the often-disjointed currents of feminist, LGBTQ, and racial justice activism. Her work has also consistently involved transnational collaborations and bridge building, including her work with immigrant advocacy groups and her participation in a historic delegation of black activists to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] aimed at fostering personal and organizational ties between Palestinian and African American justice advocates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Kristian Davis|title=Dream Defenders, Black Lives Matter & Ferguson Reps Take Historic Trip to Palestine|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/dream-defenders-black-lives-matter-ferguson-reps-take-historic-trip-to-palestine|date=2015-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==Black Youth Project 100==\n\nIn July 2013, Carruthers was one of 100 black millennial activist leaders from across the country assembled by the Black Youth Project in Chicago for a meeting aimed at building networks of organization for black youth activism across the country. On the second day of that meeting news from Florida announced the acquittal of [[George Zimmerman]] on an all charges relating to his February 26, 2012 [[killing of Trayvon Martin]]. This verdict galvanized Carruthers and the other activists into the formation of the Black Youth Project 100 to organize young black activism in resistance to structural oppressions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holliday |first=Darryl |title=The New Black Power |url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/March-2016/black-leaders/ |publisher=Chicago Mag |date=2016-02-22 |access-date = 18 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThough initially hesitant to assume the role of national coordinator herself, Carruthers ultimately came to realize the rare opportunity afforded by the erupting turmoil.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Jamia |title=Why Can't I Be You: Charlene Carruthers |url=http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/01/why-cant-i-be-you-charlene-carruthers/ |date=2015-01-30 |access-date = 18 May 2019}}</ref> The [[BYP100]] invests heavily in the training of leaders and the teaching of reformers, empowering a generation of black activism.

Her work aims to create young leaders in marginalized communities to fight for community interests and liberation. Carruthers' career in justice advocacy spans over ten years, working with some high-profile activist organizations including [[Color of Change]] and [[Women's Media Center]]. She was an integral member in the creation of the Black Youth Project 100, and has served as National Director or National Coordinator since the organization's founding in 2013. Carruthers is the author of ''Unapologetic: A Black, Queer, and Feminist Mandate for Radical Movements'' published by Penguin Random House in 2018. \n\n==Developing leadership==\n\nMuch of Carruthers' work in social activism centers on developing broad based political participation and leadership for marginalized communities. Several political organizations including [[Wellstone Action]] and the [[NAACP]] have called upon her energy and expertise in helping to develop their own trainings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlene A.

Her work has a powerful recurring theme of building coalitions between groups with very different experiences of [[marginalization]], united under the banner of undoing the power structure that underpin each of their oppressions. As a queer black woman, Carruthers' experiences uniquely equip her to bind together the often-disjointed currents of feminist, LGBTQ, and racial justice activism. Her work has also consistently involved transnational collaborations and bridge building, including her work with immigrant advocacy groups and her participation in a historic delegation of black activists to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] aimed at fostering personal and organizational ties between Palestinian and African American justice advocates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Kristian Davis|title=Dream Defenders, Black Lives Matter & Ferguson Reps Take Historic Trip to Palestine|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/dream-defenders-black-lives-matter-ferguson-reps-take-historic-trip-to-palestine|date=2015-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==Black Youth Project 100==\n\nIn July 2013, Carruthers was one of 100 black millennial activist leaders from across the country assembled by the Black Youth Project in Chicago for a meeting aimed at building networks of organization for black youth activism across the country.
