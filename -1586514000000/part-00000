Melbourne made a bid for the 1988 Summer Games, but withdrew in February 1981. [[Brisbane]] made a bid for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], losing out to [[Barcelona]] while Melbourne finished fourth in the bidding for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] won by [[Atlanta]]. The first serious review for Sydney as an Olympic city took place in 1973 on rehabilitating the [[Homebush Bay]] area as an Olympic site though those plans were not taken seriously until seven years later when Sydney was making a preliminary bid for the 1988 Summer Games. [[Nick Greiner]], who served as [[Premier of New South Wales]] from 1988 to 1992, led the effort to use the Olympics as a catalyst for rehabilitating Homebush Bay, forming a review committee on this in 1989. The [[Australian Olympic Committee]] endorsed this idea provisionally in December 1990 and officially three months later.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf |date=November 9, 2000 }} Volume 1. pp. 7-14.

The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man.

Shortly after they met, Icke left home following one of a number of frequent arguments he had started having with his father.

Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93\u201395, 99\u2013100.</ref> He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.</ref>\n\nIcke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.</ref> His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short-lived\u2014he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him\u2014but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.</ref> Icke was by then a household name, but has said that a career in television began to lose its appeal to him; he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.<ref>Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.</ref> \n\nIn August 1990 his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the \"poll tax\"), a local tax [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government introduced that year.
