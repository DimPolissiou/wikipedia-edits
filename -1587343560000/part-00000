The reserves represent different [[biogeography|biogeographic]] regions of the United States.  The National Estuarine Research Reserve System protects more than 1.3 million acres of coastal and estuarine habitats for long-term research, water-quality monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFor thousands of years, coastal and estuarine environments have provided people with food, safe harbors, transportation access, flood control, and a place to play and relax. The pressures on the nation's coast are enormous and the impacts on economies and ecosystems are becoming increasingly evident. Severe storms, climate change, pollution, habitat alteration and rapid population growth threaten the ecological functions that have supported coastal communities throughout history. [[Estuaries]] are the connection between the ocean (or Great Lakes) and the land and humans depend on both for their very existence, so caring for both \u2013 and the connection between them \u2013 is vital to humans.\n\nThe System was established by the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA) of 1972 as estuarine sanctuaries and was renamed to estuarine research reserves in the 1988 reauthorization of the CZMA.  NOAA provides funding, national guidance and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners.\n\nReserve staff work with local communities and regional groups to address natural resource management issues, such as non-point source pollution, habitat restoration and invasive species. Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with these coastal resource issues. Reserves provide adult audiences with training on estuarine issues of concern in their local communities, offer field classes for K-12 students, and provide estuary education to teachers through the Teachers on the Estuary program. Reserves also provide long-term water quality monitoring as well as opportunities for both scientists and graduate students to conduct research in a \"living laboratory\".\n\n==Core Programs==\n\n===Research and Monitoring===\nThe National Estuarine Research Reserves serve as living laboratories to support coastal research and long-term monitoring and to provide facilities for on-site staff, visiting scientists and graduate students. They also serve as reference sites for comparative studies on coastal topics such as ecosystem dynamics, human influences on estuarine systems, habitat conservation and restoration, species management, and social science. Additionally, the reserves serve as sentinel sites to better understand the effects of climate change.\n\nThe goals of the Reserve System's research and monitoring program include:\n*ensuring a stable environment for research through long-term protection of Reserve resources\n*addressing coastal management issues through coordinated estuarine research within the System\n*collecting information necessary for improved understanding and management of estuarine areas, and making the information available to stakeholders\n\nEach reserve works on a variety of research projects, in addition to participating in the [[#System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP)|System-wide Monitoring Program]]. The topics of these projects are varied and depend on local needs and issues, as well as issues of national concern.  Topics may include issues such as investigating the impacts of non-point source pollution, understanding the role of social science in coastal resource management, and controlling invasive species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/research/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n====System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP)====\nThe System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP, pronounced \u201cswamp\u201d) was established in 1995 as a means of observing short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine regions.  Each reserve participates in SWMP which provides researchers, resource managers, educators, and other coastal decision makers with standardized, quantitative measures to determine how reserve conditions are changing. By using standard operating procedures for each component across all 29 reserves, SWMP data helps establish the reserves as a system of national reference sites, as well a network of sentinel sites for detecting and understanding the effects of climate change in coastal regions.\n\nSWMP currently has three major components that focus on:\n*abiotic indicators of water quality and weather\n*biological monitoring\n*watershed, habitat, and land use mapping\n\nAbiotic parameters include nutrients, temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and in some cases, contaminants. Biological monitoring includes measures of biodiversity, habitat, and population characteristics. Watershed and land use classifications provide information on types of land use by humans and changes in land cover associated with each reserve.\nSWMP data for each reserve are managed by the [http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/ Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO)], which is managed through a grant to the University of South Carolina and is housed at the North Inlet-Winyah Bay Reserve in South Carolina.  SWMP data can be viewed and downloaded from the CDMO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/swmp/|title=NOAA: System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) Graphing Application|website=coast.noaa.gov|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n====NERRS Science Collaborative====\nThe NERRS Science Collaborative is designed to put Reserve-based science to work for local communities. Administered by the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan] (UM), the program funds research projects that bring scientists, intended users of the science, stakeholders, educators, and trainers together to address problems related to coastal pollution and habitat degradation in the context of climate change. The results of these projects is shared throughout the System.

The reserve system takes a local approach in advancing estuarine education and generating meaningful experiences for all kinds of people interested in learning about, protecting and restoring estuaries.\n\nThe Estuary Education Program strives to enhance student, teacher, and public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of estuaries by providing hands-on, investigative field experiences, curriculum and information material, multi-exposure opportunities, teacher training programs, and public outreach events.  The Estuary Education Network is working to advance estuary, climate & ocean literacy. Estuaries can be used as a powerful context to support learning about the interconnections and interdependencies between terrestrial and ocean systems, what important services they provide for humans, and how to restore and protect them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/education/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\nThe National Estuarine Research Reserve System's Coastal Training Program (CTP) was formally initiated in 2001 to provide up-to-date scientific information and skill-building opportunities to the people who are responsible for making decisions affecting coastal lands and waters of the United States. Through this program, National Estuarine Research Reserves can ensure that coastal decision-makers have the knowledge and tools they need to address critical resource management issues of concern to local communities. Coastal Training Programs offered by reserves focus on issues such as stormwater management, community development, restoration science, land use planning and others.  Since 2006, these reserve-based programs have delivered more than 400 evaluated training events reaching at least 13,000 decision-makers in the coastal zone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/training/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Stewardship===\nA core mission of the Reserves is to protect and conserve the more than 1.3 million acres of coastal and estuarine habitat within reserves and to facilitate improved stewardship of coastal habitats outside reserve boundaries. The Reserve System's stewardship approach uses the best available science to maintain and restore healthy, productive and resilient ecosystems, and disseminates information to regional and national stakeholders. Site-based stewardship strategies assess and respond to threats from coastal development, human use of reserve resources, climate change, and invasive species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/stewardship/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n====Stewardship Issues Addressed by NERRS====\n:;Invasive Species\nInvasive species are species not native to an ecosystem, and whose introduction to that ecosystem can harm the environment, public health or welfare. Reserves manage for invasive species through preventing new introductions and through managed removal if appropriate.\n\n:;Species of Concern\nReserves manage and restore habitat to support species of concern by restoring degraded habitat, enhancing habitat connectivity to support multiple life stages of particular species, managing visitor use pressure during critical life stages and restoring species and habitats such as native oysters and sea grass beds where possible.  Reserves also work within the watershed to identify, protect, and restore critical habitat for estuarine species such as salmon.\n\n:;Fire Management\nMany reserves manage habitat that require fire to survive.  Fire management through prescribed burns is particularly challenging as these areas often are located near development.  Many reserves manage these fire dependent habitats and monitor habitat and species recovery.\n\n:;Hydrologic Restoration\nDevelopment along our nation's estuaries often results in hydrologic restrictions from roads, dykes, and railroads.  These restrictions alter habitat, water quality, and species distribution.  Many reserves are addressing these impacts by managing or restoring hydrology through the replacement of culverts, management of tide gates, and/or removal of dykes.\n\n:;Water Quality\nWater quality is a fundamental indicator of the impacts from coastal watersheds and the health of estuarine ecosystems.  Good water quality affects coastal habitat quality and human communities that rely on estuaries for recreation and livelihoods. Water quality parameters such as clarity, oxygen content, nutrient concentration, temperature, sedimentation, pH,  salinity and others all have profound impacts on natural and human communities in coastal ecosystems.\n\nThe reserves are addressing water quality through intensive abiotic monitoring of estuarine habitats through the System-Wide Monitoring Program, working with farmers to develop and monitor best management practices from agriculture, monitoring the impacts of canopy cover on salmon habitats, addressing sedimentation impacts into coastal streams by working with adjacent land owners and evaluating land use impacts through tools such as the Non-Point Source Pollution, Erosion and Control (NSPECT ) tool.\n\n:;Habitat Alteration\nCoastal and estuarine habitats include marshes, forested wetlands, oyster reefs, seagrass beds, beaches, tidal streams, and riparian forests. These habitats are vital not only for fish, birds, and other wildlife, but for human communities as well. They help to protect against flooding, improve water quality, provide recreational opportunities, and support commercial fisheries and tourism.  Restoring habitats helps ecosystems by removing pollutants and invasive species, re-establishing natural ecosystem processes, and re-introducing native plants and other wildlife.\n\nThe Reserves are working with several NOAA programs and a variety of regional partners to improve the science in support of habitat restoration, restore coastal habitats, control invasive species, protect habitat through acquisition, and implement land management practices that balance the needs for conservation and public access.\n\n:;Habitat Mapping and Change\nThe Reserve System's Habitat Mapping and Change Plan was developed in 2007 to establish the framework for mapping habitats in reserves for long-term change related to local sea level change and human-caused stress from reserve watersheds.\nThe habitat mapping and change plan is supported by additional documents including the NERR Land Cover and Habitat Classification System and associated implementation protocols and documentation.\n\n:;Restoration\nAs living laboratories, the reserves are ideal settings to investigate the restoration and protection of estuarine and coastal habitat.  Because of their federally protected status, biogeographic diversity, on-site facilities, long-term monitoring programs and data, and professional staff capabilities in science and education, the reserves are excellent platforms for advancing the science of restoration, staging demonstration restoration projects, and monitoring their long-term response.  Most reserves have extensive areas of undisturbed habitat. These are useful as long-term scientific reference sites for understanding estuarine ecosystems and comparing them with other more disturbed habitats in similar physical settings.\n\nTo date, the majority of the reserves have engaged in restoration science and have planned or conducted small to medium-scale restoration projects (.5 to 250 acres).  An inventory of key habitats at the reserves and restoration activities and priorities conducted in 2000 and updated in 2001 is summarized in the NERRS Restoration Science Strategy.  Reserves have investigated both engineering and natural approaches to restore areas to approximate natural, unaltered conditions.  Several reserves must first address water quality issues and/or restore hydrologic regimes (i.e. sheet flow, tidal exchange, and freshwater drainage) before they can restore terrestrial and aquatic native plant communities and achieve faunal and ecological recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/stewardship/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Current Reserves==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Sortable table\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Reserve\n! scope=\"col\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" | Designation Year\n|-\n|[[Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Florida]] || 1979\n|-\n|[[Ashepoo Combahee Edisto Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[South Carolina]] || 1992\n|-\n|[[Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (Maryland)]] || [[Maryland]] || 1985\n|-\n|[[Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (Virginia)]] || [[Virginia]] || 1991\n|-\n|[[Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Delaware]] || 1993\n|-\n|[[Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[California]] || 1979\n|-\n|[[Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Mississippi]] || 1999\n|-\n|[[Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[New Hampshire]] || 1989\n|-\n|[[Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Florida]] || 1999\n|-\n|[https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/hawaii.html He\u2018eia National Estuarine Research Reserve] || [[Hawai\u2018i (state)|Hawai\u2018i]] || 2017\n|-\n|[[Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[New York (state)|New York]] || 1982\n|-\n|[[Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[New Jersey]] || 1998\n|-\n|[[Bah\u00eda de Jobos|Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Puerto Rico]] || 1981\n|-\n|[[Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Alaska]] || 1999\n|-\n|[[Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Wisconsin]] || 2011\n|-\n|[[Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Texas]] || 2006\n|-\n|[[Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Rhode Island]] || 1989\n|-\n|[[North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[North Carolina]] || 1985\n|-\n|[[North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[South Carolina]] || 1992\n|-\n|[[Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Ohio]] || 1980\n|-\n|[[Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Washington (state)|Washington]] || 1980\n|-\n|[[Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Florida]] || 1978\n|-\n|[[San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[California]] || 2003\n|-\n|[[Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] || 1976\n|-\n|[[South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Oregon]] || 1974\n|-\n|[[Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[California]] || 1981\n|-\n|[[Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Massachusetts]] || 1988\n|-\n|[[Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Alabama]] || 1986\n|-\n|[[Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Maine]] || 1984\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)]]\n*[[Keewaydin Island]]\n*[[Marco Island]]\n*[[Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation]]\n*[[Coastal Zone Management Act]]\n{{Commons category|National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224205227/http://mpa.gov/mpaservices/inv_status/sup_nerrsextended.html MPA listing]\n*[https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/ National Estuarine Research Reserve System]\n*[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?op_0=eq&v_0=National%20Ocean%20Service-National%20Estuarine%20Research%20Reserve%20System-Wide%20Monitoring%20Program&op_1=l&t=400239&s=51&d=307&d=305&d=301&d=303&d=416&d=304&d=302&d=308&no_data=suppress&sourceId=101717 National Estuarine Research Reserve System on NOSA]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States}}\n{{US Protected Areas}}\n\n[[Category:Protected areas of the United States]]\n[[Category:National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Wetlands of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Network of 29 protected areas}}\n{{Infobox Government agency\n|agency_name     = National Estuarine Research Reserve System\n|type            = Agency\n|nativename      = NERRS\n|nativename_a    = \n|nativename_r    = \n|logo            = NERRS logo with words.jpg\n|logo_width      = 280px\n|logo_caption    = \n|seal            = \n|seal_width      = \n|seal_caption    = \n|picture         = \n|picture_width   = \n|picture_caption = \n|formed          = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto;

The reserves represent different [[biogeography|biogeographic]] regions of the United States.  The National Estuarine Research Reserve System protects more than 1.3 million acres of coastal and estuarine habitats for long-term research, water-quality monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFor thousands of years, coastal and estuarine environments have provided people with food, safe harbors, transportation access, flood control, and a place to play and relax. The pressures on the nation\u2019s coast are enormous and the impacts on economies and ecosystems are becoming increasingly evident. Severe storms, climate change, pollution, habitat alteration and rapid population growth threaten the ecological functions that have supported coastal communities throughout history. [[Estuaries]] are the connection between the ocean (or Great Lakes) and the land and humans depend on both for their very existence, so caring for both \u2013 and the connection between them \u2013 is vital to humans.\n\nThe System was established by the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA) of 1972 as estuarine sanctuaries and was renamed to estuarine research reserves in the 1988 reauthorization of the CZMA.  NOAA provides funding, national guidance and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners.\n\nReserve staff work with local communities and regional groups to address natural resource management issues, such as non-point source pollution, habitat restoration and invasive species. Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with these coastal resource issues. Reserves provide adult audiences with training on estuarine issues of concern in their local communities, offer field classes for K-12 students, and provide estuary education to teachers through the Teachers on the Estuary program. Reserves also provide long-term water quality monitoring as well as opportunities for both scientists and graduate students to conduct research in a \"living laboratory\".\n\n==Core Programs==\n\n===Research and Monitoring===\nThe National Estuarine Research Reserves serve as living laboratories to support coastal research and long-term monitoring and to provide facilities for on-site staff, visiting scientists and graduate students.

Several reserves must first address water quality issues and/or restore hydrologic regimes (i.e. sheet flow, tidal exchange, and freshwater drainage) before they can restore terrestrial and aquatic native plant communities and achieve faunal and ecological recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/stewardship/|title=National Estuarine Research Reserve System|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Current Reserves==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Sortable table\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Reserve\n! scope=\"col\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" | Designation Year\n|-\n|[[Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Florida]] || 1979\n|-\n|[[Ashepoo Combahee Edisto Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[South Carolina]] || 1992\n|-\n|[[Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (Maryland)]] || [[Maryland]] || 1985\n|-\n|[[Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (Virginia)]] || [[Virginia]] || 1991\n|-\n|[[Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Delaware]] || 1993\n|-\n|[[Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[California]] || 1979\n|-\n|[[Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Mississippi]] || 1999\n|-\n|[[Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[New Hampshire]] || 1989\n|-\n|[[Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Florida]] || 1999\n|-\n|[https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/hawaii.html He\u2018eia National Estuarine Research Reserve] || [[Hawai\u2018i (state)|Hawai\u2018i]] || 2017\n|-\n|[[Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[New York (state)|New York]] || 1982\n|-\n|[[Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[New Jersey]] || 1998\n|-\n|[[Bah\u00eda de Jobos|Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Puerto Rico]] || 1981\n|-\n|[[Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Alaska]] || 1999\n|-\n|[[Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Wisconsin]] || 2011\n|-\n|[[Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Texas]] || 2006\n|-\n|[[Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Rhode Island]] || 1989\n|-\n|[[North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[North Carolina]] || 1985\n|-\n|[[North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[South Carolina]] || 1992\n|-\n|[[Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Ohio]] || 1980\n|-\n|[[Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Washington (state)|Washington]] || 1980\n|-\n|[[Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Florida]] || 1978\n|-\n|[[San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[California]] || 2003\n|-\n|[[Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] || 1976\n|-\n|[[South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Oregon]] || 1974\n|-\n|[[Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[California]] || 1981\n|-\n|[[Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Massachusetts]] || 1988\n|-\n|[[Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Alabama]] || 1986\n|-\n|[[Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve]] || [[Maine]] || 1984\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)]]\n*[[Keewaydin Island]]\n*[[Marco Island]]\n*[[Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation]]\n*[[Coastal Zone Management Act]]\n{{Commons category|National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224205227/http://mpa.gov/mpaservices/inv_status/sup_nerrsextended.html MPA listing]\n*[https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/ National Estuarine Research Reserve System]\n*[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?op_0=eq&v_0=National%20Ocean%20Service-National%20Estuarine%20Research%20Reserve%20System-Wide%20Monitoring%20Program&op_1=l&t=400239&s=51&d=307&d=305&d=301&d=303&d=416&d=304&d=302&d=308&no_data=suppress&sourceId=101717 National Estuarine Research Reserve System on NOSA]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States}}\n{{US Protected Areas}}\n\n[[Category:Protected areas of the United States]]\n[[Category:National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Wetlands of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "I dream of horses", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Estuarine_Research_Reserve"}

Also, because it is on the windward side of the mountains, it is often cloudy, having 203 cloudy days per year.<ref name=\"Cloud days\">[http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/cldy.html Cloudiness - Mean Number of Days] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531113038/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/cldy.html |date=2012-05-31 }}.

That wind carries moist air from the lake, producing clouds and heavy snow squalls.\n\n==Surrounding communities==\nBrentwood has three borders, including [[Baldwin, Pennsylvania|Baldwin]] to the east and northeast, [[Whitehall, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Whitehall]] to the south and west, and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of [[Carrick (Pittsburgh)|Carrick]] to the northwest.\n\n==History==\nBrentwood, located approximately {{convert|6|mi|0}} from downtown [[Pittsburgh]] and is 101 years old, was once an integral part of [[Baldwin Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Baldwin Township]], which included the villages of Brentwood, Point View, and Whitehall.\n\nIn 1914, a group of citizens in the village of Brentwood took a set of grievances to the Baldwin Township Board of Commissioners, regarding the lack of sidewalks, sewers, fire protection, police, and a school house. Upon further disregard of these necessities from the township, a group of men from the village held a meeting on January 27, 1915, to discuss secession. After considerable discussion, the boundary lines of Brentwood were finalized by the Board of Trade. Building a sidewalk along [[Brownsville Road]] was the first official action taken by the Board of Trade. On November 6, 1915, the Quarter Sessions Court of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] decreed that Brentwood was officially seceded from Baldwin Township. The proceedings to incorporate were filed on May 15, 1916, creating the Borough of Brentwood.\n\nOn December 4, 1915, special elections were held to elect a [[burgess (title)|burgess]], auditors, justices of the peace, high constable, tax collector, assessor, and councilmen. Brentwood's first burgess was Bernard Kestner, sworn in on December 9, 1915. He served Brentwood for sixteen years. The board met monthly and continued to discuss necessary steps for the structure of the Borough.\n\nOn [[Labor Day]], 1928, the borough celebrated the official opening of the park, pool, and paving of Brownsville Road.<ref name=\"official site\">{{cite web | url =http://www.brentwoodborough.com/index.html | title =Brentwood Borough, Pennsylvania | accessdate =2007-11-25 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071103195023/http://www.brentwoodborough.com/index.html | archivedate =2007-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nA former councilman of Brentwood, [[Bob Cranmer]], served as an [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] commissioner, 1996\u20132000.

The [[population density]] was 7,237.2 people per square mile (2,786.9/km\u00b2). There were 4,895 housing units at an average density of 3,384.9 per square mile (1,303.4/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 97.95% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.54% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.24% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.54% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.01% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.21% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.52% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.69% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,658 households, out of which 26.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 11.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.7% were non-families. 35.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.95.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 21.2% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 31.7% from 25 to 44, 21.4% from 45 to 64, and 17.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $37,013, and the median income for a family was $48,552. Males had a median income of $36,097 versus $29,526 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $20,024. About 4.8% of families and 6.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 7.0% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.\n\n[[Image:Brownsville Road and Clairton Blvd.jpg|right|thumb|Brownsville Road and Clairton Boulevard]]\n[[Image:Brentwood3.JPG|right|thumb|Brentwood Avenue at East Bellecrest Avenue]]\n\n==Education==\nBrentwood is served by the Brentwood Borough School District.\n\nThe Court of Common Pleas appointed Brentwood's first school board who took charge of school business in July 1916, and the first group of teachers were hired that same year in September. Brentwood's first school was '''Moore Elementary School''', then only a four-room school house, which is still in use by children and teachers. Because Moore School was not sufficient in size for all the students in the Borough, '''Elroy School''' was built about three-quarters of a mile away toward [[Pittsburgh]], and renovations were completed in 1925 to both schools.\n\nThe first '''[[Brentwood High School (Brentwood, Pennsylvania)|Brentwood High School]]''' opened in the basement of Elroy School in September 1925 and only taught through ninth grade. The high school was newly built in 1932 adjacent to the current Brentwood Park; an addition was constructed in 1939 because of the increase in population, and once again in 1959. This renovation included more rooms and a new gymnasium.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Pennsylvania experienced a consolidation of school districts. Some wanted the Brentwood school district to be folded into the Baldwin-Whitehall district. However, this consolidation was never realized, and in 1972 a new four-story building containing classrooms and an indoor pool was constructed.\n\nIn the early 1990s the consensus on the School Board was to close Moore and Elroy schools and consolidate them into an expanded K-12th grade facility at the existing high school. An intense community debate on whether to close Moore and Elroy schools ensued with the supporters of preserving and rehabilitating Moore and Elroy prevailing. In 1997, the Board of Directors fully modernized and remodeled Elroy School and Moore School received two new additional classrooms. The district also built a new academic wing to the front of the 1939 building, and a second gymnasium was placed on the demolished third and fourth floors of the 1972 addition.\n\n'''St. Sylvester School''' was established in September 1948 as a large church, lunch room, and a small four-classroom Catholic elementary school.  St. Sylvester now serves as Brentwood's parochial elementary school, teaching children from preschool to 8th grade.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Many shops, restaurants, and offices are in the square, such as [[Giant Eagle]], [[Wendy's]], a post office, [[State Liquor Store]], [[Aspen Dental]], [[LA Nails]], [[Crazy Mocha]], and other businesses.\n\n===Historic resources===\n[[Brownsville Road]] follows the route of a [[pre-Columbian era]] Native American Indian trail and footpaths connecting [[Redstone Old Fort]] with the \"forks of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]\", a distance of {{convert|26|mi}}. It later became the road connecting Pittsburgh with [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], and from there via Nemacolin's Path to [[Virginia]] and points further east. It was a major route for travel by stagecoach and [[Conestoga wagon]].  The road was significant during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], particularly its southern half.  It has had several names over its history, including the Red Stone Road and the Brownsville Plank Road, or Southern Avenue.\n\nThe '''Point View Hotel''' dates back to 1832. General [[Andrew Jackson]] spent a night there before he entered Pittsburgh while campaigning for the presidency. General [[Zachary Taylor]] stopped for a night as well. President [[James Buchanan]] and Senator [[Thaddeus Stevens]] stayed on two occasions. Not only did the hotel have many guests who were quite important people, but the basement of the hotel was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]] during the 1850s. The hotel was then turned into a restaurant and bar until the property was sold and demolished in November 2006, as it was never officially recognized as a historic landmark.  A medical office building has been built on this site.\n\nThe '''John F. Slater Funeral Home''', formerly the White Hall Tavern, was another important place in Brentwood's history. In the earlier days of Brentwood's time, many city dwellers rode stagecoaches on [[Brownsville Road]], because this was the only major roadway connecting the cities of Pittsburgh and Brownsville. The White Hall Tavern was just a short walk to the race track which was once on the site of the South Hills Country Club, which is why many people from the city stopped here for relaxation.\n\nThe '''Windsor Hotel''' was opened in 1882. Although there was a fire sixteen years later, it was rebuilt and remained a popular place for vacationers.\n\nThe '''Davis Farm House''' was another historical place in Brentwood's history, although it was gained by the borough in 1968. The house and grounds became a senior citizens\u2019 recreation center. Much debate was encountered when it was considered being torn down to build a new firehouse and recreation room. Although the house had been considered a historical site by much of the town, it was eventually torn down, and the new fire house was built in place of the senior citizens\u2019 center.\n\nThe '''Cowan Farm House''' at 4111 Brownsville Road, is an example of the early architecture of Brentwood. The estate and farm comprised the property is located at 4111 Brownsville Road and much of the surrounding area. The early Cowan family was a major landowner in Brentwood.\n\n===Recreation facilities===\nThe [[Brentwood High School (Brentwood, Pennsylvania)|Brentwood High School]] Spartans play football, soccer, baseball, and softball, in the local park. Brentwood Borough opened the park and pool on July 4, 1928, but it was not until 1948 that the football stadium, track, four baseball fields, tennis courts, and basketball courts were built.\n\nIn 2013, the Brentwood Park underwent roughly $8 million in comprehensive improvements. The project was spearheaded by the Brentwood Park Initiative, the independent committee helping to raise funds and community awareness. The renovations included new turf to replace the grass field at Brentwood Stadium; a quarter-mile rubber track; an in-line dek hockey rink; new basketball and tennis courts; and energy-efficient lighting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smykla |title=A newsmaker you should know: Dentist fundraising for Brentwood Park rehab |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2013/10/31/Dentist-fundraising-for-Brentwood-Park-rehab-RESUME-A-newsmaker-you-should-know/stories/201310310106 |website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Brentwood Arboretum===\nThe arboretum was founded in 1997 by members of the community.  It is located on the grounds of the Brentwood School District, the Brentwood Library, and the Brentwood Park, and the land is owned by each respective body.  The collection of trees comprises extant and new specimens planted by the community, library, and school district.  Community members hope to extend the collection during the renovations at the park.\n\nThe collection includes:\n\n*Ginkgo ''([[Ginkgo Biloba]]):''  Three specimen trees directly in front of the middle-high school\n*Japanese Larch ''([[Larix kaempferi]]):'' Two specimens at the northern entrance to the middle-high school adjacent to the library\n*Goldenrain Tree ''([[Koelreuteria paniculata]]):''  Four specimens in front of the middle-high school\n*Tulip Tree ''([[Liriodendron tulipifera]]):''  Two specimen trees along Brownsville Road adjacent to the middle-high school\n*American Elm \"Princeton\" ''([[Ulmus americana]]):''  Eleven specimens along Brownsville and Pointview roads\n*Little Leaf Linden'' ([[Tilia cordata]]):''  Three specimens in front of the building facing Brownsville Road, including one planted in 1939\n*Red Maple ''([[Acer rubrum]]):''  Seven specimens in a line behind the old gymnasium\n*Dawn Redwood ''([[Metasequoia glyptostroboides]]):''  Three specimens between the library and its new wing\n*Mulberry  ''( [[Morus (plant)|''Morus'']] )''  One specimen to the right of the front auditorium doors of the high school\n*Norway Maple '' ([[Acer platanoides]] )''  One specimen at the corner of Park Drive and Brownsville Road in front of the library\n*Redbud ''([[Cercis]]):''  One specimen in front of the middle-high school\n*Spruce ''([[Picea]])''  Five specimens at the north side of the \"old gym\" of the high school and park\n*Slippery Elm ''([[Ulmus rubra]]):''  One specimen at Brownsville Road in front of the library\n*Silver Maple ''([[Acer saccharinum]]):''  Two specimens along Park Drive in front of the library\n*American Sycamore ''([[Platanus occidentalis]]):''  Two specimens along Brownsville Road in front of the library\n\n===Library===\nBrentwood's public library is located at the center of the borough on Brownsville Road,  at the entrance of Brentwood Park. A person can borrow books, movies, puppets, puzzles, magazines, and CDs. There is a children's area, and there are many computers for public access to the internet. The library hosts many children's events throughout the year including story times and visitations by authors. For adults the library hosts educational classes, informational meetings and book clubs.\n\nThe library was founded in 1947 as a project of the Moore School P.T.A. Originally the library was in the basement of the Moore School. The library then moved to the Brentwood Borough building in the area currently occupied by the Brentwood EMS. On July 4, 1990, the library moved to the existing facility which was newly built with a main reading room, meeting rooms, and community room.\n\n===Public safety===\nThe fire department was organized on December 8, 1915. In 1916, the police department, which was formed only of two men, was developed. In 1977, the EMS was founded.\n\n==References==\n<!-- This article uses [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]].

Also, because it is on the windward side of the mountains, it is often cloudy, having 203 cloudy days per year.<ref name=\"Cloud days\">[http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/cldy.html Cloudiness - Mean Number of Days] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531113038/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/cldy.html |date=2012-05-31 }}.

That wind carries moist air from the lake, producing clouds and heavy snow squalls.\n\n==Surrounding communities==\nBrentwood has three borders, including [[Baldwin, Pennsylvania|Baldwin]] to the east and northeast, [[Whitehall, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Whitehall]] to the south and west, and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of [[Carrick (Pittsburgh)|Carrick]] to the northwest.\n\n==History==\nBrentwood, located approximately {{convert|6|mi|0}} from downtown [[Pittsburgh]] and is 101 years old, was once an integral part of [[Baldwin Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Baldwin Township]], which included the villages of Brentwood, Point View, and Whitehall.\n\nIn 1914, a group of citizens in the village of Brentwood took a set of grievances to the Baldwin Township Board of Commissioners, regarding the lack of sidewalks, sewers, fire protection, police, and a school house. Upon further disregard of these necessities from the township, a group of men from the village held a meeting on January 27, 1915, to discuss secession. After considerable discussion, the boundary lines of Brentwood were finalized by the Board of Trade. Building a sidewalk along [[Brownsville Road]] was the first official action taken by the Board of Trade. On November 6, 1915, the Quarter Sessions Court of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] decreed that Brentwood was officially seceded from Baldwin Township. The proceedings to incorporate were filed on May 15, 1916, creating the Borough of Brentwood.\n\nOn December 4, 1915, special elections were held to elect a [[burgess (title)|burgess]], auditors, justices of the peace, high constable, tax collector, assessor, and councilmen. Brentwood's first burgess was Bernard Kestner, sworn in on December 9, 1915. He served Brentwood for sixteen years. The board met monthly and continued to discuss necessary steps for the structure of the Borough.\n\nOn [[Labor Day]], 1928, the borough celebrated the official opening of the park, pool, and paving of Brownsville Road.<ref name=\"official site\">{{cite web | url =http://www.brentwoodborough.com/index.html | title =Brentwood Borough, Pennsylvania | accessdate =2007-11-25 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071103195023/http://www.brentwoodborough.com/index.html | archivedate =2007-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nA former councilman of Brentwood, [[Bob Cranmer]], served as an [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] commissioner, 1996\u20132000.

The racial makeup of the borough was 97.95% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.54% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.24% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.54% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.01% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.21% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.52% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.69% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,658 households, out of which 26.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 11.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.7% were non-families. 35.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.95.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 21.2% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 31.7% from 25 to 44, 21.4% from 45 to 64, and 17.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $37,013, and the median income for a family was $48,552. Males had a median income of $36,097 versus $29,526 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $20,024. About 4.8% of families and 6.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 7.0% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.\n\n[[Image:Brownsville Road and Clairton Blvd.jpg|right|thumb|Brownsville Road and Clairton Boulevard]]\n[[Image:Brentwood3.JPG|right|thumb|Brentwood Avenue at East Bellecrest Avenue]]\n\n==Education==\nBrentwood is served by the Brentwood Borough School District.\n\nThe Court of Common Pleas appointed Brentwood's first school board who took charge of school business in July 1916, and the first group of teachers were hired that same year in September. Brentwood's first school was '''Moore Elementary School''', then only a four-room school house, which is still in use by children and teachers. Because Moore School was not sufficient in size for all the students in the Borough, '''Elroy School''' was built about three-quarters of a mile away toward [[Pittsburgh]], and renovations were completed in 1925 to both schools.\n\nThe first '''[[Brentwood High School (Brentwood, Pennsylvania)|Brentwood High School]]''' opened in the basement of Elroy School in September 1925 and only taught through ninth grade. The high school was newly built in 1932 adjacent to the current Brentwood Park; an addition was constructed in 1939 because of the increase in population, and once again in 1959. This renovation included more rooms and a new gymnasium.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Pennsylvania experienced a consolidation of school districts. Some wanted the Brentwood school district to be folded into the Baldwin-Whitehall district. However, this consolidation was never realized, and in 1972 a new four-story building containing classrooms and an indoor pool was constructed.\n\nIn the early 1990s the consensus on the School Board was to close Moore and Elroy schools and consolidate them into an expanded K-12th grade facility at the existing high school. An intense community debate on whether to close Moore and Elroy schools ensued with the supporters of preserving and rehabilitating Moore and Elroy prevailing. In 1997, the Board of Directors fully modernized and remodeled Elroy School and Moore School received two new additional classrooms. The district also built a new academic wing to the front of the 1939 building, and a second gymnasium was placed on the demolished third and fourth floors of the 1972 addition.\n\n'''St. Sylvester School''' was established in September 1948 as a large church, lunch room, and a small four-classroom Catholic elementary school.  St. Sylvester now serves as Brentwood's parochial elementary school, teaching children from preschool to 8th grade.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

This ranked 3rd highest/most expensive out of Allegheny County's 45 school districts [between Wilkinsburg SD (2nd  highest) and Penn Hills SD (4th highest)].<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=Allegheny County Treasurer|url=http://apps.alleghenycounty.us/website/millsd.asp|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Sites of interest==\n\n===Businesses===\nBrentwood has a neighborhood main street ([[Brownsville Road]]) with businesses like Co Go's, Keener's hardware store, Express Minimart, Creative Mode hair stylists, PNC Bank, Goodeelicious Sweet Shoppe, Kim's martial arts school, and many other shops that stretch from the southern border of the Pittsburgh area to the northern border of Whitehall Borough.\n\nMore recently, Brentwood Towne Square was built along Brownsville Road and [[Pennsylvania Route 51|Route 51]]. Many shops, restaurants, and offices are in the square, such as [[Giant Eagle]], [[Wendy's]], a post office, [[State Liquor Store]], [[Aspen Dental]], [[LA Nails]], [[Crazy Mocha]], and other businesses.\n\n===Historic resources===\n[[Brownsville Road]] follows the route of a [[pre-Columbian era]] Native American Indian trail and footpaths connecting [[Redstone Old Fort]] with the \"forks of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]\", a distance of {{convert|26|mi}}. It later became the road connecting Pittsburgh with [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], and from there via Nemacolin's Path to [[Virginia]] and points further east. It was a major route for travel by stagecoach and [[Conestoga wagon]].  The road was significant during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], particularly its southern half.  It has had several names over its history, including the Red Stone Road and the Brownsville Plank Road, or Southern Avenue.\n\nThe '''Point View Hotel''' dates back to 1832. General [[Andrew Jackson]] spent a night there before he entered Pittsburgh while campaigning for the presidency. General [[Zachary Taylor]] stopped for a night as well. President [[James Buchanan]] and Senator [[Thaddeus Stevens]] stayed on two occasions. Not only did the hotel have many guests who were quite important people, but the basement of the hotel was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]] during the 1850s. The hotel was then turned into a restaurant and bar until the property was sold and demolished in November 2006, as it was never officially recognized as a historic landmark.  A medical office building has been built on this site.\n\nThe '''John F. Slater Funeral Home''', formerly the White Hall Tavern, was another important place in Brentwood's history. In the earlier days of Brentwood's time, many city dwellers rode stagecoaches on [[Brownsville Road]], because this was the only major roadway connecting the cities of Pittsburgh and Brownsville. The White Hall Tavern was just a short walk to the race track which was once on the site of the South Hills Country Club, which is why many people from the city stopped here for relaxation.\n\nThe '''Windsor Hotel''' was opened in 1882. Although there was a fire sixteen years later, it was rebuilt and remained a popular place for vacationers.\n\nThe '''Davis Farm House''' was another historical place in Brentwood's history, although it was gained by the borough in 1968. The house and grounds became a senior citizens\u2019 recreation center. Much debate was encountered when it was considered being torn down to build a new firehouse and recreation room. Although the house had been considered a historical site by much of the town, it was eventually torn down, and the new fire house was built in place of the senior citizens\u2019 center.\n\nThe '''Cowan Farm House''' at 4111 Brownsville Road, is an example of the early architecture of Brentwood. The estate and farm comprised the property is located at 4111 Brownsville Road and much of the surrounding area. The early Cowan family was a major landowner in Brentwood.\n\n===Recreation facilities===\nThe [[Brentwood High School (Brentwood, Pennsylvania)|Brentwood High School]] Spartans play football, soccer, baseball, and softball, in the local park. Brentwood Borough opened the park and pool on July 4, 1928, but it was not until 1948 that the football stadium, track, four baseball fields, tennis courts, and basketball courts were built.\n\nIn 2013, the Brentwood Park underwent roughly $8 million in comprehensive improvements. The project was spearheaded by the Brentwood Park Initiative, the independent committee helping to raise funds and community awareness. The renovations included new turf to replace the grass field at Brentwood Stadium; a quarter-mile rubber track; an in-line dek hockey rink; new basketball and tennis courts; and energy-efficient lighting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smykla |title=A newsmaker you should know: Dentist fundraising for Brentwood Park rehab |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2013/10/31/Dentist-fundraising-for-Brentwood-Park-rehab-RESUME-A-newsmaker-you-should-know/stories/201310310106 |website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Brentwood Arboretum===\nThe arboretum was founded in 1997 by members of the community.  It is located on the grounds of the Brentwood School District, the Brentwood Library, and the Brentwood Park, and the land is owned by each respective body.  The collection of trees comprises extant and new specimens planted by the community, library, and school district.  Community members hope to extend the collection during the renovations at the park.\n\nThe collection includes:\n\n*Ginkgo ''([[Ginkgo Biloba]]):''  Three specimen trees directly in front of the middle-high school\n*Japanese Larch ''([[Larix kaempferi]]):'' Two specimens at the northern entrance to the middle-high school adjacent to the library\n*Goldenrain Tree ''([[Koelreuteria paniculata]]):''  Four specimens in front of the middle-high school\n*Tulip Tree ''([[Liriodendron tulipifera]]):''  Two specimen trees along Brownsville Road adjacent to the middle-high school\n*American Elm \"Princeton\" ''([[Ulmus americana]]):''  Eleven specimens along Brownsville and Pointview roads\n*Little Leaf Linden'' ([[Tilia cordata]]):''  Three specimens in front of the building facing Brownsville Road, including one planted in 1939\n*Red Maple ''([[Acer rubrum]]):''  Seven specimens in a line behind the old gymnasium\n*Dawn Redwood ''([[Metasequoia glyptostroboides]]):''  Three specimens between the library and its new wing\n*Mulberry  ''( [[Morus (plant)|''Morus'']] )''  One specimen to the right of the front auditorium doors of the high school\n*Norway Maple '' ([[Acer platanoides]] )''  One specimen at the corner of Park Drive and Brownsville Road in front of the library\n*Redbud ''([[Cercis]]):''  One specimen in front of the middle-high school\n*Spruce ''([[Picea]])''  Five specimens at the north side of the \"old gym\" of the high school and park\n*Slippery Elm ''([[Ulmus rubra]]):''  One specimen at Brownsville Road in front of the library\n*Silver Maple ''([[Acer saccharinum]]):''  Two specimens along Park Drive in front of the library\n*American Sycamore ''([[Platanus occidentalis]]):''  Two specimens along Brownsville Road in front of the library\n\n===Library===\nBrentwood's public library is located at the center of the borough on Brownsville Road,  at the entrance of Brentwood Park. A person can borrow books, movies, puppets, puzzles, magazines, and CDs. There is a children's area, and there are many computers for public access to the internet. The library hosts many children's events throughout the year including story times and visitations by authors. For adults the library hosts educational classes, informational meetings and book clubs.\n\nThe library was founded in 1947 as a project of the Moore School P.T.A. Originally the library was in the basement of the Moore School. The library then moved to the Brentwood Borough building in the area currently occupied by the Brentwood EMS. On July 4, 1990, the library moved to the existing facility which was newly built with a main reading room, meeting rooms, and community room.\n\n===Public safety===\nThe fire department was organized on December 8, 1915. In 1916, the police department, which was formed only of two men, was developed. In 1977, the EMS was founded.\n\n==References==\n<!-- This article uses [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]].

''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), p. 633.</ref> The song first charted on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart reaching number one for nine weeks, then hit number one on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for 11 weeks. It also reached number one on the [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart for five non-consecutive weeks, number four on the [[Adult Top 40]] chart, and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the band's highest-charting single there. \n\nThe main chorus of the song were sampled in the 2007 song \"[[Goodnight Goodnight (Maroon 5 song)|Goodnight Goodnight]]\" by band [[Maroon 5]].Well, I paid her for \naround the world \nto ease my  hurt behind\n\nI left my body lying somewhere \nButt spread open wide\nBut I watched the world float as I posed in a full moon\nI feel there's nothing I could do, yeah\nI watched the world float \nas I posed in the full moon\n\nAfter all I knew, it had to be something she would do \n\nI really don't mind this happens now and then\n\nAs long as she sticks it in my rear end\n\nIf I go crazy, then would you still  eat my but again?\nIf I'm alive and well, would you at least put one finger in?\n\nJust keep youre tongue inside of my superhuman tight\nGlutes tonite\n\nYou tongue me long \nyou tongue me deep \nUntil my semen starts to leak\nYou took for granted \nthat the best part was left running down\nYou stuck it in i came on the bed \n\nIf not for me bent over spread \n\nIde lick it up and spit it back into your mouth\n\nIf I go crazy, then will you still eat my but again ?\nIf I'm alive and well, will you at least put one finger in ?\nJust keep your tongue inside  my superhuman tight\nGlutes tonite\nIf I go crazy, then will you still eat my but again?\nIf I'm alive and well, would you at least put one finger in ?\nJust \n keep your tongue inside of my superhuman tight\n\nGlutes tonite\n\nAll around the world\nAll around the world\nAll around the world\n\n==Composition and inspiration==\nThe song was written by vocalist/drummer [[Brad Arnold]] in a mathematics class when he was fifteen and was one of the first songs he ever wrote.<ref name=\"songfacts.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/brad_arnold_from_3_doors_down/|title=Brad Arnold from 3 Doors Down : Songwriter Interviews|work=songfacts.com}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the song's meaning, Arnold has said:\n:\"That song seems like it's really just kind of like asking a question. Its question is kind of a strange one. It's not just asking, \"If I fall down, will you be there for me?\", because it's easy to be there for someone when they're down. But it's not always easy to be there for somebody when they're doing good. And that's the question it's asking. It's like, \"If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?\" It's asking, \"If I'm down, will you still be there for me?\" but at the same time, \"If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?\" That's kind of asking, \"If I'm doing good, will you be there for me? Will you not be jealous of me?\" That's the basic question that song's asking, and maybe throughout the years of singing that song, I might have come up with more meanings for it than it actually might have originally had.\"<ref name=\"songfacts.com\"/>\n\n==Music video==\nDirected by [[Dean Karr]], the [[music video]] presents an old man who was a big-time action hero on 1950s TV. The scene cuts between the band hanging around on the roof of the apartments where the old man lives, spying on a man harassing a woman. When the man drags her away, the old man dons his superhero suit and follows. In between shots of the old hero chasing the [[Villain|bad guy]] and failing to protect himself against a group of [[Goth subculture|goth]]s, the band is shown playing in a club (the Cowboy Palace Saloon in LA) with several other elderly people dressed as caricatures of comic villains. Several of these people are seen riding a mechanical bull during the final chorus. The video comes to a close when the old man dives through the skylight and catches the bad guy off guard, possibly knocking him out by falling on top of him. The video ends with the old man smiling, giving a thumbs up to the camera, having successfully completed his mission.\n\n==Live performances==\n\"Kryptonite\" was first performed live in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] on January 15, 1997.
