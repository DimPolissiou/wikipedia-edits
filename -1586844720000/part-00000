It is used mostly to learn foreign languages.\n\nThe theory applied positive [[suggestion]] in teaching when it was developed in the 1970s.

''The Practice of English Language Teaching. 3rd Edition.'' Person Education Limited, 2001</ref> and various techniques, including art and music, are used by the trained teachers.\nThe lesson of Suggestopedia consisted of three phases at first: deciphering, concert session (memorization s\u00e9ance), and elaboration.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref name=\"two\">Lozanov, Georgi. ''Suggestopaedia - Desuggestive Teaching Communicative Method on the Level of the Hidden Reserves of the Human Mind''. http://dr-lozanov.dir.bg/book/start_book.htm 4/30/2006</ref>\n\n'''Deciphering:''' The teacher introduces the grammar and lexis of the content. In most materials the foreign language text is on the left half of the page with a translation on the right half, i.e. meanings are conveyed via the mother tongue not unlike the [[bilingual method]].\n\n'''Concert session (active and passive):''' In the active session, the teacher reads the text at a normal speed, sometimes intoning some words, and the students follow. In the passive session, the students relax and listen to the teacher reading the text calmly. Baroque music is played in the background.\n\n'''Elaboration:'''\nThe students finish off what they have learned with dramas, songs, and games.\n\nThen it has developed into four phases as lots of experiments were done: introduction, concert session, elaboration, and production.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref name=\"two\"/>\n\n'''Introduction:''' The teacher teaches the material in \"a playful manner\" instead of analyzing lexis and grammar of the text in a directive manner.\n\n'''Concert session (active and passive):''' In the active session, the teacher reads with intoning as [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Musical_Selections_for_Suggestopedia_Concert_Sessions.pdf selected music] is played. Occasionally, the students read the text together with the teacher, and listen only to the music as the teacher pauses in particular moments. The passive session is done more calmly.\n\n'''Elaboration:''' The students sing classical songs and play games while \"the teacher acts more like a consultant\".<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n'''Production:''' The students spontaneously speak and interact in the target language without interruption or correction.\n\n==Teachers==\nTeachers should not act in a directive way, although this method is teacher-controlled and not student-controlled. For example, they should act as a real partner to the students, participating in the activities such as games and songs \"naturally\" and \"genuinely.\" <ref name=\"one\"/> In the concert session, they should fully include classical art in their behaviors. Although there are many techniques that the teachers use, factors such as \"communication in the spirit of love, respect for man as a human being, the specific humanitarian way of applying their 'techniques'\" etc. are crucial.<ref name=\"two\"/> The teachers not only need to know the techniques and to acquire the practical [[methodology]] completely, but also to fully understand the theory, because, if they implement those techniques without complete understanding, they will not be able to lead their learners to successful results, or they could even cause a negative impact on their learning. Therefore, the teacher has to be trained in a course taught by certified trainers.\n\nHere are the most important factors for teachers to acquire, described by Lozanov.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n# Covering a huge bulk of learning material.\n# Structuring the material in the suggestopaedic way: global-partial \u2013 partial-global, and global in the part \u2013 part in the global, related to the golden proportion.\n# As a professional, on one hand, and a personality, on the other hand, the teacher should be a highly regarded professional, reliable and credible.\n# The teacher should have, not play, a hundred percent expectation of positive results (because the teacher is already experienced even from the time of the teacher training course).\n# The teacher should love his/her students (of course, not sentimentally but as human beings) and teach them with personal participation through games, songs, classical arts, and pleasure.\n\n==Method for children (preventive Suggestopedia)==\nThe method for Adults includes long sessions without movement,<ref name=\"one\"/> and materials that are appropriate for adults. Children, however, get impacts from \"the social suggestive norms\" differently, and their brains are more delicate than those of adults. Therefore, another method with different materials should be applied to children, which better matches their characteristics. Lessons for children are more incidental and short, preventing the children from the negative pedagogical suggestions of Society. It is important to tell the parents about the method and their roles \u2013 because they could influence children both negatively and positively, depending on how they support the kids.<ref name=\"two\"/>\n\n==Side effects==\nLozanov claims that the effect of the method is not only in language learning, but also in producing favorable side effects on health, the social and psychological relations, and the subsequent success in other subjects.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSuggestopedia has been called a \"pseudo-science\".<ref name=\"richards\">Richards, J.C. and Rodgers, T.S. (2001). Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> It depends, in a sense, on the trust that students develop towards the method. Lozanov never admitted that Suggestopedia can be compared to a placebo. He argues, however, that placebos are indeed effective. Another point of criticism is brought forward by Baur, who claims that the students only receive input by listening, reading and musical-emotional backing, while other important factors of language acquisition are being neglected.<ref>Baur, R.S. (1984). Die Psychop\u00e4dische Variante der Suggestop\u00e4die (Psychop\u00e4die). In Bauer, H.L. (Ed.), Unterrichtspraxis und theoretische Fundierung in Deutsch als Fremdsprache. (pp. 291-326 ). M\u00fcnchen: Goethe-Institut.</ref> Furthermore, several other features of the method \u2013 like the 'nonconscious' acquisition of language, or bringing the learner into a childlike state \u2013 are questioned by critics.\n\nLukesch claims that Suggestopedia lacks scientific backing and is criticized by psychologists as being based on pseudoscience.<ref>Lukesch, H. (2000): Lernen ohne Anstrengung? Der Sirenengesang der geheimen Verf\u00fchrer. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr P\u00e4dagogische Psychologie/German Journal of Educational Psychology, 14, 59-62.</ref>\n\n==Later variations==\n\nSuggestopedia yielded four main offshoots. The first \u2013 still called Suggestopedia, and  developed in eastern Europe \u2013 used different techniques from Lozanov's original version. The other three are named ''[[Superlearning]]'', ''Suggestive Accelerated Learning and Teaching'' (SALT), and ''Psychop\u00e4die''.<ref name=\"Felix1989\">{{cite book | url=http://users.monash.edu.au/~ufelix/thesis2-7.htm | title=An Investigation of the Effects of Music, Relaxation and Suggestion in Second Language Acquisition in Schools | publisher=[[Flinders University]], Adelaide | type=PhD thesis | year=1989 | accessdate=January 12, 2012 | author=Felix, Uschi | pages=Chapter 2.7}}</ref> Superlearning and SALT originated in North America, while Psychop\u00e4die was developed in [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"Felix1989\" /> While all four are slightly different from the original Suggestopedia and from each other, they still share the common traits of music, relaxation, and suggestion.<ref name=\"Felix1989\" />\n\nThose variants of Suggestopedia mentioned above are too far from the original concept, and are based on the early experiments, which were left behind during the new improvements of the method.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Idiomos Aprendizagem Acelerada = http://www.idiomos.com\n*Edelmann, Walter, Suggestgop\u00e4die/Superlearning, Heidelberg: Ansanger, 1998.\n*Lozanov, Georgi, Suggestology and Outlines of Suggestopedy, New York: Gordon & Breach 1978 (Translation of: {{cite book |last=Lozanov |first=Georgi |date=1971 |title=Sugestologia |language=Bulgarian |location=Sofia |publisher=Nauka i izkustvo}}).\n*Meier, Josef, Mehr Freude und Erfolg beim Englischlernen mit innovativen Lern- und Mentaltechniken, M\u00fcnchen:IBS, 1999.\n*Riedel, Katja, Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsentfaltung durch Suggestop\u00e4die, Hohengehren: Schneider, 1995.\n*Schiffler, Ludger, Suggestop\u00e4die und Superlearning - empirisch gepr\u00fcft.

Person Education Limited, 2001</ref> and various techniques, including art and music, are used by the trained teachers.\nThe lesson of Suggestopedia consisted of three phases at first: deciphering, concert session (memorization s\u00e9ance), and elaboration.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref name=\"two\">Lozanov, Georgi. ''Suggestopaedia - Desuggestive Teaching Communicative Method on the Level of the Hidden Reserves of the Human Mind''. http://dr-lozanov.dir.bg/book/start_book.htm 4/30/2006</ref>\n\n'''Deciphering:''' The teacher introduces the grammar and lexis of the content. In most materials the foreign language text is on the left half of the page with a translation on the right half, i.e. meanings are conveyed via the mother tongue not unlike the [[bilingual method]].\n\n'''Concert session (active and passive):''' In the active session, the teacher reads the text at a normal speed, sometimes intoning some words, and the students follow. In the passive session, the students relax and listen to the teacher reading the text calmly. Baroque music is played in the background.\n\n'''Elaboration:'''\nThe students finish off what they have learned with dramas, songs, and games.\n\nThen it has developed into four phases as lots of experiments were done: introduction, concert session, elaboration, and production.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref name=\"two\"/>\n\n'''Introduction:''' The teacher teaches the material in \"a playful manner\" instead of analyzing lexis and grammar of the text in a directive manner.\n\n'''Concert session (active and passive):''' In the active session, the teacher reads with intoning as selected music is played. Occasionally, the students read the text together with the teacher, and listen only to the music as the teacher pauses in particular moments. The passive session is done more calmly.\n\n'''Elaboration:''' The students sing classical songs and play games while \"the teacher acts more like a consultant\".<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n'''Production:''' The students spontaneously speak and interact in the target language without interruption or correction.\n\n==Teachers==\nTeachers should not act in a directive way, although this method is teacher-controlled and not student-controlled. For example, they should act as a real partner to the students, participating in the activities such as games and songs \"naturally\" and \"genuinely.\" <ref name=\"one\"/> In the concert session, they should fully include classical art in their behaviors. Although there are many techniques that the teachers use, factors such as \"communication in the spirit of love, respect for man as a human being, the specific humanitarian way of applying their 'techniques'\" etc. are crucial.<ref name=\"two\"/> The teachers not only need to know the techniques and to acquire the practical [[methodology]] completely, but also to fully understand the theory, because, if they implement those techniques without complete understanding, they will not be able to lead their learners to successful results, or they could even cause a negative impact on their learning. Therefore, the teacher has to be trained in a course taught by certified trainers.\n\nHere are the most important factors for teachers to acquire, described by Lozanov.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n# Covering a huge bulk of learning material.\n# Structuring the material in the suggestopaedic way: global-partial \u2013 partial-global, and global in the part \u2013 part in the global, related to the golden proportion.\n# As a professional, on one hand, and a personality, on the other hand, the teacher should be a highly regarded professional, reliable and credible.\n# The teacher should have, not play, a hundred percent expectation of positive results (because the teacher is already experienced even from the time of the teacher training course).\n# The teacher should love his/her students (of course, not sentimentally but as human beings) and teach them with personal participation through games, songs, classical arts, and pleasure.\n\n==Method for children (preventive Suggestopedia)==\nThe method for Adults includes long sessions without movement,<ref name=\"one\"/> and materials that are appropriate for adults. Children, however, get impacts from \"the social suggestive norms\" differently, and their brains are more delicate than those of adults. Therefore, another method with different materials should be applied to children, which better matches their characteristics. Lessons for children are more incidental and short, preventing the children from the negative pedagogical suggestions of Society. It is important to tell the parents about the method and their roles \u2013 because they could influence children both negatively and positively, depending on how they support the kids.<ref name=\"two\"/>\n\n==Side effects==\nLozanov claims that the effect of the method is not only in language learning, but also in producing favorable side effects on health, the social and psychological relations, and the subsequent success in other subjects.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSuggestopedia has been called a \"pseudo-science\".<ref name=\"richards\">Richards, J.C. and Rodgers, T.S. (2001). Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> It depends, in a sense, on the trust that students develop towards the method. Lozanov never admitted that Suggestopedia can be compared to a placebo. He argues, however, that placebos are indeed effective. Another point of criticism is brought forward by Baur, who claims that the students only receive input by listening, reading and musical-emotional backing, while other important factors of language acquisition are being neglected.<ref>Baur, R.S. (1984). Die Psychop\u00e4dische Variante der Suggestop\u00e4die (Psychop\u00e4die). In Bauer, H.L. (Ed.), Unterrichtspraxis und theoretische Fundierung in Deutsch als Fremdsprache. (pp. 291-326 ). M\u00fcnchen: Goethe-Institut.</ref> Furthermore, several other features of the method \u2013 like the 'nonconscious' acquisition of language, or bringing the learner into a childlike state \u2013 are questioned by critics.\n\nLukesch claims that Suggestopedia lacks scientific backing and is criticized by psychologists as being based on pseudoscience.<ref>Lukesch, H. (2000): Lernen ohne Anstrengung? Der Sirenengesang der geheimen Verf\u00fchrer. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr P\u00e4dagogische Psychologie/German Journal of Educational Psychology, 14, 59-62.</ref>\n\n==Later variations==\n\nSuggestopedia yielded four main offshoots. The first \u2013 still called Suggestopedia, and  developed in eastern Europe \u2013 used different techniques from Lozanov's original version. The other three are named ''[[Superlearning]]'', ''Suggestive Accelerated Learning and Teaching'' (SALT), and ''Psychop\u00e4die''.<ref name=\"Felix1989\">{{cite book | url=http://users.monash.edu.au/~ufelix/thesis2-7.htm | title=An Investigation of the Effects of Music, Relaxation and Suggestion in Second Language Acquisition in Schools | publisher=[[Flinders University]], Adelaide | type=PhD thesis | year=1989 | accessdate=January 12, 2012 | author=Felix, Uschi | pages=Chapter 2.7}}</ref> Superlearning and SALT originated in North America, while Psychop\u00e4die was developed in [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"Felix1989\" /> While all four are slightly different from the original Suggestopedia and from each other, they still share the common traits of music, relaxation, and suggestion.<ref name=\"Felix1989\" />\n\nThose variants of Suggestopedia mentioned above are too far from the original concept, and are based on the early experiments, which were left behind during the new improvements of the method.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Idiomos Aprendizagem Acelerada = http://www.idiomos.com\n*Edelmann, Walter, Suggestgop\u00e4die/Superlearning, Heidelberg: Ansanger, 1998.\n*Lozanov, Georgi, Suggestology and Outlines of Suggestopedy, New York: Gordon & Breach 1978 (Translation of: {{cite book |last=Lozanov |first=Georgi |date=1971 |title=Sugestologia |language=Bulgarian |location=Sofia |publisher=Nauka i izkustvo}}).\n*Meier, Josef, Mehr Freude und Erfolg beim Englischlernen mit innovativen Lern- und Mentaltechniken, M\u00fcnchen:IBS, 1999.\n*Riedel, Katja, Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsentfaltung durch Suggestop\u00e4die, Hohengehren: Schneider, 1995.\n*Schiffler, Ludger, Suggestop\u00e4die und Superlearning - empirisch gepr\u00fcft.

Optimal induction times of ''Pichia'' are usually on the order of days, whereas ''E. coli'' usually reaches optimal yields within hours of induction.

However ''Pichia'' has two main advantages over ''S. cerevisiae'' in laboratory and industrial settings:\n\n#''Pichia'', as mentioned above, is a [[methylotroph]], meaning it can grow with the simple [[alcohol]] methanol as its only source of energy \u2014 ''Pichia'' can easily be grown in [[cell suspension]] in reasonably strong methanol solutions that would kill most other micro-organisms, a system that is cheap to set up and maintain.\n#''Pichia'' can grow to very high cell densities, and under ideal conditions can multiply to the point where the cell suspension is practically a paste. As the protein yield from expression in a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the protein produced per cell and the number of cells, this makes ''Pichia'' of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive equipment.<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\nCompared to other expression systems such as S2-cells from ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' or [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s, ''Pichia'' usually gives much better yields. Cell lines from multicellular organisms usually require complex rich media, including [[amino acids]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[growth factor]]s. These media significantly increase the cost of producing recombinant proteins. Additionally, since ''Pichia'' can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one [[nitrogen]] source, it is suitable for isotopic labelling applications in e.g. [[protein NMR]].<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q148697}}\n\n[[Category:Saccharomycetaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungal models]]\n[[Category:Yeasts]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1956]]\n", "text_old": "{{Italic title}}\n{{Taxobox \n| name = ''Pichia pastoris''\n| regnum = [[fungus|Fungi]]\n| phylum = [[Ascomycota]]\n| classis = [[Saccharomycetes]]\n| ordo = [[Saccharomycetales]]\n| familia = [[Saccharomycetaceae]]\n| genus = ''[[Pichia]]'' / ''[[Komagataella]]''\n| species = '''''pastoris'''''\n| binomial = ''Pichia pastoris''\n}}\n\n'''''Pichia pastoris''''' is a species of [[methylotroph]]ic [[yeast]].

As the protein yield from expression in a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the protein produced per cell and the number of cells, this makes ''Pichia'' of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive equipment.<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\nCompared to other expression systems such as S2-cells from ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' or [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s, ''Pichia'' usually gives much better yields. Cell lines from multicellular organisms usually require complex rich media, including [[amino acids]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[growth factor]]s. These media significantly increase the cost of producing recombinant proteins. Additionally, since ''Pichia'' can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one [[nitrogen]] source, it is suitable for isotopic labelling applications in e.g. [[protein NMR]].<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q148697}}\n\n[[Category:Saccharomycetaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungal models]]\n[[Category:Yeasts]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1956]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "ref tags fixed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichia_pastoris"}
