A close cousin of Natasha, Shehryar Aziz is a struggling drama actor. His two friends are Arshad (an aspiring director) and Shabbo. Shehryar is a commitment-phobe and hates it when his mother, Farida brings up the subject of getting him married.\n\nAt Natasha's wedding, he meets Natasha's cousin, Saniya who has come from Turkey. Shehryar is instantly smitten by her and he tries to flirt with her. At night, he takes Saniya to explore Karachi, the city of lights without informing anyone and the two fall in love. When Shehryar asks for her phone number, she jokes that given his nature, she would give him her phone number and then she would keep waiting for his calls and he will ignore her. She, nevertheless, gives him her number. Shehryar learns from Saniya that she would be leaving in two days and was here to Pakistan to attend Natasha's wedding and to drop her father, Faisal (who is a famous writer) with his family members in his homeland just as he wished.\n\nSaniya goes back to Turkey. Farida decides to join the drama industry just to 'pass time' which frustrates Shehryar immensely and in his frustration and his friends teasing him about Saniya, he ignores several calls and texts from her. As he is about to receive her call, he is mugged and Saniya comes to believe that Shehryar has used her.\n\n'''Chapter Two: Rustom's Wedding'''\n\nFaisal writes the script for a drama titled Parey Hut Love and informs Shehryar that he would be cast as the lead. Shehryar is overjoyed but has no one to finance the production of the film. Meanwhile, Farida makes it big in the industry and becomes famous. Rustom, a distant relative of Shehryar who is a Parsi proposes to Tanaaz, his cousin. Shehryar is elated to learn that Saniya has come for the wedding but is heartbroken when Saniya makes him meet her fianc\u00e9, Hassan. She deliberately attempts to make Shehryar jealous by openly praising Hassan.\n\nThe wedding takes place. Shehryar confronts Saniya after it and tells her that his phone was stolen. Saniya refuses to believe him and tells him that it is too late and that she will not leave Hassan at any cost.\n\nShehryar goes to several producers only to be repeatedly rejected for the script of parey hut love. Shehryar's stepfather (who is nicknamed by Shehryar as 'Half Dad') finances the production. Shehryar for the first time calls him 'dad'. \n\nThe production of Parey Hut Love begins but Saniya arrives to inform Shehryar of Faisal's increasing brain tumor and gives him the card for her wedding which is to take place in Kashmir, Faisal's hometown. This leads to a major fight between Sheheryar and Arshad who is more focused on his project. Shehryar leaves for Kashmir. Arshad follows him and they reunite. Shehryar tells Saniya that his biological father did not love him at all, even though Shehryar loved him and left him and his mother. Thus, he became a commitment phobe. \n\n'''Chapter Three: Saniya's Wedding'''\n\nSaniya's wedding arrives and Sheheryar falls into depression stemmed from Saniya's rejection. \nShehryar begs her to forgive him and marry him, to leave Hassan but Saniya implies that she can't. Meanwhile, Faisal passes away. The wedding is immediately postponed and the funeral is arranged. Saniya leaves in the misery caused by Faisal's death and Shehryar's fierce love for her.\n\n'''Chapter Four: Shehryar's wedding'''\n\nA few years later, Shehryar is a successful actor and is engaged to megastar, Zeena who loves him. Shehryar also reciprocates her feelings but still loves Saniya. Saniya tells Hassan that she is in love with Shehryar and breaks her engagement with him. Hassan forgives her and they continue as friends. Saniya, having learned of Shehryar's wedding (which is to take place in Turkey) from media reports, arrives at the wedding and tells Shehryar that she left Hassan because she told him that she loved someone else. Shehryar's feelings for Saniya rekindle. Zeena realizes Shehryar loves Saniya not heer after seeing Saniya leave his room.\nAt the wedding, Zeena motivates Shehryar to go after Saniya who was leaving for another city. Shehryar goes after her. Arshad and Shabbo express their liking for each other.\nShehryar finds Saniya and tells her that he left Zeena because she found out that he loved someone else. The movie ends on a happy note with Shehryar and Saniya embracing each other.\n\n<br />\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sheheryar Munawar]] as Sheheryar\n* [[Maya Ali]] as Saniya<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/333989-|title=Maya Ali to star opposite Sheheryar Munawar in Paray Hut Love|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=30 March 2019|work=The News}}</ref>\n* [[Ahmed Ali Butt]] as Arshad\n* [[Zara Noor Abbas]] as Shabbo<ref name=\"PHL1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/30/mahira-khan-sheheryar-munawar-zara-noor-abbas-to-star-in-asim-razas-next/|title=Mahira Khan, Sheheryar Munawar, Zara Noor Abbas to star in Asim Raza's next|date=30 March 2018|website=[[Pakistan Today]]|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Nadeem Baig (actor)|Nadeem Baig]] as Faisal\n* [[Hina Dilpazeer]] as Farida\n* Shahbaz Shigri as Hasan<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/parey-hut-love-is-a-romantic-melodrama-with-gloss-and-glamour/|title=Trailer Review: Parey Hut Love is a romantic melodrama with gloss and glamour|work=Something Haute|accessdate=22 June 2019|date=22 June 2019|author=Syeda Zehra}}</ref>\n* Munawar Alam Siddiqui as Aziz\n* [[Rachel Viccaji]] as Tanaaz\n* Faheem Azam as Rustom\n* Yousuf Bashir Qureshi as Mehmood\n* Frieha Altaf as Feroza<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/frieha-altaf-parey-hut-love/|title=Frieha Altaf joins the cast of 'Parey Hut Love' for a special role|work=Something Haute|accessdate=30 March 2019|date=8 November 2018|author=Shahjehan Saleem}}</ref>\n* Parisheh James<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181504|title=Parey Hut Love's shoot concludes with a star-studded wrap-up party|author=Maliha Rehman|date=18 December 2018|work=Dawn Images|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref> as Natasha<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1997852/4|title='Paray Hut Love' trailer explores typical boy-meets-girl love story|author=Haddiqua Siddiqui|date=22 June 2019|accessdate=22 June 2019|work=Dawn Images}}</ref>\n* Jimmy Khan as Anwar\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* [[Fawad Khan]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181382|title=Fawad Khan will make a special appearance in Parey Hut Love|date=1 December 2018|accessdate=1 December 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref>\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Zeena<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/385799-|title=\"Parey Hut Love was meant to be,\" says Maya Ali|date=25 October 2018|work=The News|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Marina Khan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181617|title=Parey Hut Love is a lighthearted love story with lots of subliminal layers, says Asim Raza|author=Maliha Rehman|date=7 January 2019|work=Dawn Images|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref> \n* [[Sonya Jehan]]\n* [[Imran Aslam (actor)|Imran Aslam]]\n* Cybil Chowdhry\n* [[Meera (actress)|Meera]] as Karishma Chaudhry\n* [[Saife Hassan]]\n* [[Durdana Butt]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Pre-production]] of the film began in July 2018, [[Sheheryar Munawar]] producing the film, wanted to cast [[Mahira Khan]] but due to date issues, she couldn't take the role.

A close cousin of Natasha, Shehryar Aziz is a struggling drama actor. His two friends are Arshad (an aspiring director) and Shabbo. Shehryar is a commitment-phobe and hates it when his mother, Farida brings up the subject of getting him married.\n\nAt Natasha's wedding, he meets Natasha's cousin, Saniya who has come from Turkey. Shehryar is instantly smitten by her and he tries to flirt with her. At night, he takes Saniya to explore Karachi, the city of lights without informing anyone and the two fall in love. When Shehryar asks for her phone number, she jokes that given his nature, she would give him her phone number and then she would keep waiting for his calls and he will ignore her. She, nevertheless, gives him her number. Shehryar learns from Saniya that she would be leaving in two days and was here to Pakistan to attend Natasha's wedding and to drop her father, Faisal (who is a famous writer) with his family members in his homeland just as he wished.\n\nSaniya goes back to Turkey. Farida decides to join the drama industry just to 'pass time' which frustrates Shehryar immensely and in his frustration and his friends teasing him about Saniya, he ignores several calls and texts from her. As he is about to receive her call, he is mugged and Saniya comes to believe that Shehryar has used her.\n\n'''Chapter Two: Rustom's Wedding'''\n\nFaisal writes the script for a drama titled Parey Hut Love and informs Shehryar that he would be cast as the lead. Shehryar is overjoyed but has no one to finance the production of the film. Meanwhile, Farida makes it big in the industry and becomes famous. Rustom, a distant relative of Shehryar who is a Parsi proposes to Tanaaz, his cousin. Shehryar is elated to learn that Saniya has come for the wedding but is heartbroken when Saniya makes him meet her fianc\u00e9, Hassan. She deliberately attempts to make Shehryar jealous by openly praising Hassan.\n\nThe wedding takes place. Shehryar confronts Saniya after it and tells her that his phone was stolen. Saniya refuses to believe him and tells him that it is too late and that she will not leave Hassan at any cost.\n\nShehryar goes to several producers only to be repeatedly rejected for the script of parey hut love. Shehryar's stepfather (who is nicknamed by Shehryar as 'Half Dad') finances the production. Shehryar for the first time calls him 'dad'. \n\nThe production of Parey Hut Love begins but Saniya arrives to inform Shehryar of Faisal's increasing brain tumor and gives him the card for her wedding which is to take place in Kashmir, Faisal's hometown. This leads to a major fight between Sheheryar and Arshad who is more focused on his project. Shehryar leaves for Kashmir. Arshad follows him and they reunite. Shehryar tells Saniya that his biological father did not love him at all, even though Shehryar loved him and left him and his mother. Thus, he became a commitment phobe. \n\n'''Chapter Three: Saniya's Wedding'''\n\nSaniya's wedding arrives and Sheheryar falls into depression stemmed from Saniya's rejection. \nShehryar begs her to forgive him and marry him, to leave Hassan but Saniya implies that she can't. Meanwhile, Faisal passes away. The wedding is immediately postponed and the funeral is arranged. Saniya leaves in the misery caused by Faisal's death and Shehryar's fierce love for her.\n\n'''Chapter Four: Shehryar's wedding'''\n\nA few years later, Shehryar is a successful actor and is engaged to megastar, Zeena who loves him. Shehryar also reciprocates her feelings but still loves Saniya. Saniya tells Hassan that she is in love with Shehryar and breaks her engagement with him. Hassan forgives her and they continue as friends. Saniya, having learned of Shehryar's wedding (which is to take place in Turkey) from media reports, arrives at the wedding and tells Shehryar that she left Hassan because she told him that she loved someone else. Shehryar's feelings for Saniya rekindle. Zeena realizes Shehryar loves Saniya not heer after seeing Saniya leave his room.\nAt the wedding, Zeena motivates Shehryar to go after Saniya who was leaving for another city. Shehryar goes after her. Arshad and Shabbo express their liking for each other.\nShehryar finds Saniya and tells her that he left Zeena because she found out that he loved someone else. The movie ends on a happy note with Shehryar and Saniya embracing each other.\n\n<br />\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sheheryar Munawar]] as Sheheryar\n* [[Maya Ali]] as Saniya<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/333989-|title=Maya Ali to star opposite Sheheryar Munawar in Paray Hut Love|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=30 March 2019|work=The News}}</ref>\n* [[Ahmed Ali Butt]] as Arshad\n* [[Zara Noor Abbas]] as Shabbo<ref name=\"PHL1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/30/mahira-khan-sheheryar-munawar-zara-noor-abbas-to-star-in-asim-razas-next/|title=Mahira Khan, Sheheryar Munawar, Zara Noor Abbas to star in Asim Raza's next|date=30 March 2018|website=[[Pakistan Today]]|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Nadeem Baig (actor)|Nadeem Baig]] as Faisal\n* [[Hina Dilpazeer]] as Farida\n* Shahbaz Shigri as Hasan<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/parey-hut-love-is-a-romantic-melodrama-with-gloss-and-glamour/|title=Trailer Review: Parey Hut Love is a romantic melodrama with gloss and glamour|work=Something Haute|accessdate=22 June 2019|date=22 June 2019|author=Syeda Zehra}}</ref>\n* Munawar Alam Siddiqui as Aziz\n* [[Rachel Viccaji]] as Tanaaz\n* Faheem Azam as Rustom\n* Yousuf Bashir Qureshi as Mehmood\n* Frieha Altaf as Feroza<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/frieha-altaf-parey-hut-love/|title=Frieha Altaf joins the cast of 'Parey Hut Love' for a special role|work=Something Haute|accessdate=30 March 2019|date=8 November 2018|author=Shahjehan Saleem}}</ref>\n* Parisheh James<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181504|title=Parey Hut Love's shoot concludes with a star-studded wrap-up party|author=Maliha Rehman|date=18 December 2018|work=Dawn Images|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref> as Natasha<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1997852/4|title='Paray Hut Love' trailer explores typical boy-meets-girl love story|author=Haddiqua Siddiqui|date=22 June 2019|accessdate=22 June 2019|work=Dawn Images}}</ref>\n* Jimmy Khan as Anwar\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* [[Fawad Khan]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181382|title=Fawad Khan will make a special appearance in Parey Hut Love|date=1 December 2018|accessdate=1 December 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref>\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Zeena<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/385799-|title=\"Parey Hut Love was meant to be,\" says Maya Ali|date=25 October 2018|work=The News|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Marina Khan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181617|title=Parey Hut Love is a lighthearted love story with lots of subliminal layers, says Asim Raza|author=Maliha Rehman|date=7 January 2019|work=Dawn Images|accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref> \n* [[Sonya Jehan]]\n* [[Imran Aslam (actor)|Imran Aslam]]\n* Cybil Chowdhry\n* [[Meera (actress)|Meera]] as Karishma Chaudhry\n* [[Saife Hassan]]\n* [[Durdana Butt]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Pre-production]] of the film began in July 2018, [[Sheheryar Munawar]] producing the film, wanted to cast [[Mahira Khan]] but due to date issues she couldn't take the role., [[Maya Ali]] was later cast in the same role.

According to the Army Commander [[Mahesh Senanayake]],  Bathiudeen called him three times first to confirm if a person was arrested and after ignoring him twice the commander confirmed that the person was arrested. Bathiudeen then mentioned the suspect's father and asked what can be done to which the army commander replied asking him to call back in one and a half years as he has the authority to detain him that long. Further a house belonging to his sister was rented out to the terrorists to which Bathiudeen stated that his sister was in Canada.
