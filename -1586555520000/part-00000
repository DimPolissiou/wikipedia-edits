The municipality has a population of approximately 778,843 as of 2012. On its own, it would be the 8th largest city in Turkey.\n\nThe district has been shaped by several civilizations: [[Roman Empire|Rome]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The first marks of the Ottoman Empire exist within Osmangazi where it extended from the foot of [[Uluda\u011f]] to the plain of Bursa. Within the boundaries of Osmangazi, approximately 1800 registered historical buildings exist.\n\n==History==\nIt was stated that there were various settlements in Bursa and its surroundings by 4000 B.C. But the certain information related to the region belongs to 700 B.C. [[Homer]] called the region [[Mysia]]. There are two villages that are ancient Mysia settlements: Misi (G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015ftepe) and Misebolu. The region is called [[Phrygia]] in historical geography. It is known that [[Cimmerians]], fleeing from the migration of the [[Scythians]], put an end to Phrygian sovereignty. The name of Bursa comes from the founder of this city, Prussias, the King of [[Bithynia]]. The Bithynians, who migrated to the region in 7th century B.C., used the name Bithynia.\n\nIt was pointed out that one of the most important commanders that [[Carthage]] had recommended the establishment of the City of Prusias and Olympus to King Prusian I. in 185 B.C. By that time, \"Prusa\" has been transformed to Bursa.\n\nWhen Bithynia joined the [[Roman Empire]] in 74 B.C., it became the [[Asia (Roman province)|Asian Province]] that was governed by [[proconsuls]] (head of the province), who were appointed in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].\n\nBursa was under the sovereignty of the [[Byzantine Empire]] between 385-1326 A.D. The city became a thermal city after the [[thermal baths]] while [[silk]] production in the region started in 550 A.D. Bursa was seized by [[Osman I]] in 1307 and conquered by [[Orhan]], the son of Osman I, on 6 April 1335. The capital of the empire was moved to Bursa in 1335 and new development movements were initiated. When Bursa was conquered, the city consisted of the inner castle, but Orhan had the Orhan Gazi Complex built out of the town. Public buildings such as mosques, baths, soup houses, hospitals, [[madrasahs]] were built out of the walls, where new settlements had been created, hence a new tradition of settling area had been established. Right after the conquest of Istanbul by Sultan [[Mehmed I]]., the active role of Bursa and its qualification as the administrative center had faded away. There are no buildings surviving from the Roman and Byzantine era. It is believed that the walls surrounding the city were built by Bithynians and used by the Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans after maintenance.\n\nBursa had developed more than other cities in the first two centuries of Ottoman rule. It was filled with a number of architectural structures and became a trade city as well as a science city, where various famous madrasahs were located. H\u00fcdavendigar Complex of Sultan Murat I., Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Complex of Sultan Bayezid I., and Green Complex all began their construction under Sultan Mehmed I. and were finished by Sultan [[Murad II]]. They affected the spatial development of Bursa and still exist to this day. Industrialization within the city was accelerated in the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|republican era]], so that the population and the urban development of the city changed in the 1960s. The geographical location and the agricultural and industrial potential have increased the attraction of the city.\n\n==Geography==\n\nOsmangazi, the center of social and economic relations for years, is in the crossroad of roads to \u0130zmir, \u0130stanbul and Eski\u015fehir. Osmangazi is the biggest district of Bursa that is on the southwest coast of [[Marmara Sea]]. G\u00f6kdere River on the east, Nil\u00fcfer River and Mudanya Road on the west, Kat\u0131rl\u0131 Mountains on the north, Uluda\u011f and Kirazl\u0131 Plateau are the natural and artificial boundaries of the district.\n\n==Economy==\nNonetheless following types of industries exist in Osmangazi: [[automotive]] supply industry, [[textile]], [[towel]], knitter & tricot, shoe industry, [[agricultural machine]]s, [[furniture]], [[leather]], plastic, machine and [[metal industry]], electric, foundry, [[welding machine]], stove and knife sectors. Moreover, there are also oil and flour factories.\n\n==Main sights==\n* Re\u015fat Oyal Culture Park, which is the symbol of Bursa,\n* \u0130nkaya Plane which is the natural monument of 500 years old,\n* Tophane Slopes,\n* Kozahan, which is located between Ulu Mosque and Orhan Mosque,\n* Emirhan which was built by Orhan Bey in 1340, Muradiye Complex which is composed of madrasah, school, soup house, bath and mosque, and more than twenty tombs including [[Murat II]]. and [[Cem Sultan]],\n* [[H\u00fcdavendigar Mosque]],\n* [[Grand Mosque of Bursa]], which is the sample of multi-pillared and multi-domed mosques,\n* Merinos City Park,\n* Botanical Park,\n* So\u011fanl\u0131 Zoo,\n* P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131 Park,\n* So\u011fukkuyu Park,\n* Hamitler Park,\n* Cable Water Ski Center.\n\n==Historical monuments==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Bursa Castle\n* Bursa Fortress,\n* Tomb of Murad I.,\n* Tomb of Pars Bey,\n* \u00c7ak\u0131r A\u011fa Bath,\n* Tombs of Osmangazi and Orhangazi,\n* Tomb of \u015eehzade Mustafa, Bazaar,\n* [[Bursa Archaeological Museum|Archeology Museum]],\n* [[Bursa Atat\u00fcrk Museum|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]],\n* [[Museum of Ottoman House]],\n* City Museum,\n* \u00d6rdekli Culture Center,\n* G\u00f6kdere Madrasah,\n* [[Irgand\u0131 Bridge]],\n* Hara\u00e7\u00e7\u0131o\u011flu Madrasah,\n* Karaba\u015f-\u0131 Veli Lodge,\n* Balibey Khan,\n* Muradiye Bath,\n* Galle Khan\n}}\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 sister cities===\nOsmangazi is [[Sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Karde\u015f \u015eehirlerimiz|url=http://www.osmangazi.bel.tr/tr/osmangazi/kardes-sehirler|website=osmangazi.bel.tr|publisher=Osmangazi|language=tr|accessdate=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|CYP}} [[Agios Sergios, Cyprus|Agios Sergios]], Cyprus\n*{{flagicon|SYR}} [[Aleppo]], Syria\n*{{flagicon|GRC}} [[Arriana]], Greece\n*{{flagicon|PSE}} [[Beit Hanoun]], Palestine\n*{{flagicon|MKD}} [[\u010cair Municipality|\u010cair (Skopje)]], North Macedonia\n<!--Doboj -

This gives him a birth date somewhere between 1207 and 1209.

The marriage between Jochi and Khan-Sultan took place in 1220, allowing Berke's birth to be no earlier than 1221.<ref>{{cite book |first=Anne F. |last=Broadbridge |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |year=2018 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |pages=231\u2013232 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBerke was present, with several of his brothers, at the inauguration of his uncle [[\u00d6gedei]] as [[Great Khan]] in 1229.\n\nIn 1236, Berke joined his brothers [[Orda Khan|Orda]], Sinkur, and [[Shiban]] and an assortment of cousins under the leadership of [[Batu Khan]] in a vast army, comprising some 150,000 soldiers, which marched from [[Siberia]] and into the territory of the Muslim [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]] and [[Kipchaks]], whom they subdued. Batu and [[Subutai]] sent Berke to the country north of the [[Caucasus]] to conquer the Kipchaks there. Next they devastated the principalities of [[Ryazan]] and [[Suzdal]] in 1237, and marched further into Russia. During the winter of 1238-39, Berke defeated the Kipchaks and imprisoned the chief of the [[Merkit]]s. He afterwards subdued the steppe watered by the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma]] and the [[Terek River|Terek]] west of the Caspian Sea.\n\nBerke further served under his brother during the invasion of Europe, fighting at the [[Battle of the Mohi]], where the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] army was decimated.  When [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] died, and all the princes of the blood were summoned to return to [[Mongolia]] to select a Great Khan, Berke and his brothers joined Batu in the kurultai to elect a new Great Khan.\n\n== Conversion to Islam ==\nBerke Khan converted to  Islam in the city of Bukhara in 1252. When he was at [[Saray-J\u00fck]], Berke met a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] from [[Bukhara]] and questioned them about their faith. Berke was convinced to convert by the caravan travellers and became a Muslim. Berke then persuaded his brother Tukh-timur to convert to [[Islam]] as well.\n\nIn 1248 Batu sent Berke, along with his brother Tukh-timur, to Mongolia in order to install [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] on the throne of Great Khan. When he arrived, he invited the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatai]] and Ogedeyd families several times. That is why Berke conducted the [[kurultai]] in 1251 and had M\u00f6ngke enthroned. Berke organized everything under strict conditions.\n\n==Assuming the Golden Horde==\n[[File:Golden Horde 1389.svg|right|400px|thumb|The domains of the Golden Horde in 1389. The gold star shows the location of New [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], capital of the [[Golden Horde]].]]\n\nWhen Batu died in 1255, he was briefly succeeded by his sons [[Sartaq Khan]] and [[Ulaghchi]], before Berke assumed leadership in 1257. He was an able ruler and succeeded in maintaining and stabilizing the Golden Horde, the western khanate of the Mongol Empire. During his government, the Mongols finally defeated the rebellion of [[Danylo of Halych]] and made a [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|second attack against Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], led by general [[Burundai]] (Lublin, Zawichost, Sandomierz, Krak\u00f3w and Bytom were plundered) in 1259. Also in 1265 there was a raid against [[Bulgaria]] and Byzantine [[Thrace]]. Michael of the [[Byzantine Empire]] also sent much valuable fabric to the Golden Horde as a tribute thereafter.\n\n==Berke-Hulagu War==\n{{Main|Berke\u2013Hulagu war}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BerkeGoldenHorde.jpg|thumb|]] -->\nBerke soon became a devout Muslim. His conversion resulted in the Blue Horde becoming primarily Muslim, although there were still animists and Buddhists among them. Berke was angered by Hulagu's destruction of Baghdad and was determined to deal with [[Hulagu Khan]], who had murdered the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]], and whose territorial ambitions in Syria and Egypt threatened Berke's fellow Muslims.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ilkhanates led by [[Kitbuqa]] had fallen out with the crusaders holding the coast of Palestine, and the [[Mamluks]] had secured a pact of neutrality with them, passing through their territory, and destroying the Ilkhanate army at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Kitbuqa was killed. [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]] were regained, the border remaining the [[Tigris]] for the duration of Hulagu's dynasty.  Berke's vow of vengeance against Hulagu had to wait until the latter's return to his lands after the death of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]].\n \nHulagu returned to his lands by 1262, but instead of being able to avenge his defeats, was drawn into civil war with Berke and the Blue Horde. Berke Khan had promised such a defeat in his rage after Hulagu's sack of Baghdad.\n\nMuslim historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] quoted Berke Khan as telling his Mongols and Muslim subjects, in protest at the attack on Baghdad:\n\n:'''\"He (Hulagu) has sacked all the cities of the [[Muslim]]s, and has brought about the death of the [[Caliph]]. With the help of [[Allah|God]] I will call him to account for so much innocent blood.\"''' (see ''The Mongol Warlords'', quoting Rashid al-Din's record of Berke Khan's pronouncement; this quote is also found in ''The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War'')\n\nBefore his succession, he also complained to Batu \"We helped M\u00f6ngke to enthrone. But he forgot who the enemy is or friend is. Now, he is starving the lands of our friend Caliph. It is abject\". It is notable that Berke Khan kept his promise, allying himself with the Mamluks, (Berke sought an alliance with the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] against Hulagu) and when Hulagu returned to his lands in 1262, after the succession was finally settled with Kublai as the last Great Khan, and massed his armies to avenge Ain Jalut and attack the Mamluks, Berke Khan initiated a series of raids in force which drew Hulagu north to meet him. This was the first open conflict between Mongols, and signalled the end of the unified empire.\n\nBut the reasons for the conflict between Berke and Hulagu was not only just religion, but territory as well. M\u00f6ngke Khan gave lands in current day [[Azerbaijan]], which had been given to Jochi by [[Genghis Khan]], to his brother Hulagu. Although Berke did not like the situation, he was patient till M\u00f6ngke's death.\n\nBerke at first desisted from fighting Hulagu out of Mongol brotherhood, he said ''Mongols are killed by Mongol swords. If we were united, then we would have conquered all of the world.'' but the economic situation of the Golden Horde due to the actions of the Ilkhanate led him to declare jihad because of the Ilkhanids domination of the wealth of North Iran, and the Ilkhanate's demands for the Golden Horde to not sell slaves to the Mamluks.<ref name=\"Elverskog2011\">{{cite book|author=Johan Elverskog|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=6 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0531-6|pages=186\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1262 the conflict turned into open war. Hulagu Khan suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. Hulagu's forces were crushed at the [[Terek River|Terek]] river by Berke's nephew Nogai, forcing Hulagu into retreat; he died in 1265. Also Chagatai Khan [[Alghu]] invaded Khwarizm and annexed Golden Horde lands. Jochid army unsuccessfully tried to halt his advance.\n\nBerke also supported Great Khan claimant [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] in the [[Toluid Civil War]], and he minted coins in the name of Ariq B\u00f6ke. However Kublai defeated Ariq B\u00f6ke by 1264. Kublai called both Hulagu and Berke to discuss Ariq B\u00f6ke. However, both of them noted that they could not come to the Kurultai at the moment, and the new Kurultai was never held.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs Berke sought to cross the Kura river to attack Hulagu's son, [[Abaqa Khan]], he fell ill and died sometime between 1266 and 1267.<ref>E.J.

{"title_page": "Director of Public Prosecutions", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Inline|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe '''Director of Public Prosecutions''' ('''DPP''') is the office or official charged with the prosecution of [[Crime|criminal offences]] in several [[criminal jurisdiction]]s around the world. The title is used mainly in jurisdictions that are or have been members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n==Australia==\n{{Main|Director of Public Prosecutions (Australia)}}\n{{See also|Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales)}}\nAustralia has a '''Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions''', which was set up by the ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983'' and started operations in 1984. The eight [[States and territories of Australia]] also have their own DPPs.\n\nEach state and territory has its own DPP. The Office of DPP operates independently of Government. Ultimate authority for authorising prosecutions lies with the [[Attorney General]]. However, since that is a political post, and it is desired to have a non-political (public service) post carry out this function in most circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the AG are normally delegated to the DPP.\n\nIt is common for those who hold the office of Commonwealth or State DPP later to be appointed to a high judicial office. Examples include [[Mark Weinberg (judge)|Mark Weinberg]], now a justice of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Victoria; [[Michael Rozenes]], Chief Judge of the County Court of Victoria from 2002 to 2015; [[Brian Ross Martin|Brian Martin]], now Chief Justice of the Northern Territory; [[John McKechnie]], now a justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia; and [[Paul Coghlan (judge)|Paul Coghlan]], now a justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria.\n\n==Belize==\n{{main|Director of Public Prosecutions (Belize)}}\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions of [[Belize]] is the official responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences. He or she heads the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\n==Canada==\nIn Canada, each province's [[Crown Attorney Office (Canada)|Crown Attorney Office]] is responsible for the conduct of criminal prosecutions. In [[Ontario]], the local [[Crown Attorney's Office (Ontario)|Crown Attorney's Office]] in the Criminal Law Division is in charge of criminal cases. Only [[British Columbia]], Nova Scotia, and [[Quebec]] (a civil code jurisdiction) have a Director of Public Prosecutions office ''per se''.\n\nRecent{{when|date=March 2019}} legislation passed by Parliament split the conduct of federal prosecutions from the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] and created the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (officially called the [[Public Prosecution Service of Canada]]). The Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) is a federal government organisation, created on 12 December 2006, when the ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act'', Part 3 of the ''Federal Accountability Act'', came into force.\n\nThe PPSC fulfills the responsibilities of the [[Attorney General of Canada]] in the discharge of the Attorney General's criminal law mandate by prosecuting criminal offences under federal jurisdiction and by contributing to strengthening the criminal justice system.\n\nIn this regard, the PPSC assumes the role played within the Department of Justice by the former Federal Prosecution Service (FPS). The PPSC takes on additional responsibilities for prosecuting new fraud offences under the ''Financial Administration Act'', as well as offences under the ''Canada Elections Act''. Unlike the FPS, which was part of the Department of Justice, the PPSC is an independent organisation, reporting to Parliament through the Attorney General of Canada.\n\nThe PPSC is responsible for prosecuting offences under more than 50 federal statutes and for providing prosecution-related legal advice to law enforcement agencies. Cases prosecuted by the PPSC include those involving drugs, organised crime, terrorism, tax law, money laundering and proceeds of crime, crimes against humanity and war crimes, Criminal Code offences in the territories, and a large number of federal regulatory offences.\n\nThe creation of the PPSC reflects the decision to make transparent the principle of prosecutorial independence, free from any improper influence. The mandate of the PPSC is set out in the ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act''. The Act calls on the PPSC to provide prosecutorial advice to law enforcement agencies, and to act as prosecutor in matters prosecuted by the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the Crown. In addition, the mandate includes initiating and conducting prosecutions on behalf of the Crown with respect to offences under the ''Canada Elections Act''.\n\nThe PPSC reports to Parliament through the Attorney General of Canada. The ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act'' states that the Director of Public Prosecutions acts \"under and on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada.\" The relationship between the Attorney General and the Director is premised on the principles of respect for the independence of the prosecution function and the need to consult on important matters of general interest.\n\nSafeguarding the Director's independence is the requirement that all instructions from the Attorney General be in writing and published in the Canada Gazette. In turn, the Director must inform the Attorney General of any prosecution or planned intervention that may raise important questions of general interest, allowing the Attorney General the opportunity to intervene in, or assume conduct of, a case. Additionally, the PPSC must provide the Attorney General with an annual report for tabling in Parliament.\n\nThe first Director of the PPSC was Brian J. Saunders. The current Director of the PPSC is Kathleen Roussel.\n\n==Hong Kong==\nThe '''[[Director of Public Prosecutions (Hong Kong)|Director of Public Prosecutions]]''' ({{zh|\u5211\u4e8b\u6aa2\u63a7\u5c08\u54e1}}) of Hong Kong heads the [[Prosecutions Division (Hong Kong)|Prosecutions Division]] of the [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]], which is responsible for prosecuting trials and appeals on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, providing legal advice to law enforcement agencies on investigations, acting on behalf of the [[Secretary for Justice]] in the institution of criminal proceedings, and providing advice to bureaux and departments on measures to reform the criminal law. \n\nThe DPP is superintended by the Secretary for Justice, a political appointee, who is also accountable for the decisions of the DPP. The position title was until the handover of Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997 '''Crown Prosecutor'''. The Secretary for Justice and the Department of Justice were, until 1997, named the Attorney General and the [[Legal Department]], respectively.\n\n==Ireland==\nThe '''Director of Public Prosecutions''' has been responsible for prosecution of all indictable criminal offences in Ireland since the enactment of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974. Before 1974 all crimes and offences were prosecuted at the suit of (after action taken by) the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]]. The DPP may also issue a certificate that a case should be referred to the [[Special Criminal Court]], a juryless trial court usually reserved for terrorists and organised criminals.\n\nThe current Director is Claire Loftus. [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], who had served as DPP for 12 years, announced in July 2011 that he would be taking early retirement and stepped down in November 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/dpp-quits-to-protect-pension-2819909.html |title=DPP quits to protect pension |work=The Irish Independent |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nList of DPPs since 1974:<ref>Source: Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions</ref>\n*1974\u20131999 [[Eamonn Barnes]]\n*1999\u20132011 [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]]\n*2011\u2013present [[Claire Loftus]] (First woman Director of Public Prosecutions)\n\n==Mauritius==\nThe current DPP is Satyajit Boolell S.C, who has occupied the post since 2009. \n\n==Norway==\nIn [[Norway]] the Director of Public Prosecutions (''Riksadvokaten'') is the head of the [[Norwegian Prosecuting Authority]]. The director has the coordinative leadership as well as the highest authority to prosecute criminal offences. The Director is directly involved only in certain cases, such as crimes for which the maximum penalty is 21 years in prison. The director is subordinate to the [[Cabinet of Norway|Government Cabinet]], however, the cabinet has never reversed a decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions. [[Tor-Aksel Busch]] is the current Director and has been in that position since 1997.\n\n==South Africa==\nIn South Africa public prosecutions are conducted by the '''National Director of Public Prosecutions''' (NDPP), the head of the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] (NPA). The NDPP is supported by a chief executive officer, deputies, regional DPPs, and several Special Directors.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)}}\nIn [[England and Wales]], the office of '''Director of Public Prosecutions''' was first created in 1880 as part of the [[Home Office]], and had its own department from 1908. The DPP was responsible for the prosecution of only a small number of major cases until 1986 when responsibility for prosecutions was transferred to a new [[Crown Prosecution Service]] with the DPP as its head.

The title is used mainly in jurisdictions that are or have been members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n==Australia==\n{{Main|Director of Public Prosecutions (Australia)}}\n{{See also|Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales)}}\nAustralia has a '''Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions''', which was set up by the ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983'' and started operations in 1984. The eight [[States and territories of Australia]] also have their own DPPs.\n\nEach state and territory has its own DPP. The Office of DPP operates independently of Government. Ultimate authority for authorising prosecutions lies with the [[Attorney General]]. However, since that is a political post, and it is desired to have a non-political (public service) post carry out this function in most circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the AG are normally delegated to the DPP.\n\nIt is common for those who hold the office of Commonwealth or State DPP later to be appointed to a high judicial office. Examples include [[Mark Weinberg (judge)|Mark Weinberg]], now a justice of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Victoria; [[Michael Rozenes]], Chief Judge of the County Court of Victoria from 2002 to 2015; [[Brian Ross Martin|Brian Martin]], now Chief Justice of the Northern Territory; [[John McKechnie]], now a justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia; and [[Paul Coghlan (judge)|Paul Coghlan]], now a justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria.\n\n==Belize==\n{{main|Director of Public Prosecutions (Belize)}}\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions of [[Belize]] is the official responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences. He or she heads the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\n==Canada==\nIn Canada, each province's [[Crown Attorney Office (Canada)|Crown Attorney Office]] is responsible for the conduct of criminal prosecutions. In [[Ontario]], the local [[Crown Attorney's Office (Ontario)|Crown Attorney's Office]] in the Criminal Law Division is in charge of criminal cases. Only [[British Columbia]], Nova Scotia, and [[Quebec]] (a civil code jurisdiction) have a Director of Public Prosecutions office ''per se''.\n\nRecent{{when|date=March 2019}} legislation passed by Parliament split the conduct of federal prosecutions from the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] and created the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (officially called the [[Public Prosecution Service of Canada]]). The Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) is a federal government organisation, created on 12 December 2006, when the ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act'', Part 3 of the ''Federal Accountability Act'', came into force.\n\nThe PPSC fulfills the responsibilities of the [[Attorney General of Canada]] in the discharge of the Attorney General's criminal law mandate by prosecuting criminal offences under federal jurisdiction and by contributing to strengthening the criminal justice system.\n\nIn this regard, the PPSC assumes the role played within the Department of Justice by the former Federal Prosecution Service (FPS). The PPSC takes on additional responsibilities for prosecuting new fraud offences under the ''Financial Administration Act'', as well as offences under the ''Canada Elections Act''. Unlike the FPS, which was part of the Department of Justice, the PPSC is an independent organisation, reporting to Parliament through the Attorney General of Canada.\n\nThe PPSC is responsible for prosecuting offences under more than 50 federal statutes and for providing prosecution-related legal advice to law enforcement agencies. Cases prosecuted by the PPSC include those involving drugs, organised crime, terrorism, tax law, money laundering and proceeds of crime, crimes against humanity and war crimes, Criminal Code offences in the territories, and a large number of federal regulatory offences.\n\nThe creation of the PPSC reflects the decision to make transparent the principle of prosecutorial independence, free from any improper influence. The mandate of the PPSC is set out in the ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act''. The Act calls on the PPSC to provide prosecutorial advice to law enforcement agencies, and to act as prosecutor in matters prosecuted by the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the Crown. In addition, the mandate includes initiating and conducting prosecutions on behalf of the Crown with respect to offences under the ''Canada Elections Act''.\n\nThe PPSC reports to Parliament through the Attorney General of Canada. The ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act'' states that the Director of Public Prosecutions acts \"under and on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada.\" The relationship between the Attorney General and the Director is premised on the principles of respect for the independence of the prosecution function and the need to consult on important matters of general interest.\n\nSafeguarding the Director's independence is the requirement that all instructions from the Attorney General be in writing and published in the Canada Gazette. In turn, the Director must inform the Attorney General of any prosecution or planned intervention that may raise important questions of general interest, allowing the Attorney General the opportunity to intervene in, or assume conduct of, a case. Additionally, the PPSC must provide the Attorney General with an annual report for tabling in Parliament.\n\nThe first Director of the PPSC was Brian J. Saunders. The current Director of the PPSC is Kathleen Roussel.\n\n==Hong Kong==\nThe '''[[Director of Public Prosecutions (Hong Kong)|Director of Public Prosecutions]]''' ({{zh|\u5211\u4e8b\u6aa2\u63a7\u5c08\u54e1}}) of Hong Kong heads the [[Prosecutions Division (Hong Kong)|Prosecutions Division]] of the [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]], which is responsible for prosecuting trials and appeals on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, providing legal advice to law enforcement agencies on investigations, acting on behalf of the [[Secretary for Justice]] in the institution of criminal proceedings, and providing advice to bureaux and departments on measures to reform the criminal law. \n\nThe DPP is superintended by the Secretary for Justice, a political appointee, who is also accountable for the decisions of the DPP. The position title was until the handover of Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997 '''Crown Prosecutor'''. The Secretary for Justice and the Department of Justice were, until 1997, named the Attorney General and the [[Legal Department]], respectively.\n\n==Ireland==\nThe '''Director of Public Prosecutions''' has been responsible for prosecution of all indictable criminal offences in Ireland since the enactment of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974. Before 1974 all crimes and offences were prosecuted at the suit of (after action taken by) the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]]. The DPP may also issue a certificate that a case should be referred to the [[Special Criminal Court]], a juryless trial court usually reserved for terrorists and organised criminals.\n\nThe current Director is Claire Loftus. [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], who had served as DPP for 12 years, announced in July 2011 that he would be taking early retirement and stepped down in November 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/dpp-quits-to-protect-pension-2819909.html |title=DPP quits to protect pension |work=The Irish Independent |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nList of DPPs since 1974:<ref>Source: Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions</ref>\n*1974\u20131999 [[Eamonn Barnes]]\n*1999\u20132011 [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]]\n*2011\u2013present [[Claire Loftus]] (First Woman Director of Public Prosecutions)\n\n==Mauritius==\nThe current DPP is Satyajit Boolell S.C, who has occupied the post since 2009. \n\n==Norway==\nIn [[Norway]] the Director of Public Prosecutions (''Riksadvokaten'') is the head of the [[Norwegian Prosecuting Authority]]. The director has the coordinative leadership as well as the highest authority to prosecute criminal offences. The Director is directly involved only in certain cases, such as crimes for which the maximum penalty is 21 years in prison. The director is subordinate to the [[Cabinet of Norway|Government Cabinet]], however, the cabinet has never reversed a decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions. [[Tor-Aksel Busch]] is the current Director and has been in that position since 1997.\n\n==South Africa==\nIn South Africa public prosecutions are conducted by the '''National Director of Public Prosecutions''' (NDPP), the head of the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] (NPA). The NDPP is supported by a chief executive officer, deputies, regional DPPs, and several Special Directors.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)}}\nIn [[England and Wales]], the office of '''Director of Public Prosecutions''' was first created in 1880 as part of the [[Home Office]], and had its own department from 1908. The DPP was responsible for the prosecution of only a small number of major cases until 1986 when responsibility for prosecutions was transferred to a new [[Crown Prosecution Service]] with the DPP as its head. The Director is appointed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]].\n\nThe current DPP, since 1 November 2018, is [[Max Hill]] QC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/max-hill-director-cps-public-prosecutions-terror-watchdog-job-history-a8461416.html|title=Terror watchdog Max Hill QC appointed as new Director of Public Prosecutions|work=The Independent|access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Scotland===\nUnder [[Scots law]] the [[public prosecutor]] is the [[Lord Advocate]] who heads up the [[Crown Office]] and Procurator Fiscal Service.

Words that are synonyms are said to be '''synonymous''', and the state of being a synonym is called '''synonymy'''.  For example, the words ''begin'', ''start'', ''commence'', and ''initiate'' are all synonyms of one another. Words are typically synonymous in one particular [[word sense|sense]]: for example, ''long'' and ''extended'' in the [[context (language use)|context]] ''long time'' or ''extended time'' are synonymous, but ''long'' cannot be used in the phrase ''extended family''. Synonyms with exactly the same meaning share a [[seme (semantics)|seme]] or denotational [[sememe]], whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or [[connotation]]al sememe and thus overlap within a [[semantic field]].

WW Norton & Company, 1997.</ref>\n\n==Lexicography==\nSome [[Rapper]]s claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because [[etymology]], [[orthography]], phonic qualities, [[connotation]]s, ambiguous meanings, [[usage (language)|usage]], and so on make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: ''feline'' is more formal than ''cat''; ''long'' and ''extended'' are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a ''long arm'' is not the same as an ''extended arm''). Synonyms are also a source of [[euphemism]]s.\n\n[[Metonymy]] can sometimes be a form of synonymy: ''the [[White House]]'' is used as a synonym of ''the administration'' in referring to the U.S. [[executive (government)|executive branch]] under a specific president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-architecture.com/A-AMERICA-N/USA/USA-Washington/DC-001.htm|title=World Architecture Images- The White House|website=www.essential-architecture.com|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Thus a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word ''metonym'' is a [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponym]] of the word ''synonym''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe analysis of synonymy, [[polysemy]], hyponymy, and [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernymy]] is inherent to [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the [[information science|information-science]] senses of those terms.<ref>Hirst, Graeme. \"[ftp://ftp.db.toronto.edu/public_html/dist/gh/Hirst-Ontol-2009-as-published.pdf Ontology and the lexicon].\" Handbook on ontologies.

Such like, ''he expired'' means the same as ''he died'', yet ''my passport has expired'' cannot be replaced by ''my passport has died''.\n\nIn English, many synonyms emerged in the [[Middle Ages]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]]. While England's new ruling class spoke [[Norman French]], the lower classes continued to speak [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon). As Old English became more developed, more words would be borrowed from a variety of languages, resulting in more synonyms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3qs0AQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=origin+on+english+synonym&ots=dgutkQZOqK&sig=wPqhozO_CsN6CkjZ0eH2lDz51Eo#v=onepage&q=synonym&f=false|title=The Making of English|last=Bradley|first=Henry|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan and Company, Limited|language=en}}</ref> Thus, today we have synonyms like the Norman-derived ''people'', ''liberty'' and ''archer'', and the Saxon-derived ''folk'', ''freedom'' and ''bowman''. For more examples, see the [[list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English]].\n\nA [[thesaurus]] lists similar or related words; these are often, but not always, synonyms.\n\n* The word '''''poecilonym''''' is a rare synonym of the word ''synonym''. It is not entered in most major dictionaries and is a curiosity or piece of trivia for being an [[autological word]] because of its [[meta]] quality as a synonym of ''synonym''.\n* '''[[Antonym]]s''' are words with opposite or nearly opposite meanings. For example: ''hot'' \u2194 ''cold'', ''large'' \u2194 ''small'', ''thick'' \u2194 ''thin'', ''synonym'' \u2194 ''antonym'' \n* [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|'''Hypernyms''' and '''hyponyms''']] are words that refer to, respectively, a general category and a specific instance of that category. For example, ''vehicle'' is a hypernym of ''car'', and ''car'' is a hyponym of ''vehicle''.\n* '''[[Homophone]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation, but different meanings. For example, ''witch'' and ''which'' are homophones in most accents (because they are pronounced the same).\n* '''[[Homograph]]s''' are words that have the same spelling, but have different pronunciations. For example, one can ''record'' a song or keep a ''record'' of documents.\n* '''[[Homonym]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation and spelling, but have different meanings.

The former are sometimes called [[cognitive synonymy|cognitive synonyms]] and the latter, near-synonyms,<ref name=\"Stanojevi\u0107_2009\">{{Citation |last=Stanojevi\u0107 |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193\u2013200 | url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}</ref> plesionyms<ref>DiMarco, Chrysanne, and Graeme Hirst. \"Usage notes as the basis for a representation of near-synonymy for lexical choice.\" Proceedings of 9th annual conference of the University of Waterloo Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary and Text Research. 1993.</ref> or poecilonyms.<ref>Grambs, David. The Endangered English Dictionary: Bodacious Words Your Dictionary Forgot. WW Norton & Company, 1997.</ref>\n\n==Lexicography==\nSome [[lexicographer]]s claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because [[etymology]], [[orthography]], phonic qualities, [[connotation]]s, ambiguous meanings, [[usage (language)|usage]], and so on make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: ''feline'' is more formal than ''cat''; ''long'' and ''extended'' are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a ''long arm'' is not the same as an ''extended arm''). Synonyms are also a source of [[euphemism]]s.\n\n[[Metonymy]] can sometimes be a form of synonymy: ''the [[White House]]'' is used as a synonym of ''the administration'' in referring to the U.S. [[executive (government)|executive branch]] under a specific president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-architecture.com/A-AMERICA-N/USA/USA-Washington/DC-001.htm|title=World Architecture Images- The White House|website=www.essential-architecture.com|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Thus a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word ''metonym'' is a [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponym]] of the word ''synonym''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe analysis of synonymy, [[polysemy]], hyponymy, and [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernymy]] is inherent to [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the [[information science|information-science]] senses of those terms.<ref>Hirst, Graeme. \"[ftp://ftp.db.toronto.edu/public_html/dist/gh/Hirst-Ontol-2009-as-published.pdf Ontology and the lexicon].\" Handbook on ontologies. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2009. 269-292.</ref> It has applications in [[pedagogy]] and [[machine learning]], because they rely on [[word-sense disambiguation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Peter D.|date=2008|title=A Uniform Approach to Analogies, Synonyms, Antonyms, and Associations|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1599081.1599195|journal=Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1|series=COLING '08|location=Stroudsburg, PA, USA|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|pages=905\u2013912|isbn=978-1-905593-44-6}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''s\u00fdn'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd]]}}; \"with\") and ''\u00f3noma'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1]]}}; \"name\").\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Synonym.png|English language]]\n\nSynonyms can be any [[part of speech]], as long as both words belong to the same part of speech. Examples:\n\n*noun\n**''drink'' and ''beverage''\n*verb\n**''buy'' and ''purchase''\n*adjective\n**''big'' and ''large''\n*adverb\n**''quickly'' and ''speedily''\n*preposition\n** ''on'' and ''upon''\n\nSynonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words: ''pupil'' as the ''aperture in the iris of the eye'' is not synonymous with ''student''. Such like, ''he expired'' means the same as ''he died'', yet ''my passport has expired'' cannot be replaced by ''my passport has died''.\n\nIn English, many synonyms emerged in the [[Middle Ages]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]]. While England's new ruling class spoke [[Norman French]], the lower classes continued to speak [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon). As Old English became more developed, more words would be borrowed from a variety of languages, resulting in more synonyms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3qs0AQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=origin+on+english+synonym&ots=dgutkQZOqK&sig=wPqhozO_CsN6CkjZ0eH2lDz51Eo#v=onepage&q=synonym&f=false|title=The Making of English|last=Bradley|first=Henry|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan and Company, Limited|language=en}}</ref> Thus, today we have synonyms like the Norman-derived ''people'', ''liberty'' and ''archer'', and the Saxon-derived ''folk'', ''freedom'' and ''bowman''. For more examples, see the [[list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English]].\n\nA [[thesaurus]] lists similar or related words; these are often, but not always, synonyms.\n\n* The word '''''poecilonym''''' is a rare synonym of the word ''synonym''. It is not entered in most major dictionaries and is a curiosity or piece of trivia for being an [[autological word]] because of its [[meta]] quality as a synonym of ''synonym''.\n* '''[[Antonym]]s''' are words with opposite or nearly opposite meanings. For example: ''hot'' \u2194 ''cold'', ''large'' \u2194 ''small'', ''thick'' \u2194 ''thin'', ''synonym'' \u2194 ''antonym'' \n* [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|'''Hypernyms''' and '''hyponyms''']] are words that refer to, respectively, a general category and a specific instance of that category. For example, ''vehicle'' is a hypernym of ''car'', and ''car'' is a hyponym of ''vehicle''.\n* '''[[Homophone]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation, but different meanings. For example, ''witch'' and ''which'' are homophones in most accents (because they are pronounced the same).\n* '''[[Homograph]]s''' are words that have the same spelling, but have different pronunciations. For example, one can ''record'' a song or keep a ''record'' of documents.\n* '''[[Homonym]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation and spelling, but have different meanings. For example, ''rose'' (a type of flower) and ''rose'' (past tense of ''rise'') are homonyms.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[-onym]]\n* [[Cognitive synonymy]]\n* [[Elegant variation]], the gratuitous use of a synonym in prose\n* [[Synonym ring]]\n* [[Synonymy in Japanese]]\n* {{Annotated link|Thesaurus|Thesauri and synonym dictionaries}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\nTools which graph words relations:\n* [https://graphwords.com/ GraphWords] \u2013 Online tool for visualization word relations\n* [http://www.synonyms.net/ Synonyms.net] \u2013 Online reference resource that provides instant synonyms and antonyms definitions including visualizations, voice pronunciations and translations\n* [http://www.atlas-semantiques.eu/?l=EN English/French Semantic Atlas] \u2013 Graph words relations in English, French and gives cross representations for translations \u2013 offers 500 searches per user per day.\n\nPlain words synonyms finder:\n* [https://www.synonym-finder.com/ Synonym Finder] \u2013 Synonym finder including hypernyms in search result\n* [http://trovami.altervista.org/sinonimi/en Thesaurus] \u2013 Online synonyms in English, Italian, French and German\n* [http://synonyms.woxikon.com/ Woxikon Synonyms] \u2013 Over 1 million synonyms \u2013 English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish and Dutch\n* [http://www.findmewords.com/synonyms.html FindMeWords Synonyms] \u2013 Online Synonym Dictionary with definitions\n* [http://www.classicthesaurus.com Classic Thesaurus] \u2013 Crowdsourced synonym dictionary\n* [https://www.powerthesaurus.org/ Power Thesaurus] \u2013 Synonym dictionary with definitions and examples and other references\n* [https://pasttenses.com/ Past Tenses Synonyms] \u2013 Online synonym finding website\n\n{{Lexicology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lexical semantics]]\n[[Category:Types of words]]\n", "name_user": "71.218.60.111", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLexicography)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"}

(The {{IPA|/s/}} found in modern Tongan derives from *t before high front vowels). Most Polynesian languages have lost the original proto-Polynesian glottal stop {{IPA|/q/}}; however, it has been retained in Tongan and a few other languages including Rapa Nui.<ref>The glottal stop in most other Polynesian languages are the reflexes of other consonants of proto-Polynesian; for example, the glottal stop of Samoan and Hawaiian is a reflex of the original *k; the glottal stop of Cook Islands M\u0101ori represents a merger of the original *f and *s. Tongan does not show changes such as the *t to {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|*\u014b}} to {{IPA|/n/}} of Hawaiian; nor has Tongan shifted *f to {{IPA|/h/}}. Although Tongan, Samoan and other Western Polynesian languages are not affected by a change in [[Central Eastern Polynesian languages]] (such as [[M\u0101ori language|New Zealand M\u0101ori]]) involving the dissimilation of {{IPA|/faf/}} to {{IPA|/wah/}}, Tongan has vowel changes (as seen in ''monumanu'' from original ''manumanu'') which are not a feature of other languages.</ref>\n# In proto-Polynesian, *r and *l were distinct phonemes, but in most Polynesian languages they have merged, represented orthographically as ''r'' in most East Polynesian languages, and as ''l'' in most West Polynesian languages. However, the distinction can be reconstructed because Tongan kept the *l but lost the *r.<ref>This loss may be quite recent. The word \"lua\", meaning \"two\", is still found in some placenames and archaic texts. \"Marama\" (light) thus became \"maama\", and the two successive \"a\"s are still pronounced separately, not yet contracted to \"m\u0101ma\". On the other hand \"toro\" (sugarcane) already has become \"t\u014d\" (still \"tolo\" in S\u0101moan).</ref>\n\nTongan has heavily influenced the [[Wallisian language]] after Tongans colonized the island of [[Wallis (island)|'Uvea]] in the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|language=German|author=Akihisa Tsukamoto|title=Forschungen \u00fcber die Sprachen der Inseln zwischen Tonga und Saamoa|editor=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|year=1994|pages=109|isbn=3825820157|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZQVriuXhE8AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n! colspan=\"10\" |Polynesian sound correspondences\n|-\n!Phoneme\n|[[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]]\n|Tongan\n|[[Niuean language|Niuean]]\n|[[Samoan language|S\u0101moan]]\n|[[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]]\n|[[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]\n|[[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]]\n|[[Cook Islands Maori|Cook Is.

In the old, \"missionary\" [[alphabet]], the order of the letters was modified: the [[vowels]] were put first and then followed by the [[consonants]]: a, e, i, o, u, etc. That was still so as of the [[Privy Council]] decision of 1943 on the orthography of the Tongan language. However, C. M. Churchward's grammar and dictionary favoured the standard European alphabetical order, which, since his time, has been in use exclusively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Tongan alphabet\n! Letter\n| '''a'''\n| '''e'''\n| '''f'''\n| '''h'''\n| '''i'''\n| '''k'''\n| '''l'''\n| '''m'''\n| '''n'''\n| '''ng'''\n| '''o'''\n| '''p'''\n| '''s'''\n| '''t'''\n| '''u'''\n| '''v'''\n| '''{{okina}}''' (''fakau{{okina}}a'')\n|-\n!

It should be written with the modifier letter turned comma ([[Unicode]] 0x02BB) and not with the [[Quotation mark|single quote]] open or with a mixture of quotes open and quotes close. See also [[\u02bbOkina|{{okina}}okina]].\n\nNote that the above order is strictly followed in proper dictionaries. Therefore, ''ngatu'' follows ''nusi'', ''{{okina}}a'' follows ''vunga'' and it also follows ''z'' if foreign words occur. Words with [[Vowel length|long vowels]] come directly after those with short vowels. Improper wordlists may or may not follow these rules. (For example, the Tonga [[telephone directory]] for years now ignores all rules.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}})\n\nThe original ''j'', used for {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, disappeared in the beginning of the 20th century, merging with {{IPA|/s/}}. By 1943, ''j'' was no longer used. Consequently, many words written with ''s'' in Tongan are cognate to those with ''t'' in other Polynesian languages. For example, ''Masisi'' (a star name) in Tongan is cognate with ''Matiti'' in [[Tokelau language|Tokelauan]]; ''siale'' ([[Gardenia]] taitensis) in Tongan and ''tiare'' in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]. This seems to be a natural development, as {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} in many Polynesian languages derived from Proto-Polynesian {{IPA|/ti/}}.\n\n== Syllabification ==\n\n*Each syllable has exactly one vowel. The number of syllables in a word is exactly equal to the number of vowels it has.\n*Long vowels, indicated with a ''toloi'' ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]), count as one, but may in some circumstances be split up in two short ones, in which case, they are both written. Toloi are supposed to be written where needed, in practice this may be seldom done.\n*Each syllable may have no more than one consonant.\n*Consonant combinations are not permitted. The ''[[Ng (character)|ng]]'' is not a consonant combination, since it represents a single sound. As such it can never be split, the proper [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] of {{lang|to|fakatonga}} (Tongan) therefore is fa-ka-to-nga.\n*Each syllable must end in a vowel. All vowels are pronounced, but an ''i'' at the end of an utterance is usually unvoiced.\n*The ''fakau{{okina}}a'' is a consonant. It must be followed (and, except at the beginning of a word, preceded) by a vowel. Unlike the glottal stops in many other Polynesian languages texts, the fakau{{okina}}a is always written. (Only sometimes before 1943.)\n*Stress normally falls on the next to last syllable of a word with two or more syllables; example: {{lang|to|m\u00f3he}} (sleep), {{lang|to|moh\u00e9nga}} (bed). If, however, the last vowel is long, it takes the stress; example: {{lang|to|kum\u0101}} (mouse) (stress on the long \u0101). The stress also shifts to the last vowel if the next word is an [[clitic|enclitic]]; example: {{lang|to|f\u00e1le}} (house), {{lang|to|fal\u00e9 ni}} (this house). Finally the stress can shift to the last syllable, including an enclitic, in case of the definitive accent; example: {{lang|to|moheng\u00e1}} ((that) particular bed), {{lang|to|fale n\u00ed}} (this particular house). It is also here that a long vowel can be split into two short ones; example: p\u014d (night), po\u00f3 ni (this night), p\u014d n\u00ed (this particular night). Or the opposite: {{lang|to|ma\u00e1ma}} (light), {{lang|to|m\u0101m\u00e1 ni}} (this light), {{lang|to|maama n\u00ed}} (this particular light). Of course, there are some exceptions to the above general rules. The stress [[Acute accent|accent]] is normally not written, except where it is to indicate the definitive accent or ''fakamamafa''. But here, too, people often neglect to write it, only using it when the proper stress cannot be easily derived from the context.\n\nAlthough the acute accent has been available on most [[personal computer]]s from their early days onwards, when Tongan newspapers started to use computers around 1990 to produce their papers, they were unable to find, or failed to enter, the proper keystrokes, and it grew into a habit to put the accent after the vowel instead of on it: not ''{{lang|to|\u00e1}}'' but ''{{lang|to|a\u00b4}}''. But as this distance seemed to be too big, a demand arose for Tongan fonts where the acute accent was shifted to the right, a position halfway in between the two extremes above. Most papers still follow this practice.\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n===Articles===\nEnglish, like most European languages, uses only two [[Article (grammar)|article]]s:\n* indefinite ''a''\n* definite ''the''\n\nBy contrast, Tongan has three articles, and [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]] also have a three-level definiteness distinction:\n* indefinite ''ha''. Example: ko ha p\u0101langi ('a white person', or any other person from somewhere other than Tonga)\n* semi-definite ''(h)e''. Example: ko e p\u0101langi ('the white person' in the sense that the person does not belong to some other race, but still rather 'a white person' if there are several of them)\n* definite ''(h)e'' with the shifted ultimate stress. Example: ko e p\u0101lang\u00ed ('the white person', that particular person there and no one else).\n\n===Registers===\nThere are three [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] which consist of\n* ordinary words (the normal language)\n* honorific words (the language for the chiefs)\n* regal words (the language for the king)\nThere are also further distinctions between \n* polite words (used for more formal contexts)\n* derogatory words (used for informal contexts, or to indicate humility)\nFor example, the phrase \"Come and eat!\" translates to:\n* ordinary: ''ha{{okina}}u {{okina}}o kai'' (come and eat!); Friends, family members and so forth may say this to each other when invited for dinner.\n* honorific: ''me{{okina}}a mai pea {{okina}}ilo'' (come and eat!); The proper used towards chiefs, particularly the nobles, but it may also be used by an employee towards his boss, or in other similar situations. When talking about chiefs, however, it is always used, even if they are not actually present, but in other situations only on formal occasions. A complication to the beginning student of Tongan is that such words very often also have an alternative meaning in the ordinary register: ''me{{okina}}a'' (thing) and ''{{okina}}ilo'' (know, find).\n* regal: ''h\u0101{{okina}}ele mai pea taumafa'' (come and eat!); Used towards the king or God. The same considerations as for the honorific register apply. ''H\u0101{{okina}}ele'' is one of the regal words which have become the normal word in other Polynesian languages.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe Tongan language distinguishes three [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. They appear as the three major columns in the tables below.\n\nThe Tongan language distinguishes four persons: First person [[Clusivity|exclusive]], first person [[Clusivity|inclusive]], second person and third person. They appear as the four major rows in the tables below.  This gives us 12 main groups.\n\n====Subjective and objective====\n\nIn addition, possessive pronouns are either [[alienable possession|alienable]] (reddish) or [[inalienable possession|inalienable]] (greenish), which Churchward termed ''subjective'' and ''objective''. This marks a distinction that has been referred to, in some analyses of other [[Polynesian languages]], as ''a-possession'' versus ''o-possession'', respectively,<ref>These ''a'' and ''o'' refer to the characteristic vowel used in those pronouns. In Tongan, however, this distinction is much less clear, and rather a characteristic for the indefinite and definite forms respectively. Use of the ''a'' & ''o'' terms therefore is not favoured.</ref> though more Tongan-appropriate version would be ''{{okina}}e-possession'' and ''ho-possession''.\n\n''Subjective'' and ''objective'' are fitting labels when dealing with verbs: ''{{okina}}eku taki'' \"my leading\" vs. ''hoku taki'' \"my being led\".  However, this is less apt when used on nouns.  Indeed, in most contexts ''hoku taki'' would be interpreted as \"my leader\", as a noun rather than a verb.  What then of nouns that have no real verb interpretation, such as ''fale'' \"house\"?\n\nChurchward himself laid out the distinction thus:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Churchward\n | first = C.M.\n | title = Tongan Grammar\n | publisher = Vava'u Press Limited\n | date = 1999\n | pages = 81\n | isbn = 982-213-007-4}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>But what about those innumerable cases in which the possessive can hardly be said to correspond either to the subject or to the object of a verb?  What, for example, is the rule or the guiding principle, which lies behind the fact that a Tongan says ''{{okina}}eku pa{{okina}}anga'' for ' my money' but ''hoku fale'' for 'my house'?\n\nIt may be stated as follows: the use of ''{{okina}}eku'' for 'my' implies that I am active, influential, or formative, &c., towards the thing mentioned, whereas the use of ''hoku'' for 'my' implies that the thing mentioned is active, influential, or formative, &c., towards me.  Or, provided that we give a sufficiently wide meaning to the word 'impress', we may say, perhaps, that ''{{okina}}eku'' is used in reference to things upon which I impress myself, while ''hoku'' is used in reference to things which impress themselves upon me.</blockquote>\n\n{{okina}}E possessives are generally used for:\n\n*Goods, money, tools, utensils, instruments, weapons, vehicles, and other possessions which the subject owns or uses (''{{okina}}eku pa{{okina}}anga'', \"my money\")\n*Animals or birds which the subjects owns or uses (''{{okina}}eku fanga puaka'', \"my pigs\")\n*Things which the subject eats, drinks, or smokes (''{{okina}}eku me{{okina}}akai'', \"my food\")\n*Things which the subject originates, makes, mends, carries, or otherwise deals with (''{{okina}}eku kavenga'', \"my burden\")\n*Persons in the subject's employ, under their control, or in their care (''{{okina}}eku tamaio{{okina}}eiki'' \"my male servant\")\n\nHo possessives are generally used for\n\n*Things which are a part of the subject or 'unalienable' from the subject, such as body parts (''hoku sino'', \"my body\")\n*Persons or things which represent the subject (''hoku hingoa'', \"my name\")\n*The subject's relatives, friends, associates, or enemies (''hoku hoa'', \"my companion (spouse)\")\n*Things which are provided for the subject or devolve to them or fall to their lot (''hoku tofi{{okina}}a'', \"my inheritance\")\n*In general, persons or things which surround, support, or control the subject, or on which the subject depends (''hoku kolo'', \"my village/town\")\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions which do not fall under the guidelines above, for instance, ''{{okina}}eku tamai'', \"my father\".  The number of exceptions is large enough to make the alienable and inalienable distinction appear on the surface to be as arbitrary as the [[grammatical gender]] distinction for Romance languages, but by and large the above guidelines hold true.\n\n=====Cardinal pronouns=====\nThe cardinal pronouns are the main [[personal pronoun]]s which in Tongan can either be preposed (before the [[verb]], light colour) or postposed (after the verb, dark colour). The first are the normal alienable possessive pronouns, the latter the stressed alienable pronouns, which are sometimes uses as [[reflexive pronoun]]s, or with ''kia te'' in front the inalienable possessive forms. (There is no possession involved in the cardinal pronouns and therefore no alienable or inalienable forms).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Cardinal pronouns\n|-\n!colspan=2|\n!Position\n!Singular\n!Dual\n!Plural\n|- align=center\n!rowspan=4|1st person \n!rowspan=2|<small>exclusive <br>(I, we, us)</small>\n|preposed\n|u, ou, ku\n|ma\n|mau\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|au\n|kimaua\n|kimautolu\n|- align=center\n!rowspan=2|<small>inclusive<br>(one, we, us)</small>\n|preposed\n|te\n|ta\n|tau\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|kita\n|kitaua\n|kitautolu\n|- align=center\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|2nd person\n|preposed\n|ke\n|mo\n|mou\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|koe\n|kimoua\n|kimoutolu\n|- align=center\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|3rd person\n|preposed\n|ne\n|na\n|nau\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|ia\n|kinaua\n|kinautolu\n|}\n\nRemember:\n*all the preposed pronouns of one syllable only (ku, u, ma, te, ta, ke, mo, ne, na) are enclitics which never can take the stress, but put it on the vowel in front of them. Example: ''\u02bboku na\u00fa'' versus ''\u02bbok\u00fa na'' (not: ''\u02bboku n\u00e1'').\n*first person singular, ''I'' uses ''u'' after ''kuo'', ''te'', ''ne'', and also ''ka'' (becomes ''kau''), ''pea'', ''mo'' and ''\u02bbo''; but uses ''ou'' after ''\u02bboku''; and uses ''ku'' after ''na\u02bba''.\n*first person inclusive (I and you) is of course somewhat a misnomer, at least in the singular. The meanings of ''te'' and ''kita'' can often rendered as ''one'', that is the modesty ''I''.\nExamples of use.\n*Na\u02bba ''ku'' fehu\u02bbi: I asked\n*Na\u02bbe fehu\u02bbi (\u02bbe) ''au'': I(!) asked (stressed)\n*\u02bbOku ''ou'' fehu\u02bbi ''au'': I ask myself\n*Te ''u'' fehu\u02bbi kiate ''koe'': I shall ask you\n*Te ''ke'' tali kiate ''au'': You will answer me\n*Kapau te ''te'' fehu\u02bbi: If one would ask\n*''Tau'' \u014d ki he hulohula?: Are we (all) going to the ball?\n*Sinitalela, ''mau'' \u014d ki he hulohula: [[Cinderella]], we go to the ball (... said the evil stepmother, and she went with two of her daughters, but not Cinderella)\n\nAnother archaic aspect of Tongan is the retention of preposed pronouns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} They are used much less frequently in S\u0101moan and have completely disappeared in East Polynesian languages, where the pronouns are cognate with the Tongan postposed form minus ''ki-''. (We love you: \u02bbOku \u02bbofa kimautolu kia te kimoutolu; M\u0101ori: e aroha nei m\u0101tou i a koutou).\n\n=====Possessive pronouns=====\nThe [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]] for every person and number (1st person plural, 3rd person dual, etc.) can be further divided into normal or ordinary (light colour), emotional (medium colour) and emphatic (bright colour) forms. The latter is rarely used, but the two former are common and further subdivided in [[Definite pronoun|definite]] (saturated colour) and [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] (greyish colour) forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:#ffd;\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:large\" | Possessive<br/>pronouns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | definite<br/>or not\n| rowspan=\"2\" | type\n| colspan=\"2\" | singular\n| colspan=\"2\" | dual\n| colspan=\"2\" | plural\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fea;\"| alienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#efa;\"| inalienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#fea;\"| alienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#efa;\"| inalienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#fea;\"| alienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#efa;\"| inalienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n|-\n!

The meanings of ''he\u02bbete, hoto'', etc. can often rendered as ''one's'', that is the modesty ''me''.\n#the choice between an alienable or inalienable possessive is determined by the word or phrase it refers to. For example: ''ko ho fale'' '(it is) your house' (inalienable), ''ko ho'o tohi'', '(it is) your book' (alienable). *''Ko ho tohi, ko ho\u02bbo fale''* are wrong. Some words can take either, but with a difference in meaning: ''ko \u02bbene taki'' 'his/her leadership'; ''ko hono taki'' 'his/her leader'.\n\nExamples of use.\n*ko ha\u02bbaku/haku kahoa: my garland (any garland from or for me)\n*ko \u02bbeku/hoku kahoa: my garland (it is my garland)\n*ko \u02bbeku/hoku kaho\u00e1: my garland, that particular one and no other\n*ko he\u02bbete/hoto kahoa: one's

cherished garland)\n*ko ha\u02bbak\u00fa/ho\u02bbok\u00fa kahoa: garland (emphatically mine) &ndash; that particular garland is mine and not someone else's\n*ko homa kahoa: our garlands (exclusive: you and I are wearing them, but not the person we are talking to)\n*ko hota kahoa: our garlands (inclusive: you and I are wearing them, and I am talking to you)\n\n=====Other pronouns=====\nThese are

It has around 187,000 speakers<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ton|title=Tongan|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> and is a [[national language]] of [[Tonga]]. It is a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object|VSO]] (verb\u2013subject\u2013object) language.\n\n==Related languages==\nTongan is one of the multiple languages in the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] branch of the Austronesian languages, along with [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Maori language|Maori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], for example. Together with [[Niuean language|Niuean]], it forms the [[Tongic languages|Tongic]] subgroup of Polynesian.\n\nTongan is unusual among Polynesian languages in that it has a so-called ''definitive accent''. As with all Polynesian languages, Tongan has adapted the phonological system of proto-Polynesian.\n\n# Tongan has retained the original proto-Polynesian *h, but has merged it with the original *s as {{IPA|/h/}}. (The {{IPA|/s/}} found in modern Tongan derives from *t before high front vowels). Most Polynesian languages have lost the original proto-Polynesian glottal stop {{IPA|/q/}}; however, it has been retained in Tongan and a few other languages including Rapa Nui.<ref>The glottal stop in most other Polynesian languages are the reflexes of other consonants of proto-Polynesian; for example, the glottal stop of Samoan and Hawaiian is a reflex of the original *k; the glottal stop of Cook Islands M\u0101ori represents a merger of the original *f and *s. Tongan does not show changes such as the *t to {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|*\u014b}} to {{IPA|/n/}} of Hawaiian; nor has Tongan shifted *f to {{IPA|/h/}}. Although Tongan, Samoan and other Western Polynesian languages are not affected by a change in [[Central Eastern Polynesian languages]] (such as [[M\u0101ori language|New Zealand M\u0101ori]]) involving the dissimilation of {{IPA|/faf/}} to {{IPA|/wah/}}, Tongan has vowel changes (as seen in ''monumanu'' from original ''manumanu'') which are not a feature of other languages.</ref>\n# In proto-Polynesian, *r and *l were distinct phonemes, but in most Polynesian languages they have merged, represented orthographically as ''r'' in most East Polynesian languages, and as ''l'' in most West Polynesian languages. However, the distinction can be reconstructed because Tongan kept the *l but lost the *r.<ref>This loss may be quite recent. The word \"lua\", meaning \"two\", is still found in some placenames and archaic texts. \"Marama\" (light) thus became \"maama\", and the two successive \"a\"s are still pronounced separately, not yet contracted to \"m\u0101ma\". On the other hand \"toro\" (sugarcane) already has become \"t\u014d\" (still \"tolo\" in S\u0101moan).</ref>\n\nTongan has heavily influenced the [[Wallisian language]] after Tongans colonized the island of [[Wallis (island)|'Uvea]] in the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|language=German|author=Akihisa Tsukamoto|title=Forschungen \u00fcber die Sprachen der Inseln zwischen Tonga und Saamoa|editor=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|year=1994|pages=109|isbn=3825820157|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZQVriuXhE8AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n! colspan=\"10\" |Polynesian sound correspondences\n|-\n!Phoneme\n|[[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]]\n|Tongan\n|[[Niuean language|Niuean]]\n|[[Samoan language|S\u0101moan]]\n|[[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]]\n|[[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]\n|[[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]]\n|[[Cook Islands Maori|Cook Is.

In the old, \"missionary\" [[alphabet]], the order of the letters was modified: the [[vowels]] were put first and then followed by the [[consonants]]: a, e, i, o, u, etc. That was still so as of the [[Privy Council]] decision of 1943 on the orthography of the Tongan language. However, C. M. Churchward's grammar and dictionary favoured the standard European alphabetical order, which, since his time, has been in use exclusively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Tongan alphabet\n! Letter\n| '''a'''\n| '''e'''\n| '''f'''\n| '''h'''\n| '''i'''\n| '''k'''\n| '''l'''\n| '''m'''\n| '''n'''\n| '''ng'''\n| '''o'''\n| '''p'''\n| '''s'''\n| '''t'''\n| '''u'''\n| '''v'''\n| '''{{okina}}''' (''fakau{{okina}}a'')\n|-\n!

It should be written with the modifier letter turned comma ([[Unicode]] 0x02BB) and not with the [[Quotation mark|single quote]] open or with a mixture of quotes open and quotes close. See also [[\u02bbOkina|{{okina}}okina]].\n\nNote that the above order is strictly followed in proper dictionaries. Therefore, ''ngatu'' follows ''nusi'', ''{{okina}}a'' follows ''vunga'' and it also follows ''z'' if foreign words occur. Words with [[Vowel length|long vowels]] come directly after those with short vowels. Improper wordlists may or may not follow these rules. (For example, the Tonga [[telephone directory]] for years now ignores all rules.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}})\n\nThe original '''j''', used for {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, disappeared in the beginning of the 20th century, merging with {{IPA|/s/}}. By 1943, '''j''' was no longer used. Consequently, many words written with '''s''' in Tongan are cognate to those with '''t''' in other Polynesian languages. For example, ''Masisi'' (a star name) in Tongan is cognate with ''Matiti'' in [[Tokelau language|Tokelauan]]; ''siale'' ([[Gardenia]] taitensis) in Tongan and ''tiare'' in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]. This seems to be a natural development, as {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} in many Polynesian languages derived from Proto-Polynesian {{IPA|/ti/}}.\n\n== Syllabification ==\n\n*Each syllable has exactly one vowel. The number of syllables in a word is exactly equal to the number of vowels it has.\n*Long vowels, indicated with a '''toloi''' ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]), count as one, but may in some circumstances be split up in two short ones, in which case, they are both written. Toloi are supposed to be written where needed, in practice this may be seldom done.\n*Each syllable may have no more than one consonant.\n*Consonant combinations are not permitted. The '''[[Ng (character)|ng]]''' is not a consonant combination, since it represents a single sound. As such it can never be split, the proper [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] of {{lang|to|fakatonga}} (Tongan) therefore is fa-ka-to-nga.\n*Each syllable must end in a vowel. All vowels are pronounced, but an '''i''' at the end of an utterance is usually unvoiced.\n*The '''fakau{{okina}}a''' is a consonant. It must be followed (and, except at the beginning of a word, preceded) by a vowel. Unlike the glottal stops in many other Polynesian languages texts, the fakau{{okina}}a is always written. (Only sometimes before 1943.)\n*Stress normally falls on the next to last syllable of a word with two or more syllables; example: {{lang|to|m\u00f3he}} (sleep), {{lang|to|moh\u00e9nga}} (bed). If, however, the last vowel is long, it takes the stress; example: {{lang|to|kum\u0101}} (mouse) (stress on the long \u0101). The stress also shifts to the last vowel if the next word is an [[clitic|enclitic]]; example: {{lang|to|f\u00e1le}} (house), {{lang|to|fal\u00e9 ni}} (this house). Finally the stress can shift to the last syllable, including an enclitic, in case of the definitive accent; example: {{lang|to|moheng\u00e1}} ((that) particular bed), {{lang|to|fale n\u00ed}} (this particular house). It is also here that a long vowel can be split into two short ones; example: p\u014d (night), po\u00f3 ni (this night), p\u014d n\u00ed (this particular night). Or the opposite: {{lang|to|ma\u00e1ma}} (light), {{lang|to|m\u0101m\u00e1 ni}} (this light), {{lang|to|maama n\u00ed}} (this particular light). Of course, there are some exceptions to the above general rules. The stress [[Acute accent|accent]] is normally not written, except where it is to indicate the definitive accent or '''fakamamafa'''. But here, too, people often neglect to write it, only using it when the proper stress cannot be easily derived from the context.\n\nAlthough the acute accent has been available on most [[personal computer]]s from their early days onwards, when Tongan newspapers started to use computers around 1990 to produce their papers, they were unable to find, or failed to enter, the proper keystrokes, and it grew into a habit to put the accent after the vowel instead of on it: not '''{{lang|to|\u00e1}}''' but '''{{lang|to|a\u00b4}}'''. But as this distance seemed to be too big, a demand arose for Tongan fonts where the acute accent was shifted to the right, a position halfway in between the two extremes above. Most papers still follow this practice.\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n===Articles===\nEnglish, like most European languages, uses only two [[Article (grammar)|article]]s:\n* indefinite '''a'''\n* definite '''the'''\n\nBy contrast, Tongan has three articles, and [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]] also have a three-level definiteness distinction:\n* indefinite '''ha'''. Example: ko ha p\u0101langi ('a white person', or any other person from somewhere other than Tonga)\n* semi-definite '''(h)e'''. Example: ko e p\u0101langi ('the white person' in the sense that the person does not belong to some other race, but still rather 'a white person' if there are several of them)\n* definite '''(h)e''' with the shifted ultimate stress. Example: ko e p\u0101lang\u00ed ('the white person', that particular person there and no one else).\n\n===Registers===\nThere are three [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] which consist of\n* ordinary words (the normal language)\n* honorific words (the language for the chiefs)\n* regal words (the language for the king)\nThere are also further distinctions between \n* polite words (used for more formal contexts)\n* derogatory words (used for informal contexts, or to indicate humility)\nFor example, the phrase \"Come and eat!\" translates to:\n* ordinary: ''ha{{okina}}u {{okina}}o kai'' (come and eat!); Friends, family members and so forth may say this to each other when invited for dinner.\n* honorific: ''me{{okina}}a mai pea {{okina}}ilo'' (come and eat!); The proper used towards chiefs, particularly the nobles, but it may also be used by an employee towards his boss, or in other similar situations. When talking about chiefs, however, it is always used, even if they are not actually present, but in other situations only on formal occasions. A complication to the beginning student of Tongan is that such words very often also have an alternative meaning in the ordinary register: ''me{{okina}}a'' (thing) and ''{{okina}}ilo'' (know, find).\n* regal: ''h\u0101{{okina}}ele mai pea taumafa'' (come and eat!); Used towards the king or God. The same considerations as for the honorific register apply. ''H\u0101{{okina}}ele'' is one of the regal words which have become the normal word in other Polynesian languages.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe Tongan language distinguishes three [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. They appear as the three major columns in the tables below.\n\nThe Tongan language distinguishes four persons: First person [[Clusivity|exclusive]], first person [[Clusivity|inclusive]], second person and third person. They appear as the four major rows in the tables below.  This gives us 12 main groups.\n\n====Subjective and objective====\n\nIn addition, possessive pronouns are either [[alienable possession|alienable]] (reddish) or [[inalienable possession|inalienable]] (greenish), which Churchward termed ''subjective'' and ''objective''. This marks a distinction that has been referred to, in some analyses of other [[Polynesian languages]], as ''a-possession'' versus ''o-possession'', respectively,<ref>These ''a'' and ''o'' refer to the characteristic vowel used in those pronouns. In Tongan, however, this distinction is much less clear, and rather a characteristic for the indefinite and definite forms respectively. Use of the ''a'' & ''o'' terms therefore is not favoured.</ref> though more Tongan-appropriate version would be ''{{okina}}e-possession'' and ''ho-possession''.\n\n''Subjective'' and ''objective'' are fitting labels when dealing with verbs: ''{{okina}}eku taki'' \"my leading\" vs. ''hoku taki'' \"my being led\".  However, this is less apt when used on nouns.  Indeed, in most contexts ''hoku taki'' would be interpreted as \"my leader\", as a noun rather than a verb.  What then of nouns that have no real verb interpretation, such as ''fale'' \"house\"?\n\nChurchward himself laid out the distinction thus:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Churchward\n | first = C.M.\n | title = Tongan Grammar\n | publisher = Vava'u Press Limited\n | date = 1999\n | pages = 81\n | isbn = 982-213-007-4}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>But what about those innumerable cases in which the possessive can hardly be said to correspond either to the subject or to the object of a verb?  What, for example, is the rule or the guiding principle, which lies behind the fact that a Tongan says ''{{okina}}eku pa{{okina}}anga'' for ' my money' but ''hoku fale'' for 'my house'?\n\nIt may be stated as follows: the use of ''{{okina}}eku'' for 'my' implies that I am active, influential, or formative, &c., towards the thing mentioned, whereas the use of ''hoku'' for 'my' implies that the thing mentioned is active, influential, or formative, &c., towards me.  Or, provided that we give a sufficiently wide meaning to the word 'impress', we may say, perhaps, that ''{{okina}}eku'' is used in reference to things upon which I impress myself, while ''hoku'' is used in reference to things which impress themselves upon me.</blockquote>\n\n{{okina}}E possessives are generally used for:\n\n*Goods, money, tools, utensils, instruments, weapons, vehicles, and other possessions which the subject owns or uses (''{{okina}}eku pa{{okina}}anga'', \"my money\")\n*Animals or birds which the subjects owns or uses (''{{okina}}eku fanga puaka'', \"my pigs\")\n*Things which the subject eats, drinks, or smokes (''{{okina}}eku me{{okina}}akai'', \"my food\")\n*Things which the subject originates, makes, mends, carries, or otherwise deals with (''{{okina}}eku kavenga'', \"my burden\")\n*Persons in the subject's employ, under their control, or in their care (''{{okina}}eku tamaio{{okina}}eiki'' \"my male servant\")\n\nHo possessives are generally used for\n\n*Things which are a part of the subject or 'unalienable' from the subject, such as body parts (''hoku sino'', \"my body\")\n*Persons or things which represent the subject (''hoku hingoa'', \"my name\")\n*The subject's relatives, friends, associates, or enemies (''hoku hoa'', \"my companion (spouse)\")\n*Things which are provided for the subject or devolve to them or fall to their lot (''hoku tofi{{okina}}a'', \"my inheritance\")\n*In general, persons or things which surround, support, or control the subject, or on which the subject depends (''hoku kolo'', \"my village/town\")\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions which do not fall under the guidelines above, for instance, ''{{okina}}eku tamai'', \"my father\".  The number of exceptions is large enough to make the alienable and inalienable distinction appear on the surface to be as arbitrary as the [[grammatical gender]] distinction for Romance languages, but by and large the above guidelines hold true.\n\n=====Cardinal pronouns=====\nThe cardinal pronouns are the main [[personal pronoun]]s which in Tongan can either be preposed (before the [[verb]], light colour) or postposed (after the verb, dark colour). The first are the normal alienable possessive pronouns, the latter the stressed alienable pronouns, which are sometimes uses as [[reflexive pronoun]]s, or with ''kia te'' in front the inalienable possessive forms. (There is no possession involved in the cardinal pronouns and therefore no alienable or inalienable forms).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Cardinal pronouns\n|-\n!colspan=2|\n!Position\n!Singular\n!Dual\n!Plural\n|- align=center\n!rowspan=4|1st person \n!rowspan=2|<small>exclusive <br>(I, we, us)</small>\n|preposed\n|u, ou, ku\n|ma\n|mau\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|au\n|kimaua\n|kimautolu\n|- align=center\n!rowspan=2|<small>inclusive<br>(one, we, us)</small>\n|preposed\n|te\n|ta\n|tau\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|kita\n|kitaua\n|kitautolu\n|- align=center\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|2nd person\n|preposed\n|ke\n|mo\n|mou\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|koe\n|kimoua\n|kimoutolu\n|- align=center\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|3rd person\n|preposed\n|ne\n|na\n|nau\n|- align=center\n|postposed\n|ia\n|kinaua\n|kinautolu\n|}\n\nRemember:\n*all the preposed pronouns of one syllable only (ku, u, ma, te, ta, ke, mo, ne, na) are enclitics which never can take the stress, but put it on the vowel in front of them. Example: ''\u02bboku na\u00fa'' versus ''\u02bbok\u00fa na'' (not: ''\u02bboku n\u00e1'').\n*first person singular, ''I'' uses '''u''' after ''kuo'', ''te'', ''ne'', and also ''ka'' (becomes ''kau''), ''pea'', ''mo'' and ''\u02bbo''; but uses '''ou''' after ''\u02bboku''; and uses '''ku''' after ''na\u02bba''.\n*first person inclusive (I and you) is of course somewhat a misnomer, at least in the singular. The meanings of ''te'' and ''kita'' can often rendered as ''one'', that is the modesty ''I''.\nExamples of use.\n*Na\u02bba '''ku''' fehu\u02bbi: I asked\n*Na\u02bbe fehu\u02bbi (\u02bbe) '''au''': I(!) asked (stressed)\n*\u02bbOku '''ou''' fehu\u02bbi '''au''': I ask myself\n*Te '''u''' fehu\u02bbi kiate '''koe''': I shall ask you\n*Te '''ke''' tali kiate '''au''': You will answer me\n*Kapau te '''te''' fehu\u02bbi: If one would ask\n*'''Tau''' \u014d ki he hulohula?: Are we (all) going to the ball?\n*Sinitalela, '''mau''' \u014d ki he hulohula: [[Cinderella]], we go to the ball (... said the evil stepmother, and she went with two of her daughters, but not Cinderella)\n\nAnother archaic aspect of Tongan is the retention of preposed pronouns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} They are used much less frequently in S\u0101moan and have completely disappeared in East Polynesian languages, where the pronouns are cognate with the Tongan postposed form minus ''ki-''. (We love you: \u02bbOku \u02bbofa kimautolu kia te kimoutolu; M\u0101ori: e aroha nei m\u0101tou i a koutou).\n\n=====Possessive pronouns=====\nThe [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]] for every person and number (1st person plural, 3rd person dual, etc.) can be further divided into normal or ordinary (light colour), emotional (medium colour) and emphatic (bright colour) forms. The latter is rarely used, but the two former are common and further subdivided in [[Definite pronoun|definite]] (saturated colour) and [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] (greyish colour) forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:#ffd;\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:large\" | Possessive<br/>pronouns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | definite<br/>or not\n| rowspan=\"2\" | type\n| colspan=\"2\" | singular\n| colspan=\"2\" | dual\n| colspan=\"2\" | plural\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fea;\"| alienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#efa;\"| inalienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#fea;\"| alienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#efa;\"| inalienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#fea;\"| alienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n| style=\"background:#efa;\"| inalienable<sup>2,5</sup>\n|-\n!
