His father's background helped his career: the elder Bertolucci had helped the Italian filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] publish his first novel, and Pasolini reciprocated by hiring Bertolucci as first assistant in Rome on ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961).\n\nBertolucci had one brother, the theatre director and playwright [[Giuseppe Bertolucci|Giuseppe]] (27 February 1947 \u2013 16 June 2012). His cousin was the film producer Giovanni Bertolucci (24 June 1940 \u2013 17 February 2005), with whom he worked on a number of films.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Directorial breakthrough ===\nBertolucci initially wished to become a poet like his father. With this goal in mind, he attended the Faculty of Modern Literature of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] from 1958 to 1961, where his film career as an assistant director to Pasolini began.<ref>{{cite web|title=A YOUNG BERTOLUCCI TALKS ABOUT PASOLINI (from \"Pasolini l'Enrag\u00e9\")|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR0D8nuI1iE|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=August 25, 2012|author=theblackpaul|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Shortly after, Bertolucci left the University without graduating. In 1962, at the age of 22, he directed his first feature film, produced by Tonino Cervi with a screenplay by Pasolini, called ''[[La commare secca]]'' (1962). The film is a murder mystery, following a prostitute's homicide. Bertolucci uses flashbacks to piece together the crime and the person who committed it. The film which shortly followed was his acclaimed ''[[Before the Revolution]]'' (''Prima della rivoluzione'', 1964).\n\nThe boom of [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], which gave Bertolucci his start, slowed in the 1970s as directors were forced to co-produce their films with several of the American, Swedish, French, and German companies and actors due to the effects of the global economic recession on the Italian film industry.\n\nBertolucci caused controversy in 1972 with the film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] and [[Massimo Girotti]]. The film presents Brando's character, Paul, as he copes with his wife's suicide by emotionally and physically dominating a young woman, Jeane (Schneider). The depictions of Schneider, then 19 years old, were regarded as exploitative. In one scene, Paul anally rapes Jeane using butter as a lubricant. The use of butter was not in the script; Bertolucci and Brando had discussed it, but they did not tell Schneider. She said in 2007 that she had cried \"real tears\" during the scene and had felt humiliated and \"a little raped\".<ref name=Izadi5Dec2016>Izadi, Elahe (5 December 2016).

He was a professed [[Marxist]] and, like [[Luchino Visconti]], who similarly employed many foreign artists during the late 1960s, Bertolucci used his films to express his political views; hence they are often autobiographical as well as highly controversial. His political films were preceded by others re-evaluating history. ''[[The Conformist (1970 film)|The Conformist]]'' (1970) criticised [[Fascist]] ideology, touched upon the relationship between nationhood and nationalism, as well as issues of popular taste and collective memory, all amid an international plot by [[Benito Mussolini]] to assassinate a politically active [[left-wing politics|leftist]] professor of philosophy in Paris. ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' also analyses the struggle of Left and Right.\n\nOn 27 September 2009, Bertolucci was one of the signatories of the appeal to the Swiss government to release [[Roman Polanski]], who was being held awaiting extradition to the United States.<ref name=\"Alt\">{{cite web|author=Andre Soares|date=September 30, 2009|title=Penelope Cruz, Bernardo Bertolucci, Gael Garcia Bernal Sign Polanski Petition|publisher=Alt Film Guide|accessdate=August 31, 2013|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/politics/penelope-cruz-bertolucci-bernal-polanski-petition}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Twitter]] on 24 April 2015, Bertolucci participated in #whomademyclothes, Fashion Revolution's anti-[[sweatshop]] campaign commemorating the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion Revolution: who made your clothes?|url=http://www.mindfood.com/article/fashion-revolution-who-made-your-clothes/}}</ref>\n\nBertolucci advocated the practice of Transcendental Meditation: \"We want to evoke the present and it is difficult to do it all together, we can only meditate , as in transcendental meditation.

His father's background helped his career: the elder Bertolucci had helped the Italian filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] publish his first novel, and Pasolini reciprocated by hiring Bertolucci as first assistant in Rome on ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961).\n\nBertolucci had one brother, the theatre director and playwright [[Giuseppe Bertolucci|Giuseppe]] (27 February 1947 \u2013 16 June 2012). His cousin was the film producer Giovanni Bertolucci (24 June 1940 \u2013 17 February 2005), with whom he worked on a number of films.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Directorial breakthrough ===\nBertolucci initially wished to become a poet like his father. With this goal in mind, he attended the Faculty of Modern Literature of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] from 1958 to 1961, where his film career as an assistant director to Pasolini began.<ref>{{cite web|title=A YOUNG BERTOLUCCI TALKS ABOUT PASOLINI (from \"Pasolini l'Enrag\u00e9\")|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR0D8nuI1iE|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=August 25, 2012|author=theblackpaul|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Shortly after, Bertolucci left the University without graduating. In 1962, at the age of 22, he directed his first feature film, produced by Tonino Cervi with a screenplay by Pasolini, called ''[[La commare secca]]'' (1962). The film is a murder mystery, following a prostitute's homicide. Bertolucci uses flashbacks to piece together the crime and the person who committed it. The film which shortly followed was his acclaimed ''[[Before the Revolution]]'' (''Prima della rivoluzione'', 1964).\n\nThe boom of [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], which gave Bertolucci his start, slowed in the 1970s as directors were forced to co-produce their films with several of the American, Swedish, French, and German companies and actors due to the effects of the global economic recession on the Italian film industry.\n\nBertolucci caused controversy in 1972 with the film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] and [[Massimo Girotti]]. The film presents Brando's character, Paul, as he copes with his wife's suicide by emotionally and physically dominating a young woman, Jeane (Schneider). The depictions of Schneider, then 19 years old, were regarded as exploitative. In one scene, Paul anally rapes Jeane using butter as a lubricant. The use of butter was not in the script; Bertolucci and Brando had discussed it, but they did not tell Schneider.

He was a professed [[Marxist]] and, like [[Luchino Visconti]], who similarly employed many foreign artists during the late 1960s, Bertolucci used his films to express his political views; hence they are often autobiographical as well as highly controversial. His political films were preceded by others re-evaluating history. ''[[The Conformist (1970 film)|The Conformist]]'' (1970) criticised [[Fascist]] ideology, touched upon the relationship between nationhood and nationalism, as well as issues of popular taste and collective memory, all amid an international plot by [[Benito Mussolini]] to assassinate a politically active [[left-wing politics|leftist]] professor of philosophy in Paris. ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' also analyses the struggle of Left and Right.\n\nOn 27 September 2009, Bertolucci was one of the signatories of the appeal to the Swiss government to release [[Roman Polanski]], who was being held awaiting extradition to the United States.<ref name=\"Alt\">{{cite web|author=Andre Soares|date=September 30, 2009|title=Penelope Cruz, Bernardo Bertolucci, Gael Garcia Bernal Sign Polanski Petition|publisher=Alt Film Guide|accessdate=August 31, 2013|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/politics/penelope-cruz-bertolucci-bernal-polanski-petition}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Twitter]] on 24 April 2015, Bertolucci participated in #whomademyclothes, Fashion Revolution's anti-[[sweatshop]] campaign commemorating the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion Revolution: who made your clothes?|url=http://www.mindfood.com/article/fashion-revolution-who-made-your-clothes/}}</ref>\n\nBertolucci advocated the practice of Transcendental Meditation: \"We want to evoke the present and it is difficult to do it all together, we can only meditate , as in transcendental meditation.
