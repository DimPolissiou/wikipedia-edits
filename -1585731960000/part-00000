The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions a marketplace named ''Poduke'' (ch 60). [[G. W. B. Huntingford]] suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of [[Arikamedu]] (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century\" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BC to the eighth century AD.<ref>\n{{cite web | title=The Dating of Arikamedu and its Bearing on the Archaeology of Early Historical South India | author=Vimala Begley | url=http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | access-date=1 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100834/http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | archive-date=1 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|date=July 2007|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-548-20943-1|page=119|access-date=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517054619/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondich\u00e9ry) became a French colony of the [[French colonial empire]]. Together with [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]] (already French since 1673), [[Mah\u00e9, Puducherry|Mah\u00e9]] (since 1721), [[Yanam]] ([[Yanaon]]) (since 1731), [[Karaikal]] (Karikal) (since 1739) and [[Masulipatam]] (1760), it formed the French colony of [[French India]], under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] occupations. The territories of [[French India]] were completely transferred to the Republic of India de facto on 1 November 1954, and de jure on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian constituent union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves (with the exception of [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]], which merged with the state of [[West Bengal]] in 1954).\n\n==Geography==\n{{further|List of rivers of Puducherry}}\nThe Union Territory of Puducherry consists of [[List of districts of Puducherry|four small unconnected districts]]: [[Puducherry district]] ({{cvt|293|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}), [[Karaikal district]] ({{cvt|161|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) and [[Yanam district]] ({{cvt|20|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Mah\u00e9 district]] ({{cvt|9|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Laccadive Sea]], covering a total area of {{cvt|483|sqkm|sqmi}}. Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both [[enclaves]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Yanam and Mah\u00e9 are enclaves of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]], respectively. Its population, as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]], is 1,244,464.\n\nSome of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called \"pockets\" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mah\u00e9 region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] with Puducherry retaining the borders of former [[French India]].\n\nAll four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in [[Puducherry district]], seven in [[Karaikal district]], two in [[Mah\u00e9 district]] and one in [[Yanam district]] drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.\n\n===Districts of Union Territory of Puducherry===\n[[File:Puducherry Map.svg|thumb|Map showing the districts of Puducherry]]\n* [[Puducherry district]] is an enclave of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n* [[Mah\u00e9 district]] is an enclave of [[Kerala]].\n* [[Yanam district]] is an enclave of [[Andhra Pradesh]].\n* [[Karaikal district]] is an enclave of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=2,46,354|13=1911|14=2,57,179|15=1921|16=2,44,156|17=1931|18=2,58,628|19=1941|20=2,85,011|21=1951|22=3,17,253|23=1961|24=3,69,079|25=1971|26=4,71,707|27=1981|28=6,04,471|29=1991|30=8,07,785|31=2001|32=9,74,345|33=2011|34=12,47,953|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Puducherry\n|label1 = [[Hinduism]]\n|color1 = Orange\n|value1 = 87.3\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|value2 = 6.2\n|label3 = [[Islam]]\n|color3 = Green\n|value3 = 6\n}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] is the major religion with 87.3% of the population adhering to it.

The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions a marketplace named ''Poduke'' (ch 60). [[G. W. B. Huntingford]] suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of [[Arikamedu]] (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century\" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BC to the eighth century AD.<ref>\n{{cite web | title=The Dating of Arikamedu and its Bearing on the Archaeology of Early Historical South India | author=Vimala Begley | url=http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | access-date=1 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100834/http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | archive-date=1 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|date=July 2007|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-548-20943-1|page=119|access-date=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517054619/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondich\u00e9ry) became a French colony of the [[French colonial empire]]. Together with [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]] (already French since 1673), [[Mah\u00e9, Puducherry|Mah\u00e9]] (since 1721), [[Yanam]] ([[Yanaon]]) (since 1731), [[Karaikal]] (Karikal) (since 1739) and [[Masulipatam]] (1760), it formed the French colony of [[French India]], under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] occupations. The territories of [[French India]] were completely transferred to the Republic of India de facto on 1 November 1954, and de jure on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian constituent union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves (with the exception of [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]], which merged with the state of [[West Bengal]] in 1954).\n\n==Geography==\n{{further|List of rivers of Puducherry}}\nThe Union Territory of Puducherry consists of [[List of districts of Puducherry|four small unconnected districts]]: [[Puducherry district]] ({{cvt|293|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}), [[Karaikal district]] ({{cvt|161|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) and [[Yanam district]] ({{cvt|20|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Mah\u00e9 district]] ({{cvt|9|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Laccadive Sea]], covering a total area of {{cvt|483|sqkm|sqmi}}. Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both [[enclaves]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Yanam and Mah\u00e9 are enclaves of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]], respectively. Its population, as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]], is 1,244,464.\n\nSome of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called \"pockets\" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mah\u00e9 region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] with Puducherry retaining the borders of former [[French India]].\n\nAll four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region.

The company designs, develops, manufactures and maintains aircraft, aero-engines, aerospace components and aerostructures.\n\nEstablished in 1884 as ''Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A.'', it shares its ancestry with motor vehicle manufacturer [[Piaggio]] and is one of the world's oldest aircraft manufacturers, having produced its first aircraft during 1915. The company's facilities were rebuilt following the [[World War II|Second World War]] and several original designs, including the [[Piaggio P.136|P.136]] [[seaplane]], the [[Piaggio P.149|P.149]] trainer aircraft, and the [[Piaggio P.166|P.166]] utility transport, were released during the first two decades of the [[postwar]] era. During the 1960s, Piaggio began manufacturing [[jet engine]]s as well. During 1966, the business was separated into the aviation-focused ''Piaggio Aero'' and the [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]] manufacturer [[Vespa]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, Piaggio developed a new generation [[business aircraft]], the [[Piaggio P.180 Avanti|P.180 Avanti]]. During the late 1990s, Piaggio underwent drastic changes following its [[bankruptcy]]. The company was negatively impacted by the [[Great Recession]] and the downturn in the [[business aircraft]] market. During late 2018, the company entered into [[receivership]] after having declared itself [[insolvent]]. The firm owns a subsidiary in the [[United States]], ''Piaggio America'', located at [[West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Piaggo Focke-Wulf 149.jpg|thumb|A [[Piaggio P.149]]]]\n[[File:Piaggio P166 Albatross ZU-NJZ (Ex SAAF 898) (2) (6925889329).jpg|thumb|A [[Piaggio P.166]] in flight]]\n\nThe Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A. company was founded in [[Genoa]], Italy, in 1884.<ref name = \"corp history\">{{cite web |url = http://www.piaggioaerospace.it/en/corporate |title = Corporate: History |publisher = Piaggio Aerospace |accessdate = 27 March 2020}}</ref> Originally, the company was involved in the outfitting of [[ocean liner]]s and the manufacturing of [[rolling stock]] for the developing Italian railway infrastructure around the turn of the century. From the financial gains that it had garnered from these industries, Rinaldo Piaggio was able to construct a large factory based in [[Final Marina]] during 1906.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In 1915, during the opening years of the [[World War I|First World War]], the company produced its first Piaggio-branded aircraft.<ref name = \"corp history\"/>\n\nThe 1920s was a particularly turbulent and influential period in the company's history; Piaggio Aero brought on two new [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]s, Giovanni Pegna and [[Giuseppe Gabrielli]], who both played a major role in developing Piaggio's aeronautical sector. Penga and Gabrielli worked together to create numerous technical solutions to aviation problems; to support their aerodynamic research, in 1928, Piaggio completed an innovative [[wind tunnel]].<ref name = \"corp history\"/> The firm eventually helped to bring forth the design and construction of the world's first [[helicopter]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring 1938, Senator Rinaldo Piaggio died at 71 years old, thus ending the Rinaldo Piaggio era. That same year, the firm finished construction of the new [[Piaggio P.108]] heavy bomber, its first four-engined aircraft.<ref name = \"corp history\"/> During the battles and widespread devastation of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Piaggio's facilities were reduced to ruins. Rinaldo's sons Enrico, inventor of the [[Vespa]] motor scooter, and Armando, played key roles in the [[postwar]] rebuilding process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1948, Piaggio launched the [[Piaggio P.136]], a twin-engine seaplane that was operated by the [[Italian Air Force]] and various other operators, often in liaison/sea transport capacity. The company also benefited from an increased demand for basic aircraft training; during 1953, the [[German Air Force]] ordered 265 [[Piaggio P.149]] trainers.

Thomas & [[Dusty Springfield]]; season 4\n*[[Joe Chemay]], [[Jim Haas]], Jon Joyce and [[George Merrill (songwriter)|George Merrill]] (singing a capella); season 6, part of 7, series finale\n\nThere were nine versions of the theme song used; others included a Halloween-themed version not sung by Thomas or Warnes used in a two-part Halloween episode in 1990. A shorter version of the Thomas/Warnes version was used starting in season two.\n\nThere was also an [[a cappella]] version of the song which was used for all of season six, but this version was abandoned for most of season seven in favor of the reinstatement of Thomas' and Warnes' duet version, although the a cappella theme returned for three episodes as well as the series finale. A full-length version by Thomas and Springfield was released as a single in 1988.\n\nA soundtrack was released in 1988 titled ''Steve Dorff and Friends: Growing Pains and Other Hit TV Themes.''  The soundtrack contains songs penned by Dorff from his television series theme songs and three tracks from ''Growing Pains'':\n\n# Theme Song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" (B.J. Thomas and Dusty Springfield)\n# Aloha Episode \u2013 \"Swept Away\" by Christopher Cross\n# Graduation Day Episode \u2013 \"This Is The Day\" performed by B.J. Thomas\n\nThe Theme for Growing Pains got airplay on the Adult Contemporary format in early 1989 and peaked at #5 on the Radio & Records AC chart and #7 on the Billboard AC chart.\n\nAnother version of \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" was performed by [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Eric Carmen]] in 1988.

This is followed by a series of photos of each cast member from their childhood onward ending with a clip from the show. The credits closed with another shot of the cast in front of the Seaver house before they all run inside. Starting in the second season, several different versions of the opening sequence were filmed. Whoever was the last to go into the house would usually be the focus of that week's episode.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe opening used in seasons six and seven featured opening and shot of the mantle on the Seavers' fireplace panning over photos of the cast. The photos of the cast from childhood remained but instead of clips from the show, current still photos were used. Some versions of these credits end with another shot of the mantle while others close with a montage of group shots from the same family photo shoot which the current photos used in the rest of the credits come from.\n\n===Theme song===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nThe show's theme song is \"As Long as We've Got Each Other\", which was written and composed by [[John Bettis]] (lyrics) and [[Steve Dorff]] (music). It was performed by:\n*[[B.J. Thomas]] (singing solo); season 1\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Jennifer Warnes]]; seasons 2, 3, 5, part of 7\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Dusty Springfield]]; season 4\n*[[Joe Chemay]], [[Jim Haas]], Jon Joyce and [[George Merrill (songwriter)|George Merrill]] (singing a capella); season 6, part of 7, series finale\n\nThere were nine versions of the theme song used; others included a Halloween-themed version not sung by Thomas or Warnes used in a two-part Halloween episode in 1990. A shorter version of the Thomas/Warnes version was used starting in season two.\n\nThere was also an [[a cappella]] version of the song which was used for all of season six, but this version was abandoned for most of season seven in favor of the reinstatement of Thomas' and Warnes' duet version, although the a cappella theme returned for three episodes as well as the series finale. A full-length version by Thomas and Springfield was released as a single in 1988.\n\nA soundtrack was released in 1988 titled ''Steve Dorff and Friends: Growing Pains and Other Hit TV Themes.''  The soundtrack contains songs penned by Dorff from his television series theme songs and three tracks from ''Growing Pains'':\n\n# Theme Song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" (B.J. Thomas and Dusty Springfield)\n# Aloha Episode \u2013 \"Swept Away\" by Christopher Cross\n# Graduation Day Episode \u2013 \"This Is The Day\" performed by B.J. Thomas\n\nThe Theme for Growing Pains got airplay on the Adult Contemporary format in early 1989 and peaked at #5 on the Radio & Records AC chart and #7 on the Billboard AC chart. \n\nAnother version of \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" was performed by [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Eric Carmen]] in 1988.  Their version peaked at #51 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Country chart.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n{{:List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Second. they must distribute this water to the field of the beneficiary farmers by means of a suitable and proper distribution.\nSo that in Lift Irrigation system, the gravity flow of water by [[canal]]s or [[river]] is not available or used.\n\n==Distribution==\nOf these two issues, distribution is the most complex, for several reasons.  First, whereas the system for collecting water at the main delivery chamber makes use of pumps, the distribution system is typically completely gravity-based, and have to be designed solely on the basis of the available [[hydraulic head]].  In addition, the area to be irrigated is scattered and has varying [[topography]], and each farm is of a different size, so it can be a challenge to design a gravity-based system that allots each farmer a fair amount of water.  Several mechanisms have been developed to meet these challenges.\n\nIn the most prevalent system, the area under irrigation is divided into different blocks according to topography determined by contour plan.  The water requirement for each block is determined, and pipe lines are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge.  Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution pipe lines, and valves are fitted to control the flow of the pipe lines, with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves.  In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.\n\nIn other systems, the area is divided into three or four equal parts, and each part is given the entire discharge for one day. This means each part gets rotation of the full design discharge on the fourth or fifth day.  Again, however, water distribution can be unequal, and alternate methods of distribution have been proposed to deal with this problem.\n\n== List of lift irrigation schemes with Equal and Proportionate Distribution ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So as to bring higher level area under irrigation L.I.S. are taken up. The 8% of Maharashtra irrigation is occupied by lift irrigation.\n\n==Advantages of Lift Irrigation==\n#Lift irrigation made irrigation possible at higher level.\n#Land acquisition problem in L.I.S. is less.\n#Water losses are low.\n#Man power is less used.\n\n==Requirements of Lift Irrigation System (LIS)==\n:''Water Source''-Suitable and constant water source should be available for whole year at the site of LIS. Water can be made available through Dams, [[Weir]], River canal etc.\n:''Lifting Medium''-To lift water to the desired location, lifting medium i.e. pumps are required. Depending upon the Duty point head, discharge the different types of pumps are selected.\n:''Conveying Medium''-Rising main may be of [[steel]], [[concrete]] or any other suitable material.\n\n==Lift Irrigation Scheme in Telangana==\nIn India, the [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] reports that there are 1401 lift irrigation schemes financed by them.  These schemes irrigate 22000 hectares of land, and have a total financial outlay of Rs. 6462.5 million. However, as many as 573 of these schemes are defunct, mainly due to poor distribution of water. Other schemes have been financed by the [[Government of India|government]], sugar factories, or individual farmers. \n\nWater shortage is a huge predicament for a country like India which still relies on [[monsoon]] rains for much of its agricultural practices. As weather patterns become increasingly uncertain with time, most likely due to [[global warming]], being prepared to cope with water shortages in the future is essential. Rural communities as well as huge population which are greatly affected by [[water scarcity]] are the people living in drought-prone areas or in semi-arid up-lands. Much of these disadvantaged areas are also inhibited by tribal villages in many parts of India and are also backward in agricultural practices. These tribal villages are mainly self-sustained in their living habits and rely heavily on the paddy crops for endurance. It is becoming progressively more intricate to maintain tribal lifestyle due to uncertain weather patterns resulting in dwindling of agricultural production over time and all the more increasing the burden on state to raise their standard of living in terms of [[food security]], education, and health care. It is also seen, when time gets tough, villagers generally tend to migrate on a seasonal basis to seek other means of livelihood. Such seasonal migration of entire village population also affects their settled life hampering their children\u2019s education as well as their access to other developmental support coming from state.\n\nIt is consequently important to help their agriculture instead in order to reduce the incidence of [[Human migration|migration]] in such areas. This can only be achieved by ensuring there is sufficient crop to feed villagers and to sell at market to allow income generation. Irrigation is the essential input to the soil for any vegetation to grow. It is used to lend a hand in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and potentials of vegetation by restoring humidity / [[humus]] in depleted soils of dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include shielding plants against frost, suppressing weed and wild vegetation in grain fields and helping in preventing [[soil erosion]]. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed agriculture, or if it falls in semi-arid regions, it is called dry land farming. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and subsurface water from a given area. Various types of [[irrigation]] techniques differ in how the water obtained from the source, and is distributed within the field. In general, the aim is to supply water homogeneously to the entire field, so that each land patch has enough amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation Schemes primarily comprises canal irrigation and lift irrigation schemes. In such schemes, the most important and yet the most neglected part is the local ownership and institutions of farmers taking operative and m responsibilities.\n\n==Participatory Irrigation Management==\nThe main purpose of the irrigation reform programme in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is to improve the sustainability and productivity of irrigation through sharing irrigation management responsibility with the farmers organized as Water Users Associations. Towards this the State government enacted the Andhra Pradesh Farmers Management of Irrigation System Act in 1997. Presently, water users\u2019 organizations under the APFMIS Act is constituted at three different levels in major irrigation projects - [[Water user associations|Water Users Associations]] (WUAs) at the minor canal level, Distributor Committees (DCs) at the distributor canal level and Project Committee (PCs) at the main canal level. In medium irrigation project they are constituted at two levels \u2013 WUA at the minor canal level and PC at the main canal level. In minor irrigation tanks only a WUA is constituted covering the whole tank command. A total of 10,748 WUAs have been constituted \u2013 2261 in major irrigation projects, 410 in medium irrigation projects and 8077 in minor irrigation tanks.\n\nThe water users\u2019 organizations undertake the responsibilities of seasonal crop planning and irrigation water regulation, O&M works on canal system and assist in tax collection. To facilitate the functioning of the water users\u2019 organizations the State government re-ploughs 100% of the irrigation water tax collected from them. The water tax collection and [[plough back]] for O&M to water users\u2019 organizations over the last 5 years is given in the Table below:<ref>[http://www.naandi.org/anual_report/2004-2005.pdf Naandi Annual Report 2004-2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.naandi.org/anual_report/1_Naandi_AR%2805-06%29.pdf Naandi Annual Report 2005-2006]</ref><ref name=\"li_case\">[http://liftirrigation.org/html/case_study.html Case study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207025644/http://liftirrigation.org/html/case_study.html |date=2005-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Collection (in Rs. million)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | O&M Plan (in Rs. millions)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Plough Back (in Rs. millions)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Budgetary Support (in Rs. millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2005-06\n|560\n|NA\n|0\n|0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2006-07\n|670\n|NA\n|300\n|0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2007-08\n|750\n|NA\n|300\n|0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2008-09\n|1150\n|2000\n|600\n|1400\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2009-10\n|1320 (Projected)\n|1600\n|1000\n|600\n|}\n\n==Maintenance of Lift Irrigation Schemes in AP==\nIn Andhra Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh State Irrigation Development Corporation (APSIDC) was established in 1974 to exploit the ground and surface water potential through lifts in a big way. Till now APSIDC has constructed around 1150 Lift Irrigation Schemes, creating an irrigation potential of 430000 acres. There are several LIS constructed by Irrigation & Power Department, private farmers and farmer societies, creating an irrigation potential of about 2,70,000 acres. The schemes constructed by I & P D are being maintained by the department even now. APSIDC has constructed some schemes with the share capital (25%) given by the government and the balance 75% capital raised through Nationalized banks refinanced by NABARD. These schemes were maintained by APSIDC (IDC) till 1995. Later all these schemes were either handed over to the farmer's societies for maintenance or kept under lock and key. Some other schemes were constructed by IDC on agency basis as deposit works. These were handed over either to the beneficiary societies or sponsoring agencies for maintenance after commissioning.<ref name=\"li_case\"/>\n\n==Maintenance of the LI Scheme by the Beneficiary Committee Society==\nThere are several parameters influencing the maintainability of LIS by the beneficiaries. The inter and intra village rivalries, the empowerment and social involvement levels of the farmers, the electricity tariff rates (now it has been made free), quality and quantity of power supply, the quality and performance of different components of the LIS and the performance of whole LIS as a system etc.\nThe Tyullar LIS was handed over to the beneficiaries during 2008. The scheme is being maintained by the beneficiaries successfully from 2008.\n\nThe profit and loss statement of the Tyullar LI Society shows that income over expenditure in the last 3 years is Rs 22, 12,551/- The society is cash rich and ready to meet any un-expected expenditure due to any contingency in the scheme. This ensures sustainability of maintenance by the society.\n\n==Farmer\u2019s Associations manage LI Schemes and pay for O&M==\nOne of the main issues confronting irrigation system transfer is to decide on who would pay the cost of operation and maintenance of the system. APSIDC has handed over the LI schemes to Farmer\u2019s Associations to operate, maintain and manage.\nThe Farmers\u2019 Association members, who take over a scheme, will sign an agreement among themselves to share water as well as the cost of operation and maintenance equitably. The basis of each family\u2019s contribution will be worked out by the members and included in the annex to the MOA between the FA and APSIDC.

Second. they must distribute this water to the field of the beneficiary farmers by means of a suitable and proper distribution.\nSo that in Lift Irrigation system, the gravity flow of water by [[canal]]s or [[river]] is not available or used.\n\n==Distribution==\nOf these two issues, distribution is the most complex, for several reasons.  First, whereas the system for collecting water at the main delivery chamber makes use of pumps, the distribution system is typically completely gravity-based, and have to be designed solely on the basis of the available [[hydraulic head]].  In addition, the area to be irrigated is scattered and has varying [[topography]], and each farm is of a different size, so it can be a challenge to design a gravity-based system that allots each farmer a fair amount of water.  Several mechanisms have been developed to meet these challenges.\n\nIn the most prevalent system, the area under irrigation is divided into different blocks according to topography determined by contour plan.  The water requirement for each block is determined, and pipe lines are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge.  Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution pipe lines, and valves are fitted to control the flow of the pipe lines, with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves.  In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.\n\nIn other systems, the area is divided into three or four equal parts, and each part is given the entire discharge for one day. This means each part gets rotation of the full design discharge on the fourth or fifth day.  Again, however, water distribution can be unequal, and alternate methods of distribution have been proposed to deal with this problem.\n\n== List of lift irrigation schemes with Equal and Proportionate Distribution ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So as to bring higher level area under irrigation L.I.S. are taken up. The 8% of Maharashtra irrigation is occupied by lift irrigation.\n\n==Advantages of Lift Irrigation==\n#Lift irrigation made irrigation possible at higher level.\n#Land acquisition problem in L.I.S. is less.\n#Water losses are low.\n#Man power is less used.\n\n==Requirements of Lift Irrigation System (LIS)==\n:''Water Source''-Suitable and constant water source should be available for whole year at the site of LIS. Water can be made available through Dams, [[Weir]], River canal etc.\n:''Lifting Medium''-To lift water to the desired location, lifting medium i.e. pumps are required. Depending upon the Duty point head, discharge the different types of pumps are selected.\n:''Conveying Medium''-Rising main may be of [[steel]], [[concrete]] or any other suitable material.\n\n==Lift Irrigation Scheme in Telangana==\nIn India, the [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] reports that there are 1401 lift irrigation schemes financed by them.  These schemes irrigate 22000 hectares of land, and have a total financial outlay of Rs. 6462.5 million. However, as many as 573 of these schemes are defunct, mainly due to poor distribution of water. Other schemes have been financed by the [[Government of India|government]], sugar factories, or individual farmers. \n\nWater shortage is a huge predicament for a country like India which still relies on [[monsoon]] rains for much of its agricultural practices. As weather patterns become increasingly uncertain with time, most likely due to [[global warming]], being prepared to cope with water shortages in the future is essential. Rural communities as well as huge population which are greatly affected by [[water scarcity]] are the people living in drought-prone areas or in semi-arid up-lands. Much of these disadvantaged areas are also inhibited by tribal villages in many parts of India and are also backward in agricultural practices. These tribal villages are mainly self-sustained in their living habits and rely heavily on the paddy crops for endurance. It is becoming progressively more intricate to maintain tribal lifestyle due to uncertain weather patterns resulting in dwindling of agricultural production over time and all the more increasing the burden on state to raise their standard of living in terms of [[food security]], education, and health care. It is also seen, when time gets tough, villagers generally tend to migrate on a seasonal basis to seek other means of livelihood. Such seasonal migration of entire village population also affects their settled life hampering their children\u2019s education as well as their access to other developmental support coming from state.\n\nIt is consequently important to help their agriculture instead in order to reduce the incidence of migration in such areas. This can only be achieved by ensuring there is sufficient crop to feed villagers and to sell at market to allow income generation. Irrigation is the essential input to the soil for any vegetation to grow. It is used to lend a hand in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and potentials of vegetation by restoring humidity / [[humus]] in depleted soils of dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include shielding plants against frost, suppressing weed and wild vegetation in grain fields and helping in preventing [[soil erosion]]. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed agriculture, or if it falls in semi-arid regions, it is called dry land farming. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area. Various types of irrigation techniques differ in how the water obtained from the source, and is distributed within the field. In general, the aim is to supply water homogeneously to the entire field, so that each land patch has enough amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation Schemes primarily comprises canal irrigation and lift irrigation schemes. In such schemes, the most important and yet the most neglected part is the local ownership and institutions of farmers taking operative and m responsibilities.\n\n==Participatory Irrigation Management==\nThe main purpose of the irrigation reform programme in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is to improve the sustainability and productivity of irrigation through sharing irrigation management responsibility with the farmers organized as Water Users Associations. Towards this the State government enacted the Andhra Pradesh Farmers Management of Irrigation System Act in 1997. Presently, water users\u2019 organizations under the APFMIS Act is constituted at three different levels in major irrigation projects - [[Water user associations|Water Users Associations]] (WUAs) at the minor canal level, Distributor Committees (DCs) at the distributor canal level and Project Committee (PCs) at the main canal level. In medium irrigation project they are constituted at two levels \u2013 WUA at the minor canal level and PC at the main canal level. In minor irrigation tanks only a WUA is constituted covering the whole tank command. A total of 10,748 WUAs have been constituted \u2013 2261 in major irrigation projects, 410 in medium irrigation projects and 8077 in minor irrigation tanks.\n\nThe water users\u2019 organizations undertake the responsibilities of seasonal crop planning and irrigation water regulation, O&M works on canal system and assist in tax collection. To facilitate the functioning of the water users\u2019 organizations the State government re-ploughs 100% of the irrigation water tax collected from them. The water tax collection and [[plough back]] for O&M to water users\u2019 organizations over the last 5 years is given in the Table below:<ref>[http://www.naandi.org/anual_report/2004-2005.pdf Naandi Annual Report 2004-2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.naandi.org/anual_report/1_Naandi_AR%2805-06%29.pdf Naandi Annual Report 2005-2006]</ref><ref name=\"li_case\">[http://liftirrigation.org/html/case_study.html Case study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207025644/http://liftirrigation.org/html/case_study.html |date=2005-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Collection (in Rs. million)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | O&M Plan (in Rs. millions)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Plough Back (in Rs. millions)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Budgetary Support (in Rs. millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2005-06\n|560\n|NA\n|0\n|0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2006-07\n|670\n|NA\n|300\n|0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2007-08\n|750\n|NA\n|300\n|0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2008-09\n|1150\n|2000\n|600\n|1400\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2009-10\n|1320 (Projected)\n|1600\n|1000\n|600\n|}\n\n==Maintenance of Lift Irrigation Schemes in AP==\nIn Andhra Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh State Irrigation Development Corporation (APSIDC) was established in 1974 to exploit the ground and surface water potential through lifts in a big way. Till now APSIDC has constructed around 1150 Lift Irrigation Schemes, creating an irrigation potential of 430000 acres. There are several LIS constructed by Irrigation & Power Department, private farmers and farmer societies, creating an irrigation potential of about 2,70,000 acres. The schemes constructed by I & P D are being maintained by the department even now. APSIDC has constructed some schemes with the share capital (25%) given by the government and the balance 75% capital raised through Nationalized banks refinanced by NABARD. These schemes were maintained by APSIDC (IDC) till 1995. Later all these schemes were either handed over to the farmer's societies for maintenance or kept under lock and key. Some other schemes were constructed by IDC on agency basis as deposit works. These were handed over either to the beneficiary societies or sponsoring agencies for maintenance after commissioning.<ref name=\"li_case\"/>\n\n==Maintenance of the LI Scheme by the Beneficiary Committee Society==\nThere are several parameters influencing the maintainability of LIS by the beneficiaries. The inter and intra village rivalries, the empowerment and social involvement levels of the farmers, the electricity tariff rates (now it has been made free), quality and quantity of power supply, the quality and performance of different components of the LIS and the performance of whole LIS as a system etc.\nThe Tyullar LIS was handed over to the beneficiaries during 2008. The scheme is being maintained by the beneficiaries successfully from 2008.\n\nThe profit and loss statement of the Tyullar LI Society shows that income over expenditure in the last 3 years is Rs 22, 12,551/- The society is cash rich and ready to meet any un-expected expenditure due to any contingency in the scheme. This ensures sustainability of maintenance by the society.\n\n==Farmer\u2019s Associations manage LI Schemes and pay for O&M==\nOne of the main issues confronting irrigation system transfer is to decide on who would pay the cost of operation and maintenance of the system. APSIDC has handed over the LI schemes to Farmer\u2019s Associations to operate, maintain and manage.\nThe Farmers\u2019 Association members, who take over a scheme, will sign an agreement among themselves to share water as well as the cost of operation and maintenance equitably. The basis of each family\u2019s contribution will be worked out by the members and included in the annex to the MOA between the FA and APSIDC. The SO will facilitate this process and may sign as a witness.\n\n==Social Engineering Activities==\nCapacity Building and community organization are the most important factors in strengthening the Lift Irrigation Societies. There are many defunct LI Schemes existing in [[Andhra Pradesh]], the main reason is the stakeholders did not have the capacity to run by themselves as per the guidelines envisaged. Therefore, the AP State Irrigation Development Corporation has decided to entrust the aspect of Social Engineering component to the identified NGO\u2019s (Support Organization) with a view to make the scheme sustainable.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Irrigation]]\n[[Category:Irrigation in India]]\n[[Category:Lift irrigation schemes| ]]\n", "name_user": "Cavan.hill", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling Corrections and Article linking.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_irrigation"}

This district is known for the [[Baidyanath Temple|Baidyanath Jyotirlinga]] shrine and is a part of [[Santhal Pargana division]]. Deoghar is a Hindi word meaning of \u2018Deoghar\u2019 is abode (\u2018ghar\u2019) of the Gods and Goddesses (\u2018dev\u2019). Deoghar is also known as \u201cBaidyanath Dham\u201d, \u201cBaba Dham\u201d, \u201cB. Deoghar\u201d.\n\n==History==\nThe district was formed on 1 June 1981 by separating Deoghar sub-division of the erstwhile [[Santhal Parganas|Santhal Pargana]] district.\n[[File:A View of the Pagodas at Deogar.JPG|left|thumb|A View of the Pagodas at Deoghar]]\n\n==Geography==\nDeoghar district is located in the western portion of Santhal Parganas. It\nis bounded by Banka and Jamui district in the north, Dumka in east and Jamtara in south and Giridhih in\nwest. The district extends from 24\n0\n03' and 23\n0\n38' N latitude and 86\n0\n28' and\n87\n0\n04' E longitude and has an area of 2481km<sup>2</sup>. It had a population of {{formatnum:1,491,879}}\npeople according to the 2011 [[Census of India]].\n\nThe district contains several clusters of rocky hills covered with forest, with a series of long ridges with intervening depressions. Most of the rolling highlands are cultivated by highland crops. The average elevation of the district is 247 m above mean sea level, however, hill ranges like Phuljari (750 m), Teror (670 m) and Degaria (575 m) break the monotony of the landscape. The general slope of the district is from northwest to southeast. Geologically the district is mainly covered by Chhota Nagpur granite gneiss of Archean age with patches of alluvium, sandstone and shale of Gondwana formations. Important rivers flowing in the district include the Ajay and the Paltro. These rivers gather a large number of tributaries that form the landscape full of Tanrs and Dons.\n\n[[File:Navlakha Temple 3.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Naulakha Temple]]\n\n===Cities and villages===\nTaluk Name State Deoghar, Madhupur, Chitra, Sarsa Kushmaha, Majhiyana, Tharidulampur, Jamua, Charakmara, Palojori, Devipur, Sarwan, Sarath, Karon, Mohanpur, Rohni, babangaua, Ghorlash, Jasidih, Koridih, Raihdih, Gidhaiya, Jitjori.\n\n===Climate===\nThe district experiences a hot summer, which normally lasts from March to May.

'''Nandan Pahar'''\nNandan Pahar is an amusement park built on top of a hill in the district of Deoghar in Jharkhand, India. The park attracts visitors from nearby localities from almost all age groups.{{fact|date=March 2019}} \nNandan Pahar consists of a garden, a pond, and serves as an amusement or recreational park with several joy rides within the green garden.{{fact|date=March 2019}} There are theme houses at the park too.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The Nandi temple, which is situated on the top of Nandan Pahar, is very famous in the locality.{{fact|date=March 2019}} Nandan Pahar is managed and promoted by the Jharkhand State Tourism Development Corporation. \n\n3.'''Tapovan Caves and Hills'''\nLocated 10  km from Deoghar, this place has a temple of Shiva called Taponath Mahadeva and several caves are also present there. In one of the caves, there is a Shiva lingam installed and it is said that Sage Valmiki came here for penance.\n\n4.'''Naulakha Mandir'''\nSituated 1.5  km from the main temple, this temple measures 146  ft high and is very similar to the temple of Ramakrishna in Belur.

The crowd at the temple drastically increases in the month of Shravan, when not only local and national tourists but also international visitors visit.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt is widely believed that the Basukinath Temple is the court of Baba Bhole Nath. The temples of Shiva and Parvati are located just in front of each other in the Basukinath Temple. The gates of both of these temples open in the evening, and it is believed that Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati meet each other at this time. Thus, devotees are asked to move away from the front gates of the temple. Other small temples that are dedicated to different Gods and Goddesses can also be found inside the compound.\n\n6.Satsang Nagar\n\n7.Rikhiyapith\n\n8.Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith\n\n9.Balanand shram<ref>https://www.holidify.com/places/deoghar/basukinath-sightseeing-1735.html</ref>\n\n===Saawan Mela===\nThe importance of Babadham increases during the month of Shrawan. During this period, lakhs of devotees throng the Baba Baidyanath temple. Most of the tourists first visit Sultanganj, which is 108  km from Babadham.\n\nIn Sultanganj, the Ganges flows to the North. It is from this place that the devotees collect water in their kanwars and carry the holy Ganges water, with the kanwars on their shoulders. They walk 109  km up to Baba Baidyanath temple at Babadham reciting Bol Bam on the way.\n\nOn reaching Babadham, the kanwarias first take a dip in the Shivaganga to purify themselves and then enter the Baba Baidyanath temple, where the Ganges water is offered to the Jyotirlingam.\n\nThis pilgrimage continues during the whole of Shravan for 30 days, from July\u2013August. This is the longest religious fair in the world.\n\nPeople from foreign lands also visit Babadham not only during Shrawan month but also during the rest of the year.\n\nThe sight on the way from Sultanganj to Babadham is of a 109  km long human chain of saffron-clad pilgrims. It is estimated that within this period of one month around 5.0 to 5.5  million pilgrims visit Babadham.\n\nBesides the great pilgrimage of Shrawan, almost the whole year remains under fair with Shivaratri in March, Basant Panchami in January, Bhadra Purnima in September.\nAlso here Rikhiya ashram famous in world{{fact|date=March 2019}} for its meditation camp along with the Ramniwas Ashram of Saint Balanand Brahmachari, Mohan Mandir of Mohananand Swami, Kailash Pahar Ashram-Jasidih of Swami Hansdev Avadhoot.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Temples and Holy places in and around Deoghar District===\n\nAjgaibinath (Ajit),\nBaiju Temple,\nBasukinath,\nDeva Sangha Math,\nDolmanch,\nHarila Jori,\nHathi Pahar or Mahadevatari,\nJain Temple,\nKailash Pahar Ashram,\nKathikund Daninath Shiva Temple,\nKundeshwari,\nJagrat Kunda Kali Mandir,\nLila Temple,\nSeva Nikunj,\nMansarovar,\nNandan Pahar,\nNaulakha Temple,\nPagla Baba Ashram,\nRikhia Ashram,\nRam Krishna Mission Vidyapeeth,\nSatsang Nagar and Ashram,\nShitala Temple,\nShivaganga,\nShiv Mandir Chitra,\nTapovan,\nChitra coalyari (Jamua) \nTrikuta Parvata.\n\n====Other temples====\n*Taapovan.\n* Naulakha Temple, Deoghar\n* Trikuti Pahar, Mohanpur\n* Budhai Mandir, Madhupur\n* Basuki Nath Temple,\n* Pathrol, Kali Mandirw\n* Nayak Dham, Ganjobari Near Joramow Railway Station.\n* Dindakoli [[Durga]] and Shiva mandir\n* Karon [[Shiva]] mandir\n* Dubay baba mandir dakai (sarwan)\n* Masan Baba Temple (With Mahakali and [[Batuk Bhairav]]) - Very auspicious as Deoghar is one of the Chhita Bhumi where it is believed that Lord Shiva comes and applies Bhasm from Chhita\n\n==Education==\nDeoghar College in Deoghar town was founded in 1951.

The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nA dust speck is dislodged from its obscure place and sent adrift through the Jungle of Nool.  At the same time, [[Horton the Elephant]], the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, takes a dip in the pool.  The dust speck floats past him in the air, and he hears a tiny yelp coming from it.  Believing that an entire society of microscopic creatures are living on that speck, he gives chase to it before placing it on top of a flower.  Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of [[Whoville]] and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife Sally, 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H, and one teenage son named JoJo.  Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo doesn't want to be the next mayor, and because he is so scared of disappointing his father, he never talks. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange [[phenomena]] ([[earthquakes]] and changes in the [[weather]]), and the Mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the Town Council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending Chairman.\n\nAfter he makes contact with Horton, the Mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a \"safer, more stable home\".  With the help of his best friend Morton, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle.  The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses.  Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys who like to cause anybody havoc and misery.  Eventually, the Kangaroo enlists a sinister [[vulture]] named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force.\n\nAfter a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the flower  away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville.  After unsuccessfully picking 2,999,999 flowers Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower).  The Kangaroo eventually finds out, thanks to Mrs. Quilligan, that Horton still has the speck, and she rallies the jungle community into fighting Horton, saying that his goal will lead to anarchy.  Upon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence.  Horton refuses and, despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the  Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed in a pot of beezlenut oil.  The Mayor enlists all of his people to make noise by shouting \"We are here!\", as well as playing a variety of instruments, so that all the animals may hear them, assisted by JoJo's \"Symphonophone\", an invention which creates a huge musical contribution and reveals that JoJo's \"true\" passion is music, but still fails to penetrate the surface of the speck.\n\nThe Kangaroo snatches the flower from the weakened and captured Horton and drops it in the pot.  Meanwhile, JoJo grabs the horn used to project Horton's voice, runs up the highest tower, and screams \"YOPP!\", breaking through the sound barrier just seconds before the speck hits the oil.  Rudy, the Kangaroo's son, grabs the flower and proclaims he can hear it, and the other animals of Nool notice that they can hear it too.  Despite his mother's objections, Rudy returns the flower  to the released and recovered Horton.  Realizing the truth about the Whos' existence, the animals isolate the Kangaroo for tricking them.  While being praised for his integrity by his neighbors, Horton even forgives the devastated Kangaroo, and she befriends him with a makeshift umbrella for Whoville.  The film ends with the people of Whoville and the animals of Nool gathering to recite the chorus from \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\", with the narrator revealing that the Jungle of Nool (and [[Earth]] as a whole) is just one speck, like Whoville, among numerous others, floating in outer space.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Horton the Elephant|Horton]], an outgoing, eccentric, big-hearted, loving, sweet, and thoughtful elephant and teacher in the Jungle of Nool.

A major theme regards learning about universal values between vastly different places and people, as shown by the quote \"A person's a person, no matter how small\". This is employed on many levels, primarily with Horton hearing a world in a speck, while also appearing with the Mayor's relationship with his son, and Sour Kangaroo learning the truth about the speck.<ref>\"A Person is a Person: A Universal Message\", ''Horton Hears a Who!''

The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nA dust speck is dislodged from its obscure place and sent adrift through the Jungle of Nool.  At the same time, [[Horton the Elephant]], the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, takes a dip in the pool.  The dust speck floats past him in the air, and he hears a tiny yelp coming from it.  Believing that an entire society of microscopic creatures are living on that speck, he gives chase to it before placing it on top of a flower.  Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of [[Whoville]] and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife Sally, 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H, and one teenage son named JoJo.  Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo doesn't want to be the next mayor, and because he is so scared of disappointing his father, he never talks. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange [[phenomena]] ([[earthquakes]] and changes in the [[weather]]), and the Mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the Town Council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending Chairman.\n\nAfter he makes contact with Horton, the Mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a \"safer, more stable home\".  With the help of his best friend Morton, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle.  The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses.  Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys who like to cause anybody havoc and misery.  Eventually, the Kangaroo enlists a sinister [[vulture]] named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force.\n\nAfter a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the flower  away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville.  After unsuccessfully picking 2,999,999 flowers Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower).  The Kangaroo eventually finds out, thanks to Mrs. Quilligan, that Horton still has the speck, and she rallies the jungle community into fighting Horton, saying that his goal will lead to anarchy.  Upon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence.  Horton refuses and, despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the  Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed in a pot of beezlenut oil.  The Mayor enlists all of his people to make noise by shouting \"We are here!\", as well as playing a variety of instruments, so that all the animals may hear them, assisted by JoJo's \"Symphonophone\", an invention which creates a huge musical contribution and reveals that JoJo's \"true\" passion is music, but still fails to penetrate the surface of the speck.\n\nThe Kangaroo snatches the flower from the weakened and captured Horton and drops it in the pot.  Meanwhile, JoJo grabs the horn used to project Horton's voice, runs up the highest tower, and screams \"YOPP!\", breaking through the sound barrier just seconds before the speck hits the oil.  Rudy, the Kangaroo's son, grabs the flower and proclaims he can hear it, and the other animals of Nool notice that they can hear it too.  Despite his mother's objections, Rudy returns the flower  to the released and recovered Horton.  Realizing the truth about the Whos' existence, the animals isolate the Kangaroo for tricking them.  While being praised for his integrity by his neighbors, Horton even forgives the devastated Kangaroo, and she befriends him with a makeshift umbrella for Whoville.  The film ends with the people of Whoville and the animals of Nool gathering to recite the chorus from \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\", with the narrator revealing that the Jungle of Nool (and [[Earth]] as a whole) is just one speck, like Whoville, among numerous others, floating in outer space.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Horton the Elephant|Horton]], an outgoing, eccentric, big-hearted, loving, sweet, and thoughtful elephant and teacher in the Jungle of Nool.
