Jackson|Scoop Jackson]] Democrats or [[neoconservatives]], or both. SDUSA's members had been active in the [[civil rights movement]] which had been led since the 1940s by [[A. Philip Randolph]]. SDUSA's leaders had organized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], during which [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivered his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. Under the leadership of Randolph and [[Bayard Rustin]], SDUSA championed Rustin's [[Bayard Rustin#From Protest to Politics|emphasis on economic inequality]] as the most important issue facing African Americans after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. SDUSA's efforts to reduce [[Economic inequality in the United States|economic inequality]] led to a focus on labor unions and economic policy. As a result, SDUSA members were active in the [[AFL\u2013CIO]] confederation as well as in individual unions, especially the [[American Federation of Teachers]].\n\nSDUSA's electoral strategy of [[political realignment]] intended to organize labor unions, civil rights organizations and other constituencies into a coalition that would transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party. The realignment strategy emphasized working with unions and especially the AFL\u2013CIO, putting an emphasis on economic issues that would unite working class voters. SDUSA opposed the New Politics of Senator McGovern which had lost all states other than Massachusetts to [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], when Americans voted for a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1972 United States House of Representatives elections|House elections]]. While SDUSA had endorsed McGovern, it had adopted resolutions criticizing the New Politics for having made criticisms of [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] and [[Working class in the United States|working class]] Americans and for its advocacy of an immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\nSDUSA's organizational activities included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers\u2014it was known mainly because of its members' activities in other organizations.

''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored [[Darlington Hoopes]] as [[1956 United States presidential election|candidate for President in 1956]] and who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the SPA no longer sponsored party candidates in elections, continued use of the name \"party\" was \"misleading\" and hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party according to the majority report. The name \"Socialist\" was replaced by \"Social Democrats\" because many American associated the term \"[[Democratic socialism|socialism]]\" with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Moreover, the organization sought to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].<ref name=\"NYT27\">{{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=7&st=p}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1972 Convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one.

The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin's article \"From Protest to Politics\" in which Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. The needs of the black community demanded a shift in political strategy, where blacks would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like) to pursue a common economic agenda. It was time to move from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.<ref name=\"RustinFPTP\"/> A particular danger facing the black community was the chimera of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of [[Black Power]] which Rustin dismissed as a fantasy of middle-class African-Americans that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] while alienating the white allies needed by the black community.<ref name=\"RustinSeparatism\"/>\n\nSDUSA documents had similar criticisms of the agendas advanced by middle class activists increasing their role in the Democratic Party. SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated role of middle-class [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace activists]] in the Democratic Party, particularly associated with the \"New Politics\" of Senator [[George McGovern]], whose [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|presidential candidacy]] was viewed as an ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the United States.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/> In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.<ref name=\"NYT74\"/>\n\nIn foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing]] of [[North Vietnam]]. They demanded a negotiated peace treaty to end the [[Vietnam War]], but the majority opposed a unilateral withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, suggesting that such a withdrawal would lead to an annihilation of the free labor unions and of the political opposition.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref>These positions had been advanced by organizations like \"[[Penn Kemble#Negotiations Now!|Negotiations Now!]]\" since the 1960s.</ref><ref name=\"Gershman\">{{cite journal|last=Gershman|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Gershman|title=Totalitarian menace (Controversies: Detente and the left after Afghanistan)|journal=Society|date=3 November 1980|issn=0147-2011|pages=9\u201315|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF02694835}}</ref> After the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam and the victory of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Viet Cong]], SDUSA supported humanitarian assistance to refugees and condemned Senator McGovern for his failure to support such assistance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The View from Washington|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=6|number=2|date=November\u2013December 1978|pages=134\u2013135|jstor=30171704|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/00927678.1978.10553935}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Carl|last=Gershman|url=https://archive.org/details/AfterTheDominoesFell|title=After the dominoes fell|journal=Commentary|date=May 1978|series=SD papers|volume=3|ref=harv|authorlink=Carl Gershman}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational activities ==\n[[File:BayardRustinAug1963-LibraryOfCongress crop.jpg|thumb|upright|National Chairman [[Bayard Rustin]], who headed SDUSA]]\nSDUSA was governed by biannual conventions which invited the participation of interested observers.

Members of SDUSA have served as officers for governmental, private and not-for-profit organizations. [[A.&nbsp;Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Norman Hill]] were leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]. [[Tom Kahn]], [[Sandra Feldman]] and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and [[Penn Kemble]] served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] was a [[public intellectual]]. Writing after the death of [[Tom Kahn]], [[Ben Wattenberg]] commented that SDUSA as an \"umbrella organization\" associated with other [[letterhead organization]]s, saying the following: <blockquote>[SDUSA members seemed to be] ingeniously trying to bury the Soviet Union in a blizzard of letterheads. It seemed that each of Tom's colleagues\u2014Penn Kemble, Carl Gershman, Josh Muravchik and many more\u2014ran a little organization, each with the same interlocking directorate listed on the stationery. Funny thing: The Letterhead Lieutenants did indeed churn up a blizzard, and the Soviet Union is no more.\n\nI never did quite get all the organizational acronyms straight\u2014YPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISL\u2014but the key words were \"democratic\", \"labor\", \"young\" and, until events redefined it away from their understanding, \"socialist\". Ultimately, the umbrella group became \"Social Democrats, U.S.A\", and Tom Kahn was a principal \"theoretician\".\n\nThey talked and wrote endlessly, mostly about communism and democracy, despising the former, adoring the latter. It is easy today to say \"anti-communist\" and \"pro-democracy\" in the same breath. But that is because American foreign policy eventually became just such a mixture, thanks in part to those \"Yipsels\" (Young People's Socialist League), with Tom Kahn as provocateur-at-large.\n\nOn the conservative side, foreign policy used to be anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but nervous about being anti-communist. Tom theorized that to be either, you had to be both.\n\nIt was tough for labor-liberal intellectuals to be \"anti-communist\" in the 1970s. It meant being taunted as \"Cold Warriors\" who saw \"Commies under every bed\" and being labeled as\u2014the unkindest cut\u2014\"right-wingers\".<ref name=\"Wattenberg\">{{cite news|date=April 22, 1992|first=Ben|last=Wattenberg|authorlink=Ben Wattenberg|title=A man whose ideas helped change the world|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 November 2011|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-04-22/news/1992113044_1_tom-kahn-foreign-policy-anti-communist|id=Syndicated: (Thursday April 23, 1993). \"[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110504812 Remembering a man who mattered]\".

This article stated that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. To pursue its economic agenda, the black community needed to shift political strategy, strengthening its political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like). As its agenda shifted from civil rights to economic justice, the black community's tactics needed to shift from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.<ref name=RustinFPTP>Rustin wrote the following reports:\n* ''Civil rights: the true frontier'' New York, N.Y.: Donald Press, 1963\n* ''From protest to politics: the future of the civil rights movement'' New York: League for Industrial Democracy, 1965\n* ''The labor-Negro coalition, a new beginning'' [Washington?

Philip Randolph Institute, 1970</ref>\n\n===== Influence on William Julius Wilson =====\nRustin's analysis was supported by the later research by [[William Julius Wilson]].<ref name=\"RKRustin\"/> Wilson documented an increase in inequality within the black community, following educated blacks moving into white suburbs and following the decrease of demand for low-skill labor as industry declined in the Northern United States. Such economic problems were not being addressed by a civil rights leadership focused on \"[[affirmative action]]\", a policy benefiting the truly advantaged within the black community. Wilson's criticism of the neglect of working class and poor African Americans by civil rights organizations led to his being mistaken for a conservative, despite his having identified himself as a Rustin-style social democrat. Wilson has served on the advisory board of Social Democrats, USA.<ref>Wilson's ''The Declining Significance of Race'' won the [[American Sociological Association]]'s [[Sydney Spivack Award]]. In ''The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions'' (1978), [[Split labor market theory|Wilson]] argues that the significance of race is waning, and an African-American's class is comparatively more important in determining his or her life chances. His ''The Truly Disadvantaged'', which was selected by the editors of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received ''The Washington Monthly'' Annual Book Award and the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award. In ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy'' (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the \"[[spatial mismatch]]\" theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global [[economic restructuring]], and hence urban [[unemployment]] increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children, since the fathers would not be breadwinners. His ''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'', which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of ''The New York Times Book Review'' and received the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award. His ''The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics'' reaffirms the need for a coalition strategy, as Rustin suggested. In Wilson's most recent book, ''More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City'' (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans. He asks the question, \"Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?\" In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education. Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers. In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors. He tries \"to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture, but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality.\" Wilson's goal is to \"rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena\" ([http://www.prrac.org/pdf/WJWMayJune2009PRRAC.pdf PDF]).</ref>\n\n==== Labor movement, trade unions and social democracy ====\nRustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the [[African American]] community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social democratic politics.\n\nHe was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL\u2013CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL\u2013CIO newspaper.\n\nOn the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]].

He also testified on behalf of New York State's Gay Rights Bill. In 1986, he gave the speech \"The new 'niggers' are gays\" in which he asserted: {{quote|Today, blacks are no longer the litmus paper or the barometer of social change.

Discharging this obligation entails risks, of course, but it is up to Solidarity, the ones on the front line, who know better than we the opportunities and dangers before them, to define the aid they need.

During her early years in the civil rights movement, Feldman worked to integrate [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants in [[Maryland]]. She soon became employment committee chairwoman of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] in [[Harlem]]. She also participated in several [[Freedom Rides]] and was arrested twice.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== Teaching ====\nUpon graduation from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1962, Feldman worked for six months as a substitute third-grade teacher in [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]]. She continued to be active in the civil rights movement, working to desegregate Howard Johnson restaurants in Maryland.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> She participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a [[master's degree]] program in literature at [[New York University]]. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]], which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won [[collective bargaining]] rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> During this time, Feldman became an associate of [[Albert Shanker]], then an organizer for the [[United Federation of Teachers]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== United Federation of Teachers ====\n{{see also|Albert Shanker|American Federation of Teachers}}\nIn 1966, Shanker\u2014now executive director of the UFT\u2014hired Feldman as a full-time field representative on the recommendation of Rustin. Over the next nine years, Feldman became the union's executive director and oversaw its staff. She was elected its secretary (the second-most powerful position in the local) in 1983.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter just two years on the UFT staff, Feldman played a crucial role in the [[American Federation of Teachers#Ocean Hill\u2013Brownsville strike|Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike]]. The city of New York had designated the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts in an effort to give the minority community more say in school affairs.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> The crisis began when the Ocean Hill-Brownsville governing board fired 13 teachers for allegedly sabotaging the decentralization experiment. Shanker demanded that specific charges be filed and the teachers given a chance to defend themselves in [[due process]] proceedings.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nA protracted fight erupted between those in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being \"Jewish-dominated\". Feldman was often at the center of the strike.<ref>Carter, ''Pickets, Parents, and Power,'' 1971.</ref> The UFT emerged from the crisis more powerful than ever and Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> Shanker was elected president of the AFT in 1974, but he retained his post as UFT President. In 1986, Shanker retired as UFT President and Feldman was elected president.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\n==== UFT President after Shanker ====\nFeldman was known for being a quiet yet very effective leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that [[Robert F. Wagner Jr. (deputy mayor)|Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and he was given a free hand.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nShe was instrumental in helping [[David Dinkins]] win election as mayor of New York in 1989 by using union members and resources to build a winning electoral coalition of black and white voters.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> However, once mayor Dinkins stalled on signing a new contract with the teachers' union and Feldman rarely criticized Dinkins publicly for his actions, but she kept the UFT out of Dinkins' 1993 re-election. Dinkins lost in a tight race to [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== American Federation of Teachers ====\nFeldman had been elected an AFT vice president in 1974,<ref>[http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/ward/aft/people.html See the list of AFT vice presidents at]</ref> serving on the national union's executive council and the executive council's executive committee.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won election as the AFT President in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew by more than 160,000 new members (about 17 percent). With Feldman as President, in 2002 AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a \"culture of organizing\" throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging in a series of publicity, legislative, funding and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work; and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nIn May 1997, Feldman was elected to the AFL\u2013CIO executive council and appointed to the executive council's executive committee. During her tenure at the head of the AFT, Feldman also served as a vice president of [[Education International]] and was a board member of the [[International Rescue Committee]] and [[Freedom House]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nFeldman died in 2005 at the age 65.<ref name=\"Feldman\">\n* ''Almanac of Famous People.'' 88th ed.

It is democracy as a way of life. What is \"democracy as a way of life.\" It is a society whose basic institutions are animated by an equality of concern for all human beings, regardless of class, race, sex, religion, and national origin, to develop themselves as persons to their fullest growth, to be free to live up to their desirable potentials as human beings. It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected.\n<!-- The Social Democrat therefore is interested in extending the area of equal opportunity beyond the political sphere to all other areas of social life. He believes that all social institutions to the extent to which they are modifiable must be judged by their, fruits or consequences an the lives of individual persons. It is from this premise of \"democracy as a way of life,\" of equal opportunity for all to develop themselves as persons, taken as a regulative moral ideal, not as an inexorable, \"dialectical\" law of history, that the social democrat derives the justification for multiple programs of social reform-whether it be social security, health and unemployment insurance, a guaranteed minimum family income, occupational safety, or improved and extended public education. -->\n<br />\nWhen it comes to the principled defense of freedom, and to opposition to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a free society has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.\n<br /><br />\nI want to conclude with a few remarks about the domestic scene and the role of Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.\n<br /><br />\nWe are few in number and limited in influence. So was the Fabian Society of Great Britain. But in time it reeducated a great political party and much of the nation. We must try to do the same.</blockquote>\n\n=== Penn Kemble ===\n[[Penn Kemble]] was an American [[political activist]] and a founding member of SDUSA.

Addressing the allegation that SDUSUA was a \"Trotskyist\" organization, Muravchik wrote that in the early 1960s, two future members of SDUSA, [[Tom Kahn]] and [[Paul Feldman]]: <blockquote>\"became devotees of a former Trotskyist named Max Shachtman\u2014a fact that today has taken on a life of its own. Tracing forward in lineage through me and a few other ex-YPSL's [members of the [[Young Peoples Socialist League]]] turned neoconservatives, this happenstance has fueled the accusation that neoconservatism itself, and through it the foreign policy of the Bush administration, are somehow rooted in 'Trotskyism.'\n\nI am more inclined to laugh than to cry over this, but since the myth has traveled so far, let me briefly try once more, as I have done at greater length in the past, to set the record straight.[See \"The Neoconservative Cabal,\" ''Commentary'', September 2003] The alleged connective chain is broken at every link. The falsity of its more recent elements is readily ascertainable by anyone who cares for the truth\u2014namely, that George Bush was never a neoconservative and that most neoconservatives were never YPSL's. The earlier connections are more obscure but no less false. Although Shachtman was one of the elder statesmen who occasionally made stirring speeches to us, no YPSL of my generation was a Shachtmanite. What is more, our mentors, Paul and Tom, had come under Shachtman\u2019s sway years after he himself had ceased to be a Trotskyite.</blockquote></ref> because of his criticism of the Soviet Union as being a totalitarian class-society after having supported Trotsky in the 1930s.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/savingremnantrad00dube/page/84 <!-- quote=shachtman, realignment. --> Martin Duberman, A Saving Remnant: The Radical Lives of Barbara Deming and David McReynolds (The New Press, 2013)]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/otheramericanlif0000isse/page/300 <!-- quote=shachtman, meany. --> Maurice Isserman, The Other American: The Life Of Michael Harrington (Public Affairs, 2001), p. 290\u2013304]</ref> Although Schachtman died in 1972 before the Socialist Party was renamed as SDUSA, Shachtman's ideas continued to influence the Albert Shanker and The American Federation of Teachers, which was often associated with SDUSA members.

The [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) had stopped running independent presidential candidates and consequently the term party in the SPA's name had confused the public. Replacing Socialist with Social Democrats, SDUSA clarified its vision to Americans who confused social democracy with the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] which SDUSA opposes.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html?_r=0|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn response, former SPA Co-Chairman [[Michael Harrington]] resigned from SDUSA in 1973 and founded the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) which criticized SDUSA's [[anti-communism]] and welcomed the [[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics movement]] associated with [[George McGovern]] and the [[New Left]].<ref name=\"Bloodworth147\">{{harvtxt|Bloodworth|2013|p=147}}</ref> SDUSA members opposed McGovern's politics and a few of them helped to start the [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]] and such members have been called [[Henry M. Jackson|Scoop Jackson]] Democrats or [[neoconservatives]], or both. SDUSA's members had been active in the [[civil rights movement]] which had been led since the 1940s by [[A. Philip Randolph]]. SDUSA's leaders had organized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], during which [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivered his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. Under the leadership of Randolph and [[Bayard Rustin]], SDUSA championed Rustin's [[Bayard Rustin#From Protest to Politics|emphasis on economic inequality]] as the most important issue facing African Americans after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. SDUSA's efforts to reduce [[Economic inequality in the United States|economic inequality]] led to a focus on labor unions and economic policy. As a result, SDUSA members were active in the [[AFL\u2013CIO]] confederation as well as in individual unions, especially the [[American Federation of Teachers]].\n\nSDUSA's electoral strategy of [[political realignment]] intended to organize labor unions, civil rights organizations and other constituencies into a coalition that would transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party. The realignment strategy emphasized working with unions and especially the AFL\u2013CIO, putting an emphasis on economic issues that would unite working class voters. SDUSA opposed the New Politics of Senator McGovern which had lost all states other than Massachusetts to [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], when Americans voted for a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1972 United States House of Representatives elections|House elections]]. While SDUSA had endorsed McGovern, it had adopted resolutions criticizing the New Politics for having made criticisms of [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] and [[Working class in the United States|working class]] Americans and for its advocacy of an immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\nSDUSA's organizational activities included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers\u2014it was known mainly because of its members' activities in other organizations. It included civil rights activists and leaders of labor unions such as Bayard Rustin, [[Norman Hill]] and [[Tom Kahn]] of the AFL\u2013CIO as well as [[Sandra Feldman]] and [[Rachelle Horowitz]] of the AFT. Kahn organized the AFL\u2013CIO's support of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], an [[Independent union|independent labor union]] that challenged the [[Polish People's Republic]].<ref name=\"Shevis32\">{{harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=32}}</ref> [[Penn Kemble]] and [[Carl Gershman]] cooperated with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administrations on [[democracy promotion]], beginning with the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. Other members included the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher [[Sidney Hook]]. SDUSA ceased operations in 2005 following the death of Penn Kemble. In 2008\u20132009, two small organizations emerged, each proclaiming itself to be the successor to SDUSA.\n\nSDUSA's politics were criticized by former SPA Chairman [[Michael Harrington]], who in 1972 announced that he favored an immediate pull-out of American forces from Vietnam (without requiring any guarantees). After losing all votes at the 1972 convention that changed the SPA to SDUSA, Harrington resigned in 1973 and formed his [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) which welcomed the New Politics and middle-class leadership.<ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/><ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\">\"The new strata of the issue-oriented and college-educated who provided the mass bass for [the McGovern Campaign] were, and are, extremely important to the creation of a new majority for change in this country.\"Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> The name change and the formation of DSOC represented a split with the [[socialist movement in the United States]].

Even before the 1972 convention, Harrington had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the SPA<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> \"because he was upset about the group\u2019s failure to enthusiastically support [[George McGovern]] and because of its views on the [[Vietnam War]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GZM2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=social+democrats+usa&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TgNWVceQPO3hsAT5n4CICA&ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=social%20democrats%20usa&f=false Richard D.

''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored [[Darlington Hoopes]] as [[1956 United States presidential election|candidate for President in 1956]] and who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the SPA no longer sponsored party candidates in elections, continued use of the name \"party\" was \"misleading\" and hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party according to the majority report. The name \"Socialist\" was replaced by \"Social Democrats\" because many American associated the term \"[[Democratic socialism|socialism]]\" with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Moreover, the organization sought to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].<ref name=\"NYT27\">{{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=7&st=p}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1972 Convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one.

On foreign policy, the program called for \"firmness toward Communist aggression\". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed \"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect communist political cadres in [[South Vietnam]] from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for a [[ceasefire]] and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|immediate withdrawal]] of American forces was defeated.<!-- A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), [[Carl Gershman]] introduced the international program that was approved. --><ref name=\"NYT73\"/> Harrington complained that after its convention the SPA had endorsed [[George McGovern]] only with a statement loaded with \"constructive criticism\" and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern.

The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin's article \"From Protest to Politics\" in which Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. The needs of the black community demanded a shift in political strategy, where blacks would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like) to pursue a common economic agenda.

SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated role of middle-class [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace activists]] in the Democratic Party, particularly associated with the \"New Politics\" of Senator [[George McGovern]], whose [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|presidential candidacy]] was viewed as an ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the United States.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/> In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.<ref name=\"NYT74\"/>\n\nIn foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing]] of [[North Vietnam]].

Members of SDUSA have served as officers for governmental, private and not-for-profit organizations. [[A.&nbsp;Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Norman Hill]] were leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]. [[Tom Kahn]], [[Sandra Feldman]] and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and [[Penn Kemble]] served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] was a [[public intellectual]]. Writing after the death of [[Tom Kahn]], [[Ben Wattenberg]] commented that SDUSA as an \"umbrella organization\" associated with other [[letterhead organization]]s, saying the following: <blockquote>[SDUSA members seemed to be] ingeniously trying to bury the Soviet Union in a blizzard of letterheads. It seemed that each of Tom's colleagues\u2014Penn Kemble, Carl Gershman, Josh Muravchik and many more\u2014ran a little organization, each with the same interlocking directorate listed on the stationery. Funny thing: The Letterhead Lieutenants did indeed churn up a blizzard, and the Soviet Union is no more.\n\nI never did quite get all the organizational acronyms straight\u2014YPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISL\u2014but the key words were \"democratic\", \"labor\", \"young\" and, until events redefined it away from their understanding, \"socialist\". Ultimately, the umbrella group became \"Social Democrats, U.S.A\", and Tom Kahn was a principal \"theoretician\".\n\nThey talked and wrote endlessly, mostly about communism and democracy, despising the former, adoring the latter. It is easy today to say \"anti-communist\" and \"pro-democracy\" in the same breath. But that is because American foreign policy eventually became just such a mixture, thanks in part to those \"Yipsels\" (Young People's Socialist League), with Tom Kahn as provocateur-at-large.\n\nOn the conservative side, foreign policy used to be anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but nervous about being anti-communist. Tom theorized that to be either, you had to be both.\n\nIt was tough for labor-liberal intellectuals to be \"anti-communist\" in the 1970s. It meant being taunted as \"Cold Warriors\" who saw \"Commies under every bed\" and being labeled as\u2014the unkindest cut\u2014\"right-wingers\".<ref name=\"Wattenberg\">{{cite news|date=April 22, 1992|first=Ben|last=Wattenberg|authorlink=Ben Wattenberg|title=A man whose ideas helped change the world|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 November 2011|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-04-22/news/1992113044_1_tom-kahn-foreign-policy-anti-communist|id=Syndicated: (Thursday April 23, 1993). \"[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110504812 Remembering a man who mattered]\".

Philip Randolph came to national attention as the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]. Randolph proposed a march on Washington, D.C. to protest racial discrimination in the United States armed forces. Meeting with [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[Oval Office]], Randolph respectfully, politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that blacks would march in the capital unless desegregation would occur. The planned march was canceled after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the [[Fair Employment Act]]), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.\n\nIn 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]] to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, in war industries, in government agencies and in labor unions.&nbsp;Following the act, during the [[Philadelphia Transit Strike]] of 1944 the government backed African American workers' striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.\n\nIn 1947, Randolph, along with colleague [[Grant Reynolds (civil rights leader)|Grant Reynolds]], renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]].&nbsp; On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S.

This article stated that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. To pursue its economic agenda, the black community needed to shift political strategy, strengthening its political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like).

Philip Randolph Institute, 1970</ref>\n\n===== Influence on William Julius Wilson =====\nRustin's analysis was supported by the later research by [[William Julius Wilson]].<ref name=\"RKRustin\"/> Wilson documented an increase in inequality within the black community, following educated blacks moving into white suburbs and following the decrease of demand for low-skill labor as industry declined in the Northern United States. Such economic problems were not being addressed by a civil rights leadership focused on \"[[affirmative action]]\", a policy benefiting the truly advantaged within the black community. Wilson's criticism of the neglect of working class and poor African Americans by civil rights organizations led to his being mistaken for a conservative, despite his having identified himself as a Rustin-style social democrat. Wilson has served on the advisory board of Social Democrats, USA.<ref>Wilson's ''The Declining Significance of Race'' won the [[American Sociological Association]]'s [[Sydney Spivack Award]]. In ''The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions'' (1978), [[Split labor market theory|Wilson]] argues that the significance of race is waning, and an African-American's class is comparatively more important in determining his or her life chances. His ''The Truly Disadvantaged'', which was selected by the editors of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received ''The Washington Monthly'' Annual Book Award and the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award. In ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy'' (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the \"[[spatial mismatch]]\" theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global [[economic restructuring]], and hence urban [[unemployment]] increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children, since the fathers would not be breadwinners. His ''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'', which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of ''The New York Times Book Review'' and received the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award. His ''The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics'' reaffirms the need for a coalition strategy, as Rustin suggested. In Wilson's most recent book, ''More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City'' (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans. He asks the question, \"Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?\" In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education. Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers. In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors. He tries \"to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture, but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality.\" Wilson's goal is to \"rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena\" ([http://www.prrac.org/pdf/WJWMayJune2009PRRAC.pdf PDF]).</ref>\n\n==== Labor movement, trade unions and social democracy ====\nRustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the [[African American]] community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social democratic politics.\n\nHe was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL\u2013CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL\u2013CIO newspaper.\n\nOn the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]].

It is an obligation from which we could not shrink without doing damage to the ''raison d'etre'' of the American labor movement itself. Discharging this obligation entails risks, of course, but it is up to Solidarity, the ones on the front line, who know better than we the opportunities and dangers before them, to define the aid they need.

To ensure repayment, the international banking community has in the past pressured the Polish government into policies<ref name=\"Kahn 2008 234\"/> of austerity, which have been borne by the workers by higher prices and longer work weeks.

Its support worried the Carter administration, whose Secretary of State [[Edmund Muskie]] told Kirkland that the AFL\u2013CIO's continued support of Solidarity could trigger a Soviet invasion of Poland.<ref>{{harvtxt|Puddington|2008}} wrote:<blockquote>\"Kirkland's embrace of Solidarity brought him into immediate conflict with the Carter administration. Despite the administration's avowed commitment to human rights, Edmund Muskie, secretary of state, decided that quiet diplomacy was the most prudent course to follow in the Polish crisis. He summoned Kirkland to his office for lunch on September 3, 1980, during which he gave a 'negative assessment' of the Polish aid fund that the AFL-CIO had just launched and declared that the federation's open support for Solidarity could be 'deliberately misinterpreted' by the Kremlin in order to justify military intervention. Muskie was not alone in deploring labor's Polish initiative. In a ''New&nbsp;York Times'' column, Flora Lewis called the Workers&nbsp;Aid Fund 'most unfortunate.'

During her early years in the civil rights movement, Feldman worked to integrate [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants in [[Maryland]]. She soon became employment committee chairwoman of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] in [[Harlem]]. She also participated in several [[Freedom Rides]] and was arrested twice.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== Teaching ====\nUpon graduation from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1962, Feldman worked for six months as a substitute third-grade teacher in [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]]. She continued to be active in the civil rights movement, working to desegregate Howard Johnson restaurants in Maryland.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> She participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a [[master's degree]] program in literature at [[New York University]]. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]], which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won [[collective bargaining]] rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> During this time, Feldman became an associate of [[Albert Shanker]], then an organizer for the [[United Federation of Teachers]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== United Federation of Teachers ====\n{{see also|Albert Shanker|American Federation of Teachers}}\nIn 1966, Shanker\u2014now executive director of the UFT\u2014hired Feldman as a full-time field representative on the recommendation of Rustin. Over the next nine years, Feldman became the union's executive director and oversaw its staff. She was elected its secretary (the second-most powerful position in the local) in 1983.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter just two years on the UFT staff, Feldman played a crucial role in the [[American Federation of Teachers#Ocean Hill\u2013Brownsville strike|Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike]]. The city of New York had designated the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts in an effort to give the minority community more say in school affairs.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> The crisis began when the Ocean Hill-Brownsville governing board fired 13 teachers for allegedly sabotaging the decentralization experiment. Shanker demanded that specific charges be filed and the teachers given a chance to defend themselves in [[due process]] proceedings.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nA protracted fight erupted between those in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being \"Jewish-dominated\". Feldman was often at the center of the strike.<ref>Carter, ''Pickets, Parents, and Power,'' 1971.</ref> The UFT emerged from the crisis more powerful than ever and Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> Shanker was elected president of the AFT in 1974, but he retained his post as UFT President. In 1986, Shanker retired as UFT President and Feldman was elected president.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\n==== UFT President after Shanker ====\nFeldman was known for being a quiet yet very effective leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that [[Robert F. Wagner Jr. (deputy mayor)|Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and he was given a free hand.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nShe was instrumental in helping [[David Dinkins]] win election as mayor of New York in 1989 by using union members and resources to build a winning electoral coalition of black and white voters.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> However, once mayor Dinkins stalled on signing a new contract with the teachers' union and Feldman rarely criticized Dinkins publicly for his actions, but she kept the UFT out of Dinkins' 1993 re-election. Dinkins lost in a tight race to [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== American Federation of Teachers ====\nFeldman had been elected an AFT vice president in 1974,<ref>[http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/ward/aft/people.html See the list of AFT vice presidents at]</ref> serving on the national union's executive council and the executive council's executive committee.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won election as the AFT President in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew by more than 160,000 new members (about 17 percent). With Feldman as President, in 2002 AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a \"culture of organizing\" throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging in a series of publicity, legislative, funding and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work; and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nIn May 1997, Feldman was elected to the AFL\u2013CIO executive council and appointed to the executive council's executive committee. During her tenure at the head of the AFT, Feldman also served as a vice president of [[Education International]] and was a board member of the [[International Rescue Committee]] and [[Freedom House]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nFeldman died in 2005 at the age 65.<ref name=\"Feldman\">\n* ''Almanac of Famous People.'' 88th ed.

It is democracy as a way of life. What is \"democracy as a way of life.\" It is a society whose basic institutions are animated by an equality of concern for all human beings, regardless of class, race, sex, religion, and national origin, to develop themselves as persons to their fullest growth, to be free to live up to their desirable potentials as human beings. It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected.\n<!-- The Social Democrat therefore is interested in extending the area of equal opportunity beyond the political sphere to all other areas of social life. He believes that all social institutions to the extent to which they are modifiable must be judged by their, fruits or consequences an the lives of individual persons. It is from this premise of \"democracy as a way of life,\" of equal opportunity for all to develop themselves as persons, taken as a regulative moral ideal, not as an inexorable, \"dialectical\" law of history, that the social democrat derives the justification for multiple programs of social reform-whether it be social security, health and unemployment insurance, a guaranteed minimum family income, occupational safety, or improved and extended public education. -->\n<br />\nWhen it comes to the principled defense of freedom, and to opposition to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a free society has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.\n<br /><br />\nI want to conclude with a few remarks about the domestic scene and the role of Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.\n<br /><br />\nWe are few in number and limited in influence. So was the Fabian Society of Great Britain. But in time it reeducated a great political party and much of the nation. We must try to do the same.</blockquote>\n\n=== Penn Kemble ===\n[[Penn Kemble]] was an American [[political activist]] and a founding member of SDUSA.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and a [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans. Square subsequently stated that it would never allow Sony to localize the game in any way.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Colin|last=Campbell|title=Final Fantasy Mania |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997|page=30}}</ref> In addition to translating the text, the North American localization team made tweaks to the gameplay, including reducing the enemy encounter rate, simplifying the Materia menu, and adding new boss fights.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Bro Buzz|title=Final Fantasy VII Update! |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=107|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=August 1997|page=86}}</ref>\n\n===Later releases===\nThe ''International'' version of ''Final Fantasy VII'' was released on [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) as a PSOne Classic in Japan on April 10, 2009.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an ongoing [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including ''Final Fantasy VI'' had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems.

The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office.

A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

He starred in some of the  [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' most popular live-action pictures of that period, such as ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949), and ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1950). He served as animation model and provided the voice for the title role in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953). In 1950, he received an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for outstanding performance in feature films of 1949, for his roles in ''So Dear to My Heart'' and ''[[The Window (1949 film)|The Window]]'', both released in 1949.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Driscoll's acting career began to decline, and he turned primarily to guest appearances on [[Anthology series#Television|anthology TV series]]. He became addicted to [[narcotics]] and was sentenced to prison for illicit drug use. After his release, he focused his attention on the [[avant-garde]] art scene. In ill health due to his [[substance abuse]], and with his funds depleted, he died in 1968 in an abandoned building, shortly after his 31st birthday.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born Robert Cletus Driscoll in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], the only child of Cletus (1901\u20131969), an insulation salesman, and Isabelle ([[n\u00e9e]] Kratz; 1904\u20131981), a former schoolteacher.

The family moved to [[Los Angeles]] when a doctor advised the father to relocate to California because he was suffering from work-related handling of [[asbestos]].\n\nDriscoll's parents were encouraged to get Bobby into films. Their barber's son, an actor, got Bobby an audition at [[MGM]] for a big role in the 1943 family drama ''[[Lost Angel (film)|Lost Angel]]'', which starred [[Margaret O'Brien]]. While on a tour across the studio lot, five-year-old Driscoll noticed a mock-up ship and asked where the water was.

Among breeding seals, a lack of fighting for a mate seems prevalent. In late autumn, Caspian seals travel to the northern part of the Caspian Sea where the water is shallow and frozen to give birth in secluded areas on ice sheets after a gestation period of 11 months.  Normally, pregnancy rates are  40 to 70%, but are currently at an all-time low of 30%.  In late January to early February, female seals give birth to one pup each. Similar to other ringed seals, these pups are born with white [[pelage]]s and weigh about 5&nbsp;kg. Their white coats are [[molt]]ed at around three weeks to a month.  Male pups become sexually mature after six to seven years, whereas female pups sexually mature after five to seven years.

This resort development can be a serious disturbance for seals. The local authorities have been advised about the need to preserve the seal habitats in the bay, but it is not yet clear what steps are planned to achieve this. According to the present study, Kosa Kenderli plays an important role for the seasonal migration of the Caspian seals and is recommended to be a protection area.\n\nDue to increased industrial production in the area, pollution has had an effect on the survival of the Caspian seal. From 1998 to 2000, the concentration of zinc and iron increased dramatically in the tissue of dead, diseased seals.

Necropsies performed in June 2000 on eight Azerbaijan seals revealed microscopic lesions, including bronchointerstitial pneumonia, encephalitis, pancreatitis, and lymphocytic depletion in lymphoid tissues.  Similar lesions were also discovered on four seals from Kazakhstan.  ''Morbillivirus'' antigen was also detected in multiple tissues, including lung, lymph nodes, spleen, brain pancreas, liver, and epithelial tissue of the reproductive, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts.  Such tissue lesions are characteristic of distemper in both terrestrial and aquatic mammals.<ref name=mass />\n\nTissues from 12 carcasses found in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan were examined for morbillivirus nucleic acid.  Sequences from the examination showed that canine distemper virus, which is part of the genus ''Morbillivirus'', was the primary cause of death.  The sequences also proved that seals from widely separated regions of the Caspian Sea were infected by the same virus.  This finding established spatial and temporal links between the seal deaths in these regions.  The sequences were also identical to that of canine distemper virus found in the brain tissue of a seal that died in 1997 and showed no morbillivirus lesions.  This suggests persistence of canine distemper virus in the Caspian seal population over a span of several years or repeated spillover from the same terrestrial reservoir.<ref name=mass />\n\nAnother study in 2000 using 18 Caspian seal corpses found several concurrent bacterial infections that could have contributed to the illness of the affected seals.

During the summer, in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, they eat herring, roach, carp, sprat, and smelt. When Caspian seals live in estuaries, they eat large amounts of the freshwater species, ''Sander lucioperca''. Other prey include shrimp, crab, and silversides.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grimeks|first1=B|title=Grimeks Encyclopedia of Mammals|date=1990|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New Jersey|pages=220\u2013238|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\nBeing one of the top predators in the ecosystem, Caspian seals had hazardous chemicals found inside their bodies such as heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, and radionuclides.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ikemoto|first1=T|last2=Kunito|first2=T|last3=Watanabe|first3=I|last4=Yasunaga|first4=G|last5=Baba|first5=N|last6=Miyazaki|first6=N|last7=Petrov|first7=E.

At other times of the year, these seals are solitary. During the summer, however, they make aggressive snorts or use flipper waving to tell other seals to keep their distance. Little else is known about their behavior.<ref name=\"Chanticlear Press\"/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nMale and female Caspian seals are monogamous. Among breeding seals, a lack of fighting for a mate seems prevalent. In late autumn, Caspian seals travel to the northern part of the Caspian Sea where the water is shallow and frozen to give birth in secluded areas on ice sheets after a gestation period of 11 months.  Normally, pregnancy rates are  40 to 70%, but are currently at an all-time low of 30%.  In late January to early February, female seals give birth to one pup each. Similar to other ringed seals, these pups are born with white [[pelage]]s and weigh about 5&nbsp;kg. Their white coats are [[molt]]ed at around three weeks to a month.  Male pups become sexually mature after six to seven years, whereas female pups sexually mature after five to seven years. Newborn pups are not fully grown until 8 to 10 years after they are born.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Easley-Appleyard|first1=Bonnie|title=Pusa Caspica Caspian Seal|journal=Animal Diversity Web|date=2006|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Pusa_caspica/#757c91a32120facf8ff6bc9e83c87ac3|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> Breeding begins a few weeks after the birth of last year's pup around late February to mid March. Breeding usually occurs after weaning of a newborn pup, but can begin while the pup is still nursing.  Caspian seals migrate back to the southern part of the Caspian Sea after the breeding season and molting in late April because the north begins to warm with constant ice melting.  The southern region of the Caspian Sea has deep, colder waters where the seals spend the summer months.<ref>{{cite journal|editor1-last=Hogan|editor1-first=Michael C|title=Caspian Seal|journal=The Encyclopedia of Earth|date=22 July 2010|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/150951/|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Threats==\n{{POV-section|date=January 2020}}\n[[Sea eagle (bird)|Sea eagles]] are known to hunt these seals, which results in a high number of fatalities for the juveniles.

This resort development can be a serious disturbance for seals. The local authorities have been advised about the need to preserve the seal habitats in the bay, but it is not yet clear what steps are planned to achieve this. According to the present study, Kosa Kenderli plays an important role for the seasonal migration of the Caspian seals and is recommended to be a protection area.\n\nDue to increased industrial production in the area, pollution has had an effect on the survival of the Caspian seal. From 1998 to 2000, the concentration of zinc and iron increased dramatically in the tissue of dead, diseased seals. This suggests these elements are causative agents in compromising the Caspian seal's immune system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Anan|first1=Y.|last2=Kunito|first2=T.|last3=Ikemoto|first3=T.|last4=Kubota|first4=R.|last5=Watanabe|first5=I.|last6=Tanabe|first6=S.|last7=Miyazaki|first7=N.|last8=Petrov|first8=E.A.|title=Elevated Concentrations of Trace Elements in Caspian Seals (''Phoca caspica'') Found Stranded During the Mass Mortality Events in 2000|journal=Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology|date=March 2002|volume= 42|issue= 3|pages=354\u2013362|doi=10.1007/s00244-001-0004-7|pmid=11910465}}</ref>\n\nA century ago, their population was estimated at 1.5 million seals; in 2005, 104,000 remained, with an ongoing decline of 3\u20134% per year.<ref name=assessment>{{cite journal|last1=Dmitrieva|first1=Lilia|last2=Kondakov|first2=Andrey|last3=Oleynikov|first3=Eugeny|last4=Kydyrmanov|first4=Aidyn|last5=Karamendin|first5=Kobey|last6=Kasimbekov|first6=Yesbol|last7=Baimunkanov|first7=Mirgaliy|last8=Wilson|first8=Susan|last9=Goodman|first9=Simon|title=Assessment of Caspian Seal By-Catch in an Illegal Fishery Using an Interview-Based Approach|journal=PLoS ONE|date=26 June 2013|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e67074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067074|pmid=23840590|pmc=3694144|bibcode=2013PLoSO...867074D}}</ref>\n\n===Canine distemper virus===\nSeveral recent cases of large numbers of Caspian seals dying due to [[canine distemper]] virus have been reported, in 1997, 2000, and 2001.<ref name=role /> In April 2000, a mass die-off of Caspian seals was first reported near the mouth of the Ural River in Kazakhstan.

Necropsies performed in June 2000 on eight Azerbaijan seals revealed microscopic lesions, including bronchointerstitial pneumonia, encephalitis, pancreatitis, and lymphocytic depletion in lymphoid tissues.  Similar lesions were also discovered on four seals from Kazakhstan.  ''Morbillivirus'' antigen was also detected in multiple tissues, including lung, lymph nodes, spleen, brain pancreas, liver, and epithelial tissue of the reproductive, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts.  Such tissue lesions are characteristic of distemper in both terrestrial and aquatic mammals.<ref name=mass />\n\nTissues from 12 carcasses found in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan were examined for morbillivirus nucleic acid.  Sequences from the examination showed that canine distemper virus, which is part of the genus ''Morbillivirus'', was the primary cause of death.  The sequences also proved that seals from widely separated regions of the Caspian Sea were infected by the same virus.  This finding established spatial and temporal links between the seal deaths in these regions.  The sequences were also identical to that of canine distemper virus found in the brain tissue of a seal that died in 1997 and showed no morbillivirus lesions.  This suggests persistence of canine distemper virus in the Caspian seal population over a span of several years or repeated spillover from the same terrestrial reservoir.<ref name=mass />\n\nAnother study in 2000 using 18 Caspian seal corpses found several concurrent bacterial infections that could have contributed to the illness of the affected seals.  These include ''Bordetella bronchiseptica'', ''Streptococcus phocae'', ''Salmonella dublin'', and ''S. choleraesuis''.  ''Corynebacterium caspium'', a new bacterium, was identified in one of the seals, and poxvirus, ''Atopobacter phocae'', ''Eimeria''- and ''Sarcocystis''-like organisms, and a ''Halarachne'' species were identified in Caspian seals for the first time.  The study also asserts that the \u201cunusually mild\u201d winter that preceded the die-off in 2000 could have contributed to its cause \u201cthrough increased ambient air pressure and accelerated disappearance of ice cover at the breeding areas in the northern Caspian Sea.\u201d<ref name=canine>{{cite journal|last1=Kuiken|first1=T.|last2=Kennedy|first2=S.|last3=Barrett|first3=T.|last4=Van de Bilt|first4=M.W.G.|last5=Borgsteede|first5=F.H.|last6=Brew|first6=S.D.|last7=Codd|first7=G.A.|last8=Duck|first8=C.|last9=Deaville|first9=R.|last10=Eybatov|first10=T.|last11=Forsyth|first11=M.A.|last12=Foster|first12=G.|last13=Jepson|first13=P.D.|last14=Kydyrmanov|first14=A.|last15=Mitrofanov|first15=I.|last16=Ward|first16=C.J.|last17=Wilson|first17=S.|last18=Osterhaus|first18=A.D.M.E.|title=The 2000 Canine Distemper Epidemic in Caspian Seals (''Phoca caspica''): Pathology and Analysis of Contributory Factors|journal=Veterinary Pathology|date=1 May 2006|volume=43|issue=3|pages=321\u2013338|pmid=16672579|doi=10.1354/vp.43-3-321|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mammals}}\n*[[Tyuleniy Archipelago (Kazakhstan)|Tyuleniy Archipelago]] and [[Tyuleny Island (Caspian Sea)|Tyuleny Island]], both named after the Caspian seals\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*[http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/mat/ekolo/vk/palo/geneticd.pdf Jukka Palo: Genetic diversity and phylogeography of landlocked seals]\n*[http://seamap.env.duke.edu/species/tsn/622019 OBIS-SEAMAP - Species Profiles]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Phoca caspica|Caspian seal}}\n{{Wikispecies|Phoca caspica|Caspian seal}}\n*[http://www.pinnipeds.org/seal-information/species-information-pages/the-phocid-seals/caspian-seal Caspian seal factsheet at pinnipeds.org]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302090217/http://www.baztab.ir/news/61696.php \"Caspian Seal under threat of extinction\"], [[Baztab]] newspaper.

Although [[Sid Meier]] created the original ''[[Railroad Tycoon (series)|Railroad Tycoon]]'', subsequent versions were developed by [[PopTop Software]]. ''Railroads!'' was the first game in the series since the original to have direct input from Sid Meier himself. After a visit to [[Miniatur Wunderland]] in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], [[Germany]], Meier was inspired to reinvent his original creation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JjVsBQVK2A | title=Interview with Sid Meier | format=Video | publisher=[[YouTube]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref> A version for the [[Mac OS|Mac]] [[OS X]] was published by [[Feral Interactive]] on November 1, 2012, under the latter's Feral Legends label.<ref name=\"feralinteractive.com\"/>\n\n==Overview==\n''Railroads!'' is fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] and geared more toward head-to-head [[real-time strategy]] than the previous versions,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firaxis.com/?/about | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[Firaxis Games]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2015-06-05}}</ref> resulting in it being less suited to single player play, and a less realistic simulation of railway operation.  The terrain is more compressed in this game; there are few areas where players are allowed a long, straight run of track without earthworks or a bridge, meaning that terrain (such as hills, mountains, rivers and inlets) plays a more important role, at least in the early stages of a game.\n\nThe game is heavily focused on [[economics]] \u2013 players have to build and sustain entire [[industries]] using the railroads they develop. Gameplay changes from previous editions of ''Railroad Tycoon'' include a system where new technology is first [[auction]]ed to the highest bidder.  This gives the player a ten-year exclusive use of that technology. Similarly, individual industries are also put up for auction amongst players.<ref name=\"gamespot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/sid-meiers-railroads/ | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=2006 | accessdate=2015-06-05 }}</ref> However, the game does not have the dynamic pricing of goods across the entire map or cargo that can find alternate means of transportation if no train service is provided that were features of Railroad Tycoon III, and other simplifications compared to previous Railroad Tycoon games are that there is no separation of individual money from company money, nor the ability to raise money on an in-game bond market.   Tracklaying is automated and much easier than other editions of ''Railroad Tycoon''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/724/724674p1.html | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=IGN | year=2006 }}</ref> When combined with the more \"compressed\" terrain, it allows for tactical placement of track to obstruct and frustrate opponents.  However, players are limited to laying track in a contiguous system, which in turn reduces the impact of there being no network effects in the economics of the game.  Another limitation is that trains do not keep to the right on a stretch of double track, meaning unrealistic blocking of the track by one's own trains is common if more than one train is allowed on a stretch of track.\n\nIndustries vary depending on the location and timeframe.

Although [[Sid Meier]] created the original ''[[Railroad Tycoon (series)|Railroad Tycoon]]'', subsequent versions were developed by [[PopTop Software]]. ''Railroads!'' was the first game in the series since the original to have direct input from Sid Meier himself. After a visit to [[Miniatur Wunderland]] in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], [[Germany]], Meier was inspired to reinvent his original creation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JjVsBQVK2A | title=Interview with Sid Meier | format=Video | publisher=[[YouTube]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref> A version for the [[Mac OS|Mac]] [[OS X]] was published by [[Feral Interactive]] on November 1, 2012, under the latter's Feral Legends label.<ref name=\"feralinteractive.com\"/>\n\n==Overview==\n''Railroads!'' is fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] and geared more toward head-to-head [[real-time strategy]] than the previous versions,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firaxis.com/?/about | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[Firaxis Games]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2015-06-05}}</ref> resulting in it being less suited to single player play, and a less realistic simulation of railway operation.  The terrain is more compressed in this game; there are few areas where players are allowed a long, straight run of track without earthworks or a bridge, meaning that terrain (such as hills, mountains, rivers and inlets) plays a more important role, at least in the early stages of a game.\n\nThe game is heavily focused on [[economics]] \u2013 players have to build and sustain entire [[industries]] using the railroads they develop. Gameplay changes from previous editions of ''Railroad Tycoon'' include a system where new technology is first [[auction]]ed to the highest bidder.  This gives the player a ten-year exclusive use of that technology. Similarly, individual industries are also put up for auction amongst players.<ref name=\"gamespot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/sid-meiers-railroads/ | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=2006 | accessdate=2015-06-05 }}</ref> However, the game does not have the dynamic pricing of goods across the entire map or cargo that can find alternate means of transportation if no train service is provided that were features of Railroad Tycoon III, and other simplifications compared to previous Railroad Tycoon games are that there is no separation of individual money from company money, nor the ability to raise money on an in-game bond market.   Tracklaying is automated and much easier than other editions of ''Railroad Tycoon''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/724/724674p1.html | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=IGN | year=2006 }}</ref> When combined with the more \"compressed\" terrain, it allows for tactical placement of track to obstruct and frustrate opponents.  However, players are limited to laying track in a contiguous system, which in turn reduces the impact of there being no network effects in the economics of the game.  Another limitation is that trains do not keep to the right on a stretch of double track, meaning unrealistic blocking of the track by one's own trains is common if more than one train is allowed on a stretch of track.\n\nIndustries vary depending on the location and timeframe. European scenarios include Wine, Beer, and Dairy Products while Western United States scenarios focus on [[Petroleum|Oil]] and Gold.\n\nThe game also allows head-to-head play over a [[Local Area Network|LAN]], and prior to 2013 when GameSpy ceased online hosting services for multiplayer games, the [[Internet]], supporting up to four players per game, either human or [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"gameinformer\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/2E1C4B8D-B401-4B7E-998B-9E8F6388B54F.htm | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[Game Informer]] | date=2006 | accessdate=2006-10-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018173510/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/2E1C4B8D-B401-4B7E-998B-9E8F6388B54F.htm |archivedate = October 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Scenarios==\n\nLike the previous versions, ''Railroads!'' offers various historical scenarios, in regions such as the [[Southwestern United States]], the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Germany]].

The Fields were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was built in 220 BC. The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted annually in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields.

The Fields were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was built in 220 BC. The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted annually in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]].
