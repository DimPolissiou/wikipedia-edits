But in 1972, the [[Prior]] of the Grande Chartreuse denied that the monastery's archives held any records of the monks' use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux ([[#Simonnet 1990|Simonnet 1990]]:36\u201337). \n\nLegend also has it that the Chartreux's ancestors were feral mountain cats from what is now [[Syria]], brought back to France by returning [[Crusade]]rs in the 13th century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order.\n\nThe first documented mention of the breed was by the French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] in the 18th century. The breed was greatly diminished during the first World War and wild populations ([[#Helgren 2013|Helgren 2013]]:100-103) were not seen after World War II. A concerted effort by European breeders kept the breed from extinction. The first Chartreux were brought to the [[United States|U.S.]] in 1971 by Helen and John Gamon of La Jolla, California. In 1987, the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) advanced the Chartreux breed to championship status ([[#Siegal 1997|Siegal 1997]]:27). There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux breeders in North America {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.\n\nHistorically, famous Chartreux owners include the French novelist [[Colette]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and the French president [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\n==Temperament==\nChartreux cats tend to be quiet, rarely making noises such as mewing or crying, and some are mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with some Chartreux learning to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. Chartreux cats are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch small objects in the same manner as a dog. Chartreux are good with children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good travelers and generally very healthy.  Chartreux tend to bond with one person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe mascot of the world's largest [[jazz]] festival, the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], is a blue Chartreux affectionately named 'Ste Cat [http://blog.montrealjazzfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/chat1.jpg]', after the festival's hub, [[Sainte Catherine Street]] in Montreal. <!-- Previous MJF jpg was 404; replaced with this one. -->\n\nGris-Gris, [[Charles De Gaulle]]'s cat, followed him from room to room.<!--\u2191 100 chats de l\u00e9gende, op. cit., \u00ab L'\u00e9minence grise du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb, p. 61--><ref> {{Cite book|last=Kaymak|first=Nuesret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54WrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq=Gris-Gris+chartreux&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN0O2cspLoAhUUHDQIHYq2AuQQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=Gris-Gris%20chartreux&f=false|title=All Cat Breeds of This World: All Approved Cat Breeds|publisher=Atelier Kaymak UG|isbn=978-3-96183-036-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrench writer [[Colette]] made one of her Chartreux the heroine of her books \"[[La Chatte]]\" and \"Les Vrilles de la Vigne.\"\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n===Literature ===\n<span id=\"Fogle_2001\">[[Bruce Fogle|Fogle, Bruce]] (2001).

There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux breeders in North America {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.\n\nHistorically, famous Chartreux owners include the French novelist [[Colette]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and the French president [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\n==Temperament==\nChartreux cats tend to be quiet, rarely making noises such as mewing or crying, and some are mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with some Chartreux learning to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. Chartreux cats are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch small objects in the same manner as a dog. Chartreux are good with children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good travelers and generally very healthy.  Chartreux tend to bond with one person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe mascot of the world's largest [[jazz]] festival, the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], is a blue Chartreux affectionately named 'Ste Cat [http://blog.montrealjazzfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/chat1.jpg]', after the festival's hub, [[Sainte Catherine Street]] in Montreal. <!-- Previous MJF jpg was 404; replaced with this one. -->\n\nGris-Gris, [[Charles De Gaulle]]'s cat, who followed him from room to room.<!--\u2191 100 chats de l\u00e9gende, op. cit., \u00ab L'\u00e9minence grise du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb, p. 61-->{{Full citation needed|date=January 2013}}<ref> https://books.google.com/books?id=54WrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq=Gris-Gris+chartreux&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN0O2cspLoAhUUHDQIHYq2AuQQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=Gris-Gris%20chartreux&f=false</ref>\n\nFrench writer [[Colette]] made one of her Chartreux the heroine of her books \"[[La Chatte]]\" and \"Les Vrilles de la vigne.\"\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n===Literature ===\n<span id=\"Fogle_2001\">[[Bruce Fogle|Fogle, Bruce]] (2001).

It spans from [[New York State Route 25|NY&nbsp;25]] (Jericho Turnpike) in [[Commack, New York|Commack]] to [[New York State Route 27|NY&nbsp;27]] (Sunrise Highway) in [[Holbrook, New York|Holbrook]]. The route provides access to the [[Long Island MacArthur Airport]], as well as New York State and Suffolk County government offices, and at one time the [[Long Island Arena]]. NY&nbsp;454 serves as the northern terminus for the [[Northern State Parkway]] in [[Hauppauge, New York|Hauppauge]], where a concurrency with [[New York State Route 347|NY&nbsp;347]] begins.\n\nThe origins of NY&nbsp;454 dates back to the late 1940s when a new freeway was constructed from [[Commack]] to [[Holbrook,_New_York|Holbrook]] for $1.4&nbsp;million (1949 USD). This new freeway was designated as a memorial for Suffolk County War Veterans. The route was designed and constructed by the [[Suffolk County Department of Public Works]] under watch and aid from the [[New York State Department of Public Works]] and the United States government. Upon completion in January 1950, the route was designated as [[County Route 76 (Suffolk County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;76]] (CR&nbsp;76) west of Town Line Road and [[County Route 78 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;78]] southeast of Town Line Road until 1968 when the entire highway was designated CR&nbsp;78. In 1972, the state took over control of the new highway and designated it NY&nbsp;454. Recently, there have been plans to expand the highway and the [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with Route&nbsp;347 with new travel lanes and a new interchange being built between the two highways.\n\n== Route description ==\n[[File:New York State Route 454 approaching the SM Parkway South.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;454 approaching the Sunken Meadow State Parkway in Commack]]\nNY&nbsp;454 begins at a fork along [[New York State Route 25|NY&nbsp;25]] ([[Jericho Turnpike]]) in [[Commack, New York|Commack]]. The route heads southeastward as the four-lane Veterans Memorial Highway, passing through a large commercial district built up around NY&nbsp;454's interchange with the [[Sunken Meadow State Parkway]] (exit&nbsp;SM2). From there, NY&nbsp;454 continues eastward through a residential district for several miles and passes to the south of Whitman Hollow Park. The arterial continues southeastward through local residential areas with four lanes before meeting [[New York State Route 347|NY&nbsp;347]] and the [[Northern State Parkway]] at an interchange in [[Hauppauge, New York|Hauppauge]]. The junction serves as the western terminus of NY&nbsp;347 and the eastern terminus of the Northern Parkway. NY&nbsp;347 and NY&nbsp;454 [[concurrency (road)|become concurrent]], crossing through Hauppauge and residential properties for the next two miles (3.2&nbsp;km), intersecting with local roads.

After turning further to the south, the highway intersects with [[County Route 67 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;67]], the former alignment of the Long Island Motor Parkway. Here, NY&nbsp;454 returns to four lanes and meets the [[Long Island Expressway]] (Interstate&nbsp;495) and its frontage roads. The route enters the village of [[Islandia, New York|Islandia]] and enters a large commercial district, where the route intersects with [[County Route 100 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;100]] (Old Nichols Road). After crossing the [[Long Island Rail Road]], NY&nbsp;454 enters [[Connetquot River State Park]], bends to the east and traverses the park.

There, the highway passes [[Long Island MacArthur Airport]] and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial for the last two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) of NY&nbsp;454. About three miles (4.8&nbsp;km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY&nbsp;454 connects to the Sunrise Highway ([[New York State Route 27|NY&nbsp;27]]) at exit&nbsp;51, a partial interchange in [[Holbrook, New York|Holbrook]]. Here, the NY&nbsp;454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY&nbsp;27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY&nbsp;454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:New York State Route 454 at the LIE.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;454 in Islip approaching the Long Island Expressway (I-495)]]\nConstruction first began in 1948 for a new freeway from Commack to Holbrook by the [[Suffolk County Department of Public Works]]. The $1.4 million (1949 USD) project was funded by federal aid and was designated as a new memorial for the war veterans. People had been arguing since 1947 to get a new county-funded war veteran memorial installed in Suffolk, including a number of other suggested projects such as trees at a park in [[Yaphank, New York|Yaphank]] to a new general-use hospital. On April&nbsp;30, 1949, the sides came to agreement to name the new highway for the war veterans, and two agencies were hired to come up with a name. The design for the freeway between Commack and Holbrook included a {{convert|145|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], and the road was constructed under the supervision of the [[New York State Department of Public Works]].<ref name=\"open\">{{cite news |title=Road To Be Memorial To Suffolk Veterans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/05/01/archives/road-to-be-memorial-to-suffolk-veterans.html |date=April 30, 1949 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=88 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nConstruction continued throughout 1949, with the new Veterans Memorial Highway opening on January&nbsp;25, 1950.

The new freeway's wide right-of-way was built with room for additional lanes if the situation became necessary.

Here, the NY&nbsp;454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY&nbsp;27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY&nbsp;454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:New York State Route 454 at the LIE.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;454 in Islip approaching the Long Island Expressway (I-495)]]\nConstruction first began in 1948 for a new freeway from Commack to Holbrook by the [[Suffolk County Department of Public Works]]. The $1.4 million (1949 USD) project was funded by federal aid and was designated as a new memorial for the war veterans. People had been arguing since 1947 to get a new county-funded war veteran memorial installed in Suffolk, including a number of other suggested projects such as trees at a park in [[Yaphank, New York|Yaphank]] to a new general-use hospital. On April&nbsp;30, 1949, the sides came to agreement to name the new highway for the war veterans, and two agencies were hired to come up with a name. The design for the freeway between Commack and Holbrook included a {{convert|145|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], and the road was constructed under the supervision of the [[New York State Department of Public Works]].<ref name=\"open\">{{cite news |title=Road To Be Memorial To Suffolk Veterans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/05/01/archives/road-to-be-memorial-to-suffolk-veterans.html |date=April 30, 1949 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=88 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nConstruction continued throughout 1949, with the new Veterans Memorial Highway opening on January&nbsp;25, 1950. The new {{convert|13.62|mi|2|adj=on}} highway was designated as CR&nbsp;76 for {{convert|4.18|mi|2}} through [[Smithtown, New York|Smithtown]] and CR&nbsp;78 for the remaining {{convert|9.44|mi|2}} in the town of [[Islip (town), New York|Islip]]. The new freeway's wide right-of-way was built with room for additional lanes if the situation became necessary. Although the state of New York and the federal government both helped aid the project, the control of the new highway was turned over to the Suffolk County Superintendent of Highways.<ref name=\"opening1950\">{{cite news |title=New County Road Opens Up Interesting Hinterlands |last=Clayton |first=Coletta |date=January 26, 1950|newspaper=The Patchogue Advance |location=Patchogue, New York}}</ref> In March 1968, CR&nbsp;76 was truncated to begin at [[New York State Route 347|NY&nbsp;347]] while CR&nbsp;78 was extended northwestward over CR&nbsp;76's former routing to [[New York State Route 25|NY&nbsp;25]] in [[Commack, New York|Commack]].<ref name=\"scr\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/suffcr.pdf |format=PDF |title=County Road System \u2013 County of Suffolk, New York |publisher=Suffolk County Department of Public Works |date=December 29, 2005 |accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the Nassau\u2013Suffolk Regional Planning Board brought up plans to convert CR&nbsp;78 into a six-lane expressway with new service roads.

The studies suggested that the state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge.

At the end of 2013, it had 52,121 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\nBad Salzuflen lies on the eastern edge of the [[Ravensberg Basin]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Salze (Bega)]] with the [[Werre]]. In comparison to other North [[Lippe]] communities it is densely populated. The city centre is surrounded by districts with a village like feel to them and agricultural land. North east of the River Werre and Salze (Bega) runs a strand of the Lipper highlands runs through the largely wooded hills with elevations up to 250 meters in the city. The lowest point is on the border of the River Werre at [[Herford]] at about 70 meters. Since 2008, the city is part of the [[Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park|Teutoburg Forest Nature Park / Eggegebirge]].\n\nThe municipal area is crossed by the river floodplains of the Werre, and Salze. [[Podzol]] and [[Stagnosol]] brown soils prevail as soil types. The podzolic soils are mainly found in layers from the Tertiary Period, which are crossed by fault block from the Mesozoic. Characteristic of Bad Salzuflen are the saline springs that emerge at these geological folds and which give the region the name of \"Germany's healing garden\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style= style=\"text-align:left;\"| Name || style=\"text-align:left\" | Drilled in: || style=\"text-align:left\" | Depth [m]|| style=\"text-align:left\" | Temperature [\u00b0C] || Used for: || Image\n|-\n| Paulinenquelle || 1802 || 63 ||12,2|| Inhalation<br /> Gradierung||[[File:Paulinenquelle BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Loosequelle ||1889/91 || 400||14,25 || Drinking Cure||[[File:Loosequelle BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Leopold-<br />Thermalsprudel|| 1904/6||534||21,7|| Bathing|||[[File:D-NW-Bad Salzuflen - Leopoldsprudel.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Neubrunnen|| 1913|| 54|| 12,2|| Bathing ||[[File:Neubrunnen BS.JPG|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Gustav Horstmann<br />Thermalsprudel|| 1919/27|| 1018|| 38,0|| Bathing ||[[File:Gustav Horstmann Thermalsprudel BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Inselquelle|| 1936|| 52,4|| 12,6 || Drinking Cure ||[[File:Inselbrunnen BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Sophienbrunnen|| 1953|| 12,5|| 11,7 || Drinking Cure ||\n|-\n| Thermalsprudel III|| 1956/60|| 412,75|| 21,4 || Bathing ||[[File:Therme III BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Sophienquellen<br />(a und b)|| 1962|| 49,6<br />9,0|| 13,05<br />13,55|| Gradation Bathing||[[File:Sophienquelle 08.jpg|30x30px]]\n|}\n[[File:Bad Salzuflen geothermische Karte.png|thumb|right|Bad Salzuflen Geothermal map]]\nThe geothermal heat sources are of sufficient quality that it makes it viable to use heat recovery systems utilising borehole heat exchangers and heat pumps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gd.nrw.de/zip/a_pjgt01.pdf |publisher=Geologischer Dienst NRW |title=Erdw\u00e4rme nutzen \u2013 Geothermiestudie liefert Planungsgrundlage |accessdate=14 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524234238/http://www.gd.nrw.de/zip/a_pjgt01.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Expansion and use of the urban area===\n\nThe part of Bad Salzulfen classified as the main central town covers an area of {{convert|100.06|km2}}.

All three communities are part of the district of Lippe. To the west lies the county town of [[Bielefeld]] and in the north west, the city of Herford. To the north Bad Salzuflen borders on [[Vlotho]] in the district of Herford. Together with Herford, Bad Salzuflen belongs to conurbation of [[Bielefeld]].\n\n===Areas of the town===\n\nThe city is divided into twelve districts Bad Salzuflen, Biemsen-Ahmsen, Ehrsen-Breden, Grastrup-H\u00f6lsen (with H\u00f6lserheide), Holzhausen (with Sylbach), Lockhausen, Papenhausen (with Volkhausen) Retzen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe (with Knetterheide), W\u00fclfer-Bexten and the largest area in the district of W\u00fcsten (with Frettholz, Glimke, Heller Hausen, Hollenstein, Pehlen, Pillenbruch, Vo\u00dfhagen and Waldemeine). The most populous districts are Bad Salzuflen with about 19,700 inhabitants, Schotmar with 8,900, Werl-Aspe with 7,500 and W\u00fcsten with 4,000 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-bad-salzuflen.de/home/content.php?vlink=165&SHMID=78&sklick=0|title= Website of Bad Salzuflen; Population|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> Together, these four districts over 70% of the population of Bad Salzuflen.

The annual average temperature of 9.3&nbsp;\u00b0C corresponds to the latitude and the altitude, however, the annual sum of precipitation is 743&nbsp;mm which is slightly higher than the North German (640&nbsp;mm) or the German average (690&nbsp;mm), but due to its location in the rain shadow of the Teutoburg Forest, is slightly lower than the average for Lippe (877&nbsp;mm).\n{{Clear}}\n{{Weather box\n|location=Bad Salzuflen\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C = \n|Feb record high C = \n|Mar record high C = \n|Apr record high C = \n|May record high C = \n|Jun record high C = \n|Jul record high C = \n|Aug record high C = \n|Sep record high C = \n|Oct record high C = \n|Nov record high C = \n|Dec record high C =\n|year record high C =\n\n|Jan high C=3\n|Feb high C=5\n|Mar high C=8\n|Apr high C=13\n|May high C=18\n|Jun high C=21\n|Jul high C=22\n|Aug high C=22\n|Sep high C=19\n|Oct high C=14\n|Nov high C=8\n|Dec high C=5\n|year high C=\n\n|Jan mean C=1.5\n|Feb mean C=1.9\n|Mar mean C=4.7\n|Apr mean C=8.3\n|May mean C=12.8\n|Jun mean C=15.8\n|Jul mean C=17.2\n|Aug mean C=17.0\n|Sep mean C=13.9\n|Oct mean C=10.2\n|Nov mean C=5.4\n|Dec mean C=2.5\n\n|Jan low C=\u22121\n|Feb low C=\u22121\n|Mar low C=1\n|Apr low C=4\n|May low C=8\n|Jun low C=11\n|Jul low C= 13\n|Aug low C=13\n|Sep low C=10\n|Oct low C=7\n|Nov low C=3\n|Dec low C=-0\n|year low C=\n\n|Jan record low C = \n|Feb record low C = \n|Mar record low C = \n|Apr record low C = \n|May record low C = \n|Jun record low C = \n|Jul record low C = \n|Aug record low C =\n|Sep record low C = \n|Oct record low C = \n|Nov record low C = \n|Dec record low C = \n|year record low C =\n\n|Jan rain mm=68\n|Feb rain mm=52\n|Mar rain mm=62\n|Apr rain mm=58\n|May rain mm=72\n|Jun rain mm=83\n|Jul rain mm=73\n|Aug rain mm=68\n|Sep rain mm=64\n|Oct rain mm=53\n|Nov rain mm=66\n|Dec rain mm=78\n|Jan rain days=17\n|Feb rain days=15\n|Mar rain days=12\n|Apr rain days=15\n|May rain days=13\n|Jun rain days=13\n|Jul rain days=15\n|Aug rain days=15\n|Sep rain days=13\n|Oct rain days=14\n|Nov rain days=16\n|Dec rain days=15\n|unit rain days= \n|Jan sun=\n|Feb sun=\n|Mar sun=\n|Apr sun=\n|May sun=\n|Jun sun=\n|Jul sun=\n|Aug sun=\n|Sep sun=\n|Oct sun=\n|Nov sun=\n|Dec sun=\n|year sun=\n|source 1=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_windowLabel=T3200039671164966383319&_state=maximized&_pageLabel=dwdwww_start |title=Wetter und Klima \u2013 Deutscher Wetterdienst \u2013 Startseite |publisher=Dwd.de |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetterkontor.de/de/klima/klima2.asp?land=de&stat=10325 |title=Klima Deutschland, Bad Salzuflen \u2013 Klimadiagramm, Klimatabelle \u2013 WetterKontor |publisher=Wetterkontor.de |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n|date=April 2013}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Katzenturm Bad Salzuflen.JPG|thumb|Der Katzenturm]]\n[[File:D-NW-Bad Salzuflen - Notgeld 10Pf 01.jpg|thumb|Notgeld der Stadt Bad Salzuflen]]\nThe first mention of the settlement of ''Uflon'' comes in the middle of the eleventh century and of a ''place of salt'' nearby. In Old High German \"Uflon\"means ''The Woods/Forest''. This later evolved into ''Uflen'', '' Mitteluflen'' and ''Dorf Uflen''. Therefore the entire name means ''The salt baths in the woods''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/Bad_Salzuflen#Ortsursprung |title=Bad Salzuflen \u2013 GenWiki |language=de |publisher=Wiki-de.genealogy.net |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt was the use of the Pauline salt source in the Middle Ages that led to the establishment of the first ''Saline''. These salt workshops were located at a place which is still called ''the Salt Yard'' or ''Salzhof'' and the well is represented in the town's coat of arms. Thanks to the lucrative salt trade and the promotion of the town to a city by the Counts of Sternberg, it was fortified with a circular wall and four gates. The Schliepsteiner gateway lies to the north (toward Exter), He\u00dfkamper gateway to North East (toward W\u00fcsten), Arminius to the southeast (toward Schotmar) and Herford Gateway to the West (toward Herford) with three fortified towers which also included the Katzenturm which can still be seen today. Until the Thirty Years' War, trading flourished with the white gold and brought great wealth to the town. The old houses, the sumptuous B\u00fcrgerh\u00e4user and the Town Hall built in 1545/47 bear witness to this.  The oldest surviving building in the city today is a three-storey Traufenbau of 1520.\n[[File:Stadtbefestigung.svg|thumb|left|Map of the city wall]]\nBad Salzuflen was made famous by its cures. With its three drinking water, three thermal and three salt springs it had the status of a Lippischer State bath. Although the founding of the royal Solebads was made nearly 100 years ago, Salzuflen only received the additional name \"Bad\" on 14 April 1914.\n\nBad Salzuflen was one of the few cities in the Middle Ages that did not suffer from financial difficulties because of its salt production, its topographical position and its thriving commercial development. This is proven today by the many beautiful houses with their typical architectural style for that time. The high healing properties of the water meant that new bath houses were built and other sources were drilled, such as the Leopoldsprudel whose sacred well is in the midst of today's spa gardens. The development of the resort led to significant changes in the cityscape. The saltworks on the Salzhof discontinued salt production and is now the \"town square\" where the weekly market and town festivals take place. The Gradierwerke developed into a place that people with respiratory diseases retreated to. Over time, the long-established industry sectors disappeared and were replaced by the trading and spa industry, which benefited the numerous inns of the city.\n\nThe economic boom in the 19th Century was also closely followed by the founding in 1850 of the Hoffmann starch factories that later rose to be the biggest European starch producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.nrw.de/archive/script/bestand/haupt2.asp?nr=4&B_Id=212|title=Economic Upturn|accessdate=14 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225115736/http://www.archive.nrw.de/archive/script/bestand/haupt2.asp?nr=4&B_id=212|archivedate=25 February 2006}}</ref> The strategic location of Bad Salzuflen was rather insignificant and so was preserved largely during the Second World War from Allied bombing raids, and survived the war relatively unscathed after the war ended.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1924, the ''Bad Salzufler und Sch\u00f6tmarschen Stra\u00dfenbahn GmbH'' plied their trade between those towns. From 1963, the Herford Light railway ran between the towns of Wallenbr\u00fcck, Spenge, Herford, Vlotho, Weserhafen and the west of Herford.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Religion==\n\nIn Bad Salzuflen, there are a variety of different religious communities. As the town is in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] dominated Lippe District, they outweigh other evangelical [[Christianity|Christians]]. The [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Reformed Congregation]] are a part of the reformed Lippe Church and the Evangelical Lutheran congregation are unique in the town. There is a small [[Roman Catholic]] presence in the town as well as [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], Gospel Christians, [[Mennonite Brethren Church|Mennonite Brethren]], [[New Apostolics]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s. There is also a small [[Muslim]] community with a mosque in the town.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 11.6% Roman Catholic Church and 54.5% Evangelical Church with other religions and those stating no religion making up the remaining 33.9%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/z/zensus_2011/gemeindeblaetter/B05766008.pdf|title=2011 Census|accessdate=14 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428121404/http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/z/zensus_2011/gemeindeblaetter/B05766008.pdf|archive-date=28 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Churches===\n\nAt the site of today's Evangelical Reformed Church of St. Kilian ([[Gothic Revival architecture|neogothic]]) on the Kirchplatz in Schotmar stood the original building from around the year 800 AD, the first Christian church in the region. She is the mother parish for many villages in the surrounding area. It is a three-aisled neo-Gothic hall church. The west tower has an octagonal floor, which is crowned by a lantern-like roof riders with steep roof.\n\nThe Evangelical Reformed City Church is located on the area known as Hallenbrink, the highest elevation within the old town. The core of the late medieval hall building was rebuilt in 1762 after a fire. In 1892 there was a comprehensive renovation and expansion of the building. The most important piece is the pulpit made in 1765 by Heinrich Kamp Meyer. The community center near the town church is a [[stucco]] building with stepped gables, built in 1928 in expressionist style.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in the Martin-Luther-Stra\u00dfe is run under supervision by Karl Siebold (Schildesche), a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|neo-Romanesque]] church built around 1891\u20131892 after a design by architect Hermann Held (Bethel). The foundation stone was laid on 12 July 1891, the inauguration took place on 8 May 1892, the [[Jubilate Sunday]]. In 1908\u20131909 the church was enlarged by Karl Siebold to the western part with tower. A new extension was carried out in 1939 by Gerhard Balke (Bethel).\n\nThe Catholic Church of Our Lady is at the corner of Grabenstra\u00dfe and Woldemarstra\u00dfe. The groundbreaking ceremony was on 23 September 1956 which began construction of the church, which was designed by the architect Joseph Lucas in Paderborn, with the foundation stone laid on 8 December 1956. The consecration took place on 8 March 1959 under the title: \"Mary, Our Lady, Queen of Peace.\"\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Resurrection on the corner Gr\u00f6chteweg and Volkhausenstra\u00dfe was built in 1964\u20131966 by the architect Loos (Bad Salzuflen). A significant contribution by the artist couple Hans-Helmuth von Rath and Margarete von Rath (Bad Salzuflen) can be seen in the artwork. The foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1964, and on 1 May 1966 the Jubilate Sunday, the church was consecrated. The Church of the Resurrection is used by the Lutheran and Reformed churches.\n<gallery>\nSch\u00f6tmar Ref Kilianskirche.JPG|Kilianskirche - Evangelical Reformed Church of St. Kilian\nStadtkirche auf dem Hallenbrink.JPG|Tower of the Stadtkirche on the Hallenbrink\nErl\u00f6serkirche (Bad Salzuflen).jpg|Erl\u00f6serkirche - Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer\nLiebfrauenkirche.JPG|Liebfrauenkirche - Catholic Church of Our Lady\nAuferstehungskirche Bad Salzuflen.JPG|Auferstehungskirche - Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Resurrection\n</gallery>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTwo years after the division of the Free State of Lippe into districts, Bad Salzuflen was incorporated into in the county of Lemgo in 1934.

At the end of 2013, it had 52,121 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\nBad Salzuflen lies on the eastern edge of the [[Ravensberg Basin]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Salze (Bega)]] with the [[Werre]]. In comparison to other North [[Lippe]] communities it is densely populated. The city centre is surrounded by districts with a village like feel to them and agricultural land. North east of the River Werre and Salze (Bega) runs a strand of the Lipper highlands runs through the largely wooded hills with elevations up to 250 meters in the city. The lowest point is on the border of the River Werre at [[Herford]] at about 70 meters. Since 2008, the city is part of the [[Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park|Teutoburg Forest Nature Park / Eggegebirge]].\n\nThe municipal area is crossed by the river floodplains of the Werre, and Salze. [[Podzol]] and [[Stagnosol]] brown soils prevail as soil types. The podzolic soils are mainly found in layers from the Tertiary Period, which are crossed by fault block from the Mesozoic. Characteristic of Bad Salzuflen are the saline springs that emerge at these geological folds and which give the region the name of \"Germany's healing garden\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style= style=\"text-align:left;\"| Name || style=\"text-align:left\" | Drilled in: || style=\"text-align:left\" | Depth [m]|| style=\"text-align:left\" | Temperature [\u00b0C] || Used for: || Image\n|-\n| Paulinenquelle || 1802 || 63 ||12,2|| Inhalation<br /> Gradierung||[[File:Paulinenquelle BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Loosequelle ||1889/91 || 400||14,25 || Drinking Cure||[[File:Loosequelle BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Leopold-<br />Thermalsprudel|| 1904/6||534||21,7|| Bathing|||[[File:D-NW-Bad Salzuflen - Leopoldsprudel.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Neubrunnen|| 1913|| 54|| 12,2|| Bathing ||[[File:Neubrunnen BS.JPG|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Gustav Horstmann<br />Thermalsprudel|| 1919/27|| 1018|| 38,0|| Bathing ||[[File:Gustav Horstmann Thermalsprudel BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Inselquelle|| 1936|| 52,4|| 12,6 || Drinking Cure ||[[File:Inselbrunnen BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Sophienbrunnen|| 1953|| 12,5|| 11,7 || Drinking Cure ||\n|-\n| Thermalsprudel III|| 1956/60|| 412,75|| 21,4 || Bathing ||[[File:Therme III BS.jpg|30x30px]]\n|-\n| Sophienquellen<br />(a und b)|| 1962|| 49,6<br />9,0|| 13,05<br />13,55|| Gradation Bathing||[[File:Sophienquelle 08.jpg|30x30px]]\n|}\n[[File:Bad Salzuflen geothermische Karte.png|thumb|right|Bad Salzuflen Geothermal map]]\nThe geothermal heat sources are of sufficient quality that it makes it viable to use heat recovery systems utilising borehole heat exchangers and heat pumps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gd.nrw.de/zip/a_pjgt01.pdf |publisher=Geologischer Dienst NRW |title=Erdw\u00e4rme nutzen \u2013 Geothermiestudie liefert Planungsgrundlage |accessdate=14 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524234238/http://www.gd.nrw.de/zip/a_pjgt01.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Expansion and use of the urban area===\n\nThe part of Bad Salzulfen classified as the main central town covers an area of {{convert|100.06|km2}}.

All three communities are part of the district of Lippe. To the west lies the county town of [[Bielefeld]] and in the north west, the city of Herford. To the north Bad Salzuflen borders on [[Vlotho]] in the district of Herford. Together with Herford, Bad Salzuflen belongs to conurbation of [[Bielefeld]].\n\n===Areas of the town===\n\nThe city is divided into twelve districts Bad Salzuflen, Biemsen-Ahmsen, Ehrsen-Breden, Grastrup-H\u00f6lsen (with H\u00f6lserheide), Holzhausen (with Sylbach), Lockhausen, Papenhausen (with Volkhausen) Retzen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe (with Knetterheide), W\u00fclfer-Bexten and the largest area in the district of W\u00fcsten (with Frettholz, Glimke, Heller Hausen, Hollenstein, Pehlen, Pillenbruch, Vo\u00dfhagen and Waldemeine). The most populous districts are Bad Salzuflen with about 19,700 inhabitants, Schotmar with 8,900, Werl-Aspe with 7,500 and W\u00fcsten with 4,000 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-bad-salzuflen.de/home/content.php?vlink=165&SHMID=78&sklick=0|title= Website of Bad Salzuflen; Population|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> Together, these four districts over 70% of the population of Bad Salzuflen. The districts of Bad Salzuflen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe, Holzhausen and Ehrsen-Breden form a continuous area of settlement.\n\n===Climate===\n\nBad Salzuflen displays the typical fully humid temperate climate for Central Europe, with its maximum rainfall during the summer. The annual average temperature of 9.3&nbsp;\u00b0C corresponds to the latitude and the altitude, however, the annual sum of precipitation is 743&nbsp;mm which is slightly higher than the North German (640&nbsp;mm) or the German average (690&nbsp;mm), but due to its location in the rain shadow of the Teutoburg Forest, is slightly lower than the average for Lippe (877&nbsp;mm).\n{{Clear}}\n{{Weather box\n|location=Bad Salzuflen\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C = \n|Feb record high C = \n|Mar record high C = \n|Apr record high C = \n|May record high C = \n|Jun record high C = \n|Jul record high C = \n|Aug record high C = \n|Sep record high C = \n|Oct record high C = \n|Nov record high C = \n|Dec record high C =\n|year record high C =\n\n|Jan high C=3\n|Feb high C=5\n|Mar high C=8\n|Apr high C=13\n|May high C=18\n|Jun high C=21\n|Jul high C=22\n|Aug high C=22\n|Sep high C=19\n|Oct high C=14\n|Nov high C=8\n|Dec high C=5\n|year high C=\n\n|Jan mean C=1.5\n|Feb mean C=1.9\n|Mar mean C=4.7\n|Apr mean C=8.3\n|May mean C=12.8\n|Jun mean C=15.8\n|Jul mean C=17.2\n|Aug mean C=17.0\n|Sep mean C=13.9\n|Oct mean C=10.2\n|Nov mean C=5.4\n|Dec mean C=2.5\n\n|Jan low C=\u22121\n|Feb low C=\u22121\n|Mar low C=1\n|Apr low C=4\n|May low C=8\n|Jun low C=11\n|Jul low C= 13\n|Aug low C=13\n|Sep low C=10\n|Oct low C=7\n|Nov low C=3\n|Dec low C=-0\n|year low C=\n\n|Jan record low C = \n|Feb record low C = \n|Mar record low C = \n|Apr record low C = \n|May record low C = \n|Jun record low C = \n|Jul record low C = \n|Aug record low C =\n|Sep record low C = \n|Oct record low C = \n|Nov record low C = \n|Dec record low C = \n|year record low C =\n\n|Jan rain mm=68\n|Feb rain mm=52\n|Mar rain mm=62\n|Apr rain mm=58\n|May rain mm=72\n|Jun rain mm=83\n|Jul rain mm=73\n|Aug rain mm=68\n|Sep rain mm=64\n|Oct rain mm=53\n|Nov rain mm=66\n|Dec rain mm=78\n|Jan rain days=17\n|Feb rain days=15\n|Mar rain days=12\n|Apr rain days=15\n|May rain days=13\n|Jun rain days=13\n|Jul rain days=15\n|Aug rain days=15\n|Sep rain days=13\n|Oct rain days=14\n|Nov rain days=16\n|Dec rain days=15\n|unit rain days= \n|Jan sun=\n|Feb sun=\n|Mar sun=\n|Apr sun=\n|May sun=\n|Jun sun=\n|Jul sun=\n|Aug sun=\n|Sep sun=\n|Oct sun=\n|Nov sun=\n|Dec sun=\n|year sun=\n|source 1=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_windowLabel=T3200039671164966383319&_state=maximized&_pageLabel=dwdwww_start |title=Wetter und Klima \u2013 Deutscher Wetterdienst \u2013 Startseite |publisher=Dwd.de |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetterkontor.de/de/klima/klima2.asp?land=de&stat=10325 |title=Klima Deutschland, Bad Salzuflen \u2013 Klimadiagramm, Klimatabelle \u2013 WetterKontor |publisher=Wetterkontor.de |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n|date=April 2013}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Katzenturm Bad Salzuflen.JPG|thumb|Der Katzenturm]]\n[[File:D-NW-Bad Salzuflen - Notgeld 10Pf 01.jpg|thumb|Notgeld der Stadt Bad Salzuflen]]\nThe first mention of the settlement of ''Uflon'' comes in the middle of the eleventh century and of a ''place of salt'' nearby. In Old High German \"Uflon\"means ''The Woods/Forest''. This later evolved into ''Uflen'', '' Mitteluflen'' and ''Dorf Uflen''. Therefore the entire name means ''The salt baths in the woods''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/Bad_Salzuflen#Ortsursprung |title=Bad Salzuflen \u2013 GenWiki |language=de |publisher=Wiki-de.genealogy.net |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt was the use of the Pauline salt source in the Middle Ages that led to the establishment of the first ''Saline''. These salt workshops were located at a place which is still called ''the Salt Yard'' or ''Salzhof'' and the well is represented in the town's coat of arms. Thanks to the lucrative salt trade and the promotion of the town to a city by the Counts of Sternberg, it was fortified with a circular wall and four gates. The Schliepsteiner gateway lies to the north (toward Exter), He\u00dfkamper gateway to North East (toward W\u00fcsten), Arminius to the southeast (toward Schotmar) and Herford Gateway to the West (toward Herford) with three fortified towers which also included the Katzenturm which can still be seen today. Until the Thirty Years' War, trading flourished with the white gold and brought great wealth to the town. The old houses, the sumptuous B\u00fcrgerh\u00e4user and the Town Hall built in 1545/47 bear witness to this.  The oldest surviving building in the city today is a three-storey Traufenbau of 1520.\n[[File:Stadtbefestigung.svg|thumb|left|Map of the city wall]]\nBad Salzuflen was made famous by its cures. With its three drinking water, three thermal and three salt springs it had the status of a Lippischer State bath. Although the founding of the royal Solebads was made nearly 100 years ago, Salzuflen only received the additional name \"Bad\" on 14 April 1914.\n\nBad Salzuflen was one of the few cities in the Middle Ages that did not suffer from financial difficulties because of its salt production, its topographical position and its thriving commercial development. This is proven today by the many beautiful houses with their typical architectural style for that time. The high healing properties of the water meant that new bath houses were built and other sources were drilled, such as the Leopoldsprudel whose sacred well is in the midst of today's spa gardens. The development of the resort led to significant changes in the cityscape. The saltworks on the Salzhof discontinued salt production and is now the \"town square\" where the weekly market and town festivals take place. The Gradierwerke developed into a place that people with respiratory diseases retreated to. Over time, the long-established industry sectors disappeared and were replaced by the trading and spa industry, which benefited the numerous inns of the city.\n\nThe economic boom in the 19th Century was also closely followed by the founding in 1850 of the Hoffmann starch factories that later rose to be the biggest European starch producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.nrw.de/archive/script/bestand/haupt2.asp?nr=4&B_Id=212|title=Economic Upturn|accessdate=14 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225115736/http://www.archive.nrw.de/archive/script/bestand/haupt2.asp?nr=4&B_id=212|archivedate=25 February 2006}}</ref> The strategic location of Bad Salzuflen was rather insignificant and so was preserved largely during the Second World War from Allied bombing raids, and survived the war relatively unscathed after the war ended.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1924, the ''Bad Salzufler und Sch\u00f6tmarschen Stra\u00dfenbahn GmbH'' plied their trade between those towns. From 1963, the Herford Light railway ran between the towns of Wallenbr\u00fcck, Spenge, Herford, Vlotho, Weserhafen and the west of Herford.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Religion==\n\nIn Bad Salzuflen, there are a variety of different religious communities. As the town is in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] dominated Lippe District, they outweigh other evangelical [[Christianity|Christians]]. The [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Reformed Congregation]] are a part of the reformed Lippe Church and the Evangelical Lutheran congregation are unique in the town. There is a small [[Roman Catholic]] presence in the town as well as [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], Gospel Christians, [[Mennonite Brethren Church|Mennonite Brethren]], [[New Apostolics]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s. There is also a small [[Muslim]] community with a mosque in the town.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 11.6% Roman Catholic Church and 54.5% Evangelical Church with other religions and those stating no religion making up the remaining 33.9%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/z/zensus_2011/gemeindeblaetter/B05766008.pdf|title=2011 Census|accessdate=14 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428121404/http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/z/zensus_2011/gemeindeblaetter/B05766008.pdf|archive-date=28 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Churches===\n\nAt the site of today's Evangelical Reformed Church of St. Kilian ([[Gothic Revival architecture|neogothic]]) on the Kirchplatz in Schotmar stood the original building from around the year 800 AD, the first Christian church in the region. She is the mother parish for many villages in the surrounding area. It is a three-aisled neo-Gothic hall church. The west tower has an octagonal floor, which is crowned by a lantern-like roof riders with steep roof.\n\nThe Evangelical Reformed City Church is located on the area known as Hallenbrink, the highest elevation within the old town. The core of the late medieval hall building was rebuilt in 1762 after a fire. In 1892 there was a comprehensive renovation and expansion of the building. The most important piece is the pulpit made in 1765 by Heinrich Kamp Meyer. The community center near the town church is a [[stucco]] building with stepped gables, built in 1928 in expressionist style.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in the Martin-Luther-Stra\u00dfe is run under supervision by Karl Siebold (Schildesche), a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|neo-Romanesque]] church built around 1891\u20131892 after a design by architect Hermann Held (Bethel). The foundation stone was laid on 12 July 1891, the inauguration took place on 8 May 1892, the [[Jubilate Sunday]]. In 1908\u20131909 the church was enlarged by Karl Siebold to the western part with tower. A new extension was carried out in 1939 by Gerhard Balke (Bethel).\n\nThe Catholic Church of Our Lady is at the corner of Grabenstra\u00dfe and Woldemarstra\u00dfe. The groundbreaking ceremony was on 23 September 1956 which began construction of the church, which was designed by the architect Joseph Lucas in Paderborn, with the foundation stone laid on 8 December 1956. The consecration took place on 8 March 1959 under the title: \"Mary, Our Lady, Queen of Peace.\"\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Resurrection on the corner Gr\u00f6chteweg and Volkhausenstra\u00dfe was built in 1964\u20131966 by the architect Loos (Bad Salzuflen). A significant contribution by the artist couple Hans-Helmuth von Rath and Margarete von Rath (Bad Salzuflen) can be seen in the artwork. The foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1964, and on 1 May 1966 the Jubilate Sunday, the church was consecrated. The Church of the Resurrection is used by the Lutheran and Reformed churches.\n<gallery>\nSch\u00f6tmar Ref Kilianskirche.JPG|Kilianskirche - Evangelical Reformed Church of St. Kilian\nStadtkirche auf dem Hallenbrink.JPG|Tower of the Stadtkirche on the Hallenbrink\nErl\u00f6serkirche (Bad Salzuflen).jpg|Erl\u00f6serkirche - Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer\nLiebfrauenkirche.JPG|Liebfrauenkirche - Catholic Church of Our Lady\nAuferstehungskirche Bad Salzuflen.JPG|Auferstehungskirche - Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Resurrection\n</gallery>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTwo years after the division of the Free State of Lippe into districts, Bad Salzuflen was incorporated into in the county of Lemgo in 1934.
