Until 1972, Ceylon was a [[Commonwealth realm]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as the head of state and Queen of Ceylon. He served as Governor-General during the tenure of different governments headed by [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] of the [[SLFP]] and [[Dudley Senanayake]] of the [[United National Party|UNP]].\n\n== Early life and education==\nWilliam Gopallawa was born on 17 September 1896 at the Dullewe Maha Walauwa, Dullewe, [[Aluvihare]], a suburb of [[Matale]]. He is related to Dullewe [[Dissava]], a signatory on behalf of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] to the [[Kandyan Convention|Kandiyan Convention of 1815]], by his mother Tikiri Kumarihamy Dullewe.

He continued his secondary education at [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy]] where he was a Scout and later moved to [[St. Anthony's College, Kandy]].<ref name=Dailynewsbio/> After having sat the Cambridge Senior Certificate Examination in 1917 he returned to Matale and joined as one of the tutorial staff of the [[Vijaya College, Matale|Buddhist English School]] and was also instrumental in setting up a library and a [[Scout troop]] for the benefit of the students there. \n\n== Legal career ==\nIn 1920 William joined the [[Ceylon Law College]], [[Colombo]] and was enrolled as a [[Proctor]] and [[Notary Public]] in 1924. He started his legal practice as a junior to Bernard Aluvihare in the [[unofficial bar]] of Kandy and went on to develop a practice in Matale, Dumbara and Kandy from 1924 until he took up duties as Municipal Commissioner, Kandy in 1939. He continued his practice on and off until he became the Municipal Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council.\n\n[[File:H.E William Gopallawa & Dr Nissanka Wijeyeratne- brightened.jpg|thumb|left|200px| President William Gopallawa and First Lady Seela Gopallawa with Diyawadana Nilame [[Nissanka Wijeyeratne|Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne]] at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kandy]]\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1926 Gopallawa contested and won in the Matale Urban Council Elections and served continuously in the council for a period of 13 years from 1926 to 1939. He served as the chairman of the Matale Urban Council for 5 years, at his office he was the youngest Urban Council Chairman in Ceylon at that time. In 1936 Gopallawa unsuccessfully contested for the Matale seat at the [[State Council of Ceylon|State Council]] Elections in 1936. In 1939 the Kandy Municipal Council was established and Gopallawa was appointed as the first [[Municipal commissioner|Municipal Commissioner]] of Kandy. He served in that capacity throughout [[World War II]] and acquitted himself for efficiency during the great floods in 1950. In 1951 he was appointment as Municipal Commissioner of [[Colombo Municipal Council]] and served until 1957 when he stepped down from the post.\n\n==Diplomatic role==\nOn 18 June 1958 when [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]]'s government started diplomatic relations with People's Republic of China Gopallawa was posted as the second Ambassador to China in 1960. On 7 September 1961, while he was serving in China, he was recalled and posted as the Ambassador to the United States; he served there until 1962.\n\n==Governor-General of Ceylon and President of Sri Lanka==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:President William Gopallawa.jpg|thumb|right|William Gopallawa]] -->\nIn 1962, he was called back to Ceylon, after his son in law's sister, the then prime minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] nominated Gopallawa as [[Governor-General of Ceylon]] following [[Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke|Sir Oliver Goonetilleke]]'s implication in the [[Attempted military coup in Ceylon, 1962|attempted military coup]] earlier that year. He was the second Ceylonese Governor-General and the first Buddhist to hold the post as the representative of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] who was the Head of State. Gopallawa served in this capacity until 1972.\n\nHis constitutional decision to invite the [[United National Party|UNP]] which won the majority of Parliamentary seats in the 1965 general election, (but not enough for an absolute majority) is heralded as a landmark moment where he respected the nation's constitution and its people's wishes more than the wishes of the defeated SLFP government (that appointed him as GG) which wanted him to delay inviting the winning party to form the government. It averted a major crisis of leadership.\n\nWhen Ceylon became the Republic of Sri Lanka on 2 March 1972, Gopallawa became the first President. He stepped down from office in February 1978 when then Prime Minister [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] became President following constitutional changes that effected the creation of an executive Presidency.\n\n==Faith==\nWhile he was a devout Buddhist, he respected all faiths and never failed to attend the annual Vel Hindu ceremony and never failed to host Christmas carols and also attended various Muslim ceremonies in his role as titular head of state; he was acutely cognizant of his role as a unifier of all Sri Lankans during his tenure. He was the first to establish a spartan Buddhist Shrine room at the [[President's House, Colombo|Queen's House]].\n\n==Family==\nOn 8 March 1928, Gopallawa married [[Seelawathie Gopallawa|Seelawathie Rambukwella]];they had 5 children. He was survived by 4 children out of 5. One died early on while he was still working in Matale. His eldest daughter Chandrika Iranganie married Dr. Mackie Ratwatte, the private secretary and a brother of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]].

Until 1972, Ceylon was a [[Commonwealth realm]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as the head of state and Queen of Ceylon. He served as Governor-General during the tenure of different governments headed by [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] of the [[SLFP]] and [[Dudley Senanayake]] of the [[United National Party|UNP]].\n\n== Early life and education==\nWilliam Gopallawa was born on 17 September 1896 at the Dullewe Maha Walauwa, Dullewe, [[Aluvihare]], a suburb of [[Matale]]. He is related to Dullewe [[Dissava]], a signatory on behalf of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] to the [[Kandyan Convention|Kandiyan Convention of 1815]], by his mother Tikiri Kumarihamy Dullewe.

He continued his secondary education at [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy]] where he was a Scout and later moved to [[St. Anthony's College, Kandy]].<ref name=Dailynewsbio/> After having sat the Cambridge Senior Certificate Examination in 1917 he returned to Matale and joined as one of the tutorial staff of the [[Vijaya College, Matale|Buddhist English School]] and was also instrumental in setting up a library and a [[Scout troop]] for the benefit of the students there. \n\n== Legal career ==\nIn 1920 William joined the [[Ceylon Law College]], [[Colombo]] and was enrolled as a [[Proctor]] and [[Notary Public]] in 1924. He started his legal practice as a junior to Bernard Aluvihare in the [[unofficial bar]] of Kandy and went on to develop a practice in Matale, Dumbara and Kandy from 1924 until he took up duties as Municipal Commissioner, Kandy in 1939. He continued his practice on and off until he became the the Municipal Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council.\n\n[[File:H.E William Gopallawa & Dr Nissanka Wijeyeratne- brightened.jpg|thumb|left|200px| President William Gopallawa and First Lady Seela Gopallawa with Diyawadana Nilame [[Nissanka Wijeyeratne|Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne]] at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kandy]]\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1926 Gopallawa contested and won in the Matale Urban Council Elections and served continuously in the council for a period of 13 years from 1926 to 1939. He served as the chairman of the Matale Urban Council for 5 years, at his office he was the youngest Urban Council Chairman in Ceylon at that time. In 1936 Gopallawa unsuccessfully contested for the Matale seat at the [[State Council of Ceylon|State Council]] Elections in 1936. In 1939 the Kandy Municipal Council was established and Gopallawa was appointed as the first [[Municipal commissioner|Municipal Commissioner]] of Kandy. He served in that capacity throughout [[World War II]] and acquitted himself for efficiency during the great floods in 1950. In 1951 he was appointment as Municipal Commissioner of [[Colombo Municipal Council]] and served until 1957 when he stepped down from the post.\n\n==Diplomatic role==\nOn 18 June 1958 when [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]]'s government started diplomatic relations with People's Republic of China Gopallawa was posted as the second Ambassador to China in 1960. On 7 September 1961, while he was serving in China, he was recalled and posted as the Ambassador to the United States; he served there until 1962.\n\n==Governor-General of Ceylon and President of Sri Lanka==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:President William Gopallawa.jpg|thumb|right|William Gopallawa]] -->\nIn 1962, he was called back to Ceylon, after his son in law's sister, the then prime minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] nominated Gopallawa as [[Governor-General of Ceylon]] following [[Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke|Sir Oliver Goonetilleke]]'s implication in the [[Attempted military coup in Ceylon, 1962|attempted military coup]] earlier that year. He was the second Ceylonese Governor-General and the first Buddhist to hold the post as the representative of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] who was the Head of State. Gopallawa served in this capacity until 1972.\n\nHis constitutional decision to invite the [[United National Party|UNP]] which won the majority of Parliamentary seats in the 1965 general election, (but not enough for an absolute majority) is heralded as a landmark moment where he respected the nation's constitution and its people's wishes more than the wishes of the defeated SLFP government (that appointed him as GG) which wanted him to delay inviting the winning party to form the government. It averted a major crisis of leadership.\n\nWhen Ceylon became the Republic of Sri Lanka on 2 March 1972, Gopallawa became the first President. He stepped down from office in February 1978 when then Prime Minister [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] became President following constitutional changes that effected the creation of an executive Presidency.\n\n==Faith==\nWhile he was a devout Buddhist, he respected all faiths and never failed to attend the annual Vel Hindu ceremony and never failed to host Christmas carols and also attended various Muslim ceremonies in his role as titular head of state; he was acutely cognizant of his role as a unifier of all Sri Lankans during his tenure. He was the first to establish a spartan Buddhist Shrine room at the [[President's House, Colombo|Queen's House]].\n\n==Family==\nOn 8 March 1928, Gopallawa married [[Seelawathie Gopallawa|Seelawathie Rambukwella]];they had 5 children. He was survived by 4 children out of 5. One died early on while he was still working in Matale. His eldest daughter Chandrika Iranganie married Dr. Mackie Ratwatte, the private secretary and a brother of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]. His oldest son Asoka is a entrepreneur businessman, His Second daughter Chinthamani, was a teacher and landed proprietor and his youngest son [[Monty Gopallawa]] who died in 2005 was a member of parliament and an affable cabinet minister in the government of President [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] (daughter of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]).

Together with the [[\u01c2\u02bcAmkoe language]], !Kung forms the [[Kx\u02bca languages|Kx\u02bca language family]]. !Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] language family, and was called '''Northern Khoisan''' in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless, the anthropological term \"Khoisan\" has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.<ref>{{harvnb|Haacke|2009}}</ref>\n\n!Kung is famous for its many [[click consonant|clicks]], such as the [[alveolar click|\u01c3]] in its name, and has some of the most complex inventories of both [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s in the world. It also has [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. For a description, see [[Ju\u01c0'hoan dialect|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]]. To pronounce ''!Xuun'' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|!\u0361\u03c7\u0169\u02d0\u02e6\u02e5|}} in Western !Kung/!Xuun) one makes a [[alveolar click|click sound]] before the ''x'' sound (which is like a Scottish or German ''ch''), followed by a long [[nasal vowel|nasal ''u'' vowel]] with a high rising tone.{{efn|1=For phonology and tones, see list of !Xun dialect names in Heine & Honken (2010).{{sfn|Heine|Honken|2010}} }}\n\n==Names==\nThe term ''!Kung'', or variants thereof, is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute a single language; ''Ju'' tends to be used when considering them as a small language family. ''!Kung'' is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects, as opposed to the well documented ''Ju|\u02bchoan'' dialects in the south(east); however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ''!Kung''.\n\nThe spellings ''!Xun'' and ''!Xuun'' seen in recent literature are related to the Ju|\u02bchoan form spelled ''\u01c3X\u02bcu(u)n'' in the 1975 orthography, or ''\u01c3Ku(u)n'' in current orthography. Additional spellings are ''\u01c3Hu, \u01c3Khung, \u01c3Ku, Kung, Qx\u00fc, \u01c3ung, \u01c3Xo, X\u00fb, \u01c3X\u00fb, Xun, \u01c3Xung, \u01c3X\u0169\u0169, !Xun, \u0297h\u0169:'',<ref name=dok>{{harvnb|Doke|1926}}</ref> and additional spellings of ''Ju'' are ''Dzu, Juu, Zhu''.\n\n==Speakers==\nIf the !Kung dialects are counted together, they would make the third-most-populous click language after [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]].  The most populous !Kung variety, Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, is perhaps tied for third place with [[Naro language|Naro]].\n\nEstimates vary, but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms, interspersed with speakers of other languages, but Brenzinger (2011)<ref name=Brenzinger/> counts 9,000 in Namibia, 2,000 in Botswana, 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola (down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975).\n\nUntil the mid\u2013late twentieth century, the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However, most !Kung fled the [[Angolan Civil War]] to Namibia (primarily to the [[Caprivi Strip]]), where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and [[SWAPO]].

'''Ju''', is a [[dialect continuum]] (language complex) spoken in [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], and [[Angola]] by the [[\u01c3Kung people]], constituting two or three languages. Together with the [[\u01c2\u02bcAmkoe language]], !Kung forms the [[Kx\u02bca languages|Kx\u02bca language family]]. !Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] language family, and was called '''Northern Khoisan''' in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless, the anthropological term \"Khoisan\" has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.<ref>{{harvnb|Haacke|2009}}</ref>\n\n!Kung is famous for its many [[click consonant|clicks]], such as the [[alveolar click|\u01c3]] in its name, and has some of the most complex inventories of both [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s in the world. It also has [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. For a description, see [[Ju\u01c0'hoan dialect|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]]. To pronounce ''!Xuun'' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|!\u0361\u03c7\u0169\u02d0\u02e6\u02e5|}} in Western !Kung/!Xuun) one makes a [[alveolar click|click sound]] before the ''x'' sound (which is like a Scottish or German ''ch''), followed by a long [[nasal vowel|nasal ''u'' vowel]] with a high rising tone.{{efn|1=For phonology and tones, see list of !Xun dialect names in Heine & Honken (2010).{{sfn|Heine|Honken|2010}} }}\n\n==Names==\nThe term ''!Kung'', or variants thereof, is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute a single language; ''Ju'' tends to be used when considering them as a small language family. ''!Kung'' is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects, as opposed to the well documented ''Ju|\u02bchoan'' dialects in the south(east); however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ''!Kung''.\n\nThe spellings ''!Xun'' and ''!Xuun'' seen in recent literature are related to the Ju|\u02bchoan form spelled ''\u01c3X\u02bcu(u)n'' in the 1975 orthography, or ''\u01c3Ku(u)n'' in current orthography. Additional spellings are ''\u01c3Hu, \u01c3Khung, \u01c3Ku, Kung, Qx\u00fc, \u01c3ung, \u01c3Xo, X\u00fb, \u01c3X\u00fb, Xun, \u01c3Xung, \u01c3X\u0169\u0169, !Xun, \u0297h\u0169:'',<ref name=dok>{{harvnb|Doke|1926}}</ref> and additional spellings of ''Ju'' are ''Dzu, Juu, Zhu''.\n\n==Speakers==\nIf the !Kung dialects are counted together, they would make the third-most-populous click language after [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]].  The most populous !Kung variety, Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, is perhaps tied for third place with [[Naro language|Naro]].\n\nEstimates vary, but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms, interspersed with speakers of other languages, but Brenzinger (2011)<ref name=Brenzinger/> counts 9,000 in Namibia, 2,000 in Botswana, 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola (down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975).\n\nUntil the mid\u2013late twentieth century, the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However, most !Kung fled the [[Angolan Civil War]] to Namibia (primarily to the [[Caprivi Strip]]), where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and [[SWAPO]]. At the end of the [[South African Border War|Border War]], more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to [[Schmidtsdrift]] in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia.<ref>{{harvnb|Suzman|2001}}</ref> After more than a decade living in precarious conditions, the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for a permanent settlement at Platfontein, near Schmidtsdrift.<ref>{{harvnb|Robins|Madzudzo|Brenzinger|2001}}</ref>\n\nOnly Ju|'hoan is written, and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both.\n\n==Varieties==\nThe better-known !Kung dialects are [[Ju\u01c0'hoan dialect|Tsumkwe Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], [[Ekoka !Kung]], [[Sekele language|\u01c3\u02bcO\u01c3Kung]], and [[\u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein]]. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects, but the boundaries are unclear. There is a clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast, but also a diverse Central group that is poorly attested.\n\nHeine & Honken (2010) classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider a single language:{{sfn|Heine|Honken|2010}}\n* '''Northern\u2013Western !Xun'''\n::[[Sekele dialect|Northern !Xun]]\n:::(N1) Maligo (''!xuun, k\u00fa\u00e1nd\u00f2 !xuun'' \"Kwando !Xuun\"; SE Angola)\n:::(N2) \u01c3\u02bcO\u01c3Kung (''!\u02bco !u\u014b'' \"Forest !Xuun\"; eastern C Angola)\n::[[Ekoka !Kung|Western !Xun]]\n:::(W1) \u2014 (''!x\u016b\u00fan, !\u02bc\u0101l\u00e8 !x\u00f2\u0101n'' \"Valley !Xuun\"; Eenhana district, N Namibia)\n:::(W2) \u01c0\u02bcAkhwe (''!x\u016b\u00fan, \u01c0\u02bc\u0101kh\u00f2\u00e8 !x\u00f2\u0101n'' \"Kwanyama !Xuun\"; Eenhana, N Namibia)\n:::(W3) Tsintsabis (''!x\u016b\u00fan''; Tsintsabis, Tsumeb district, N Namibia)\n::(K) Kavango !Xuun (''!x\u016b\u00fan'', known as ''dom !x\u016b\u00fan'' \"River !Xuun\" in Ekoka; Western Rundu district, N Namibia, & Angola adjacent)\n* '''[[Central !Kung|Central !Xun]]'''\n::(C1) Gaub (Tsumeb district, N Namibia)\n::(C2) Neitsas (Grootfontein district, N Namibia)\n::tentatively also the Tsintsabis, Leeunes and Mangetti (different from Mangetti Dune) dialects\n* '''[[Ju\u01c0'hoan dialect|Southeastern !Xun]]'''\n::(E1) Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan (''ju-|\u02bchoan(-si)''; Tsumkwe district, N Namibia, & Bots adjacent)\n::(E2) Dikundu (''!xun, ju-|\u02bchoa(si)''; Dikundu, W Caprivi)\n::(E3) [[\u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein]] (''ju-|\u02bchoan(-si), !xun, \u01c2x\u02bc\u0101\u014d\u01c1\u02bc\u00e0\u00e8n'' \"Northern people\"; Gobabis district, E Namibia)\n\nHeine & K\u00f6nig (2015.324) state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects \"understand one another to quite some extent\" but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects.\n\nSands (2010) classifies !Kung dialects into four clusters, with the first two being quite close:<ref>{{harvnb|Sands|2010}}</ref>\n* '''[[Sekele language|Northern !Kung]]''': Southern Angola, around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers, but with many refugees now in Namibia:\n::\u01c3\u02bcO\u01c3Kung\n::Maligo\n* '''[[Ekoka !Kung|North-Central !Kung]]''': Namibia, between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border, around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the [[Etosha pan|Etosha Pan]]:\n::Tsintsabis\n::Okongo\n::Ovambo\n::Mpunguvlei\n::\u01c0\u02bcAkhwe (Ekoka)\n* '''[[Central !Kung]]''': The area around [[Grootfontein]], Namibia, west of the central [[Omatako River]] and south of the [[Ovambo River]]\n* '''[[Ju\u01c0'hoan dialect|Southeastern !Kung]]''': Botswana east of the [[Okavango Delta]], and northeast Namibia from near [[Windhoek]] to [[Rundu]], [[Gobabis]], and the [[Caprivi Strip]]:\n::Tsumkwe\n::Omatako\n::Kameeldoring\n::Epukiro.\n[[\u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein]] was too poorly attested to classify at the time.\n\n==Protolanguage==\nThe ancestral language, Proto-Juu or Proto-!Xuun, had five places of click articulation: [[Dental click|Dental]], [[alveolar click|alveolar]], [[palatal click|palatal]], [[lateral click|alveolar lateral]], and [[retroflex click|retroflex]] ({{IPA|*\u203c}}).

I wrote in [[Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News|'Bias']] that I would make racial discrimination a criminal offense, not just a civil offense. \nOn gay rights, I don\u2019t know anyone more [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] than me. I don\u2019t want the government getting involved in it. I\u2019m pro-abortion with reservations. I\u2019ve never set foot in a country club in my life.\"\n\n\"I consider myself to be an old-fashioned liberal. I\u2019m a liberal the way liberals used to be when they were like [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and when they were like [[Hubert Humphrey|Hubert Humphrey]], when they were upbeat and enthusiastic and mainstream. I am not a liberal the way liberals are today, at least as exemplified by [[Al Franken|Al Franken]] and [[Michael Moore|Michael Moore]], where they\u2019re angry, nasty, closed minded, and not mainstream, but fringe.\"\n\n\"I think this is what really irks the media (about me). That this is coming from one of them. I was one of them for 28 years.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rightwingnews.com/interviews/the-bernard-goldberg-interview-2/|title=The Bernard Goldberg Interview|date=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nGoldberg has since accepted the label of \"conservative,\" saying in 2020, \"I see myself as a conservative with live and let live principles\u2026 a conservative libertarian I guess. Now, even when I agree with liberals on this issue or that, I no longer want to be on their team. I not only don\u2019t accept their new left wing politics, it\u2019s also their holier than thou elitism that annoys me. I no longer see myself as a liberal. They left me, not the other way around.

Despite his old age, he worked his own [[Roman agriculture|small farm]] until an invasion prompted his fellow citizens to call for his leadership. He came from his plow to assume [[Roman dictator|complete control over the state]] but, upon achieving a swift victory, relinquished his power and its perquisites and returned to his farm. His success and immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of this crisis (traditionally dated to 458{{nbsp}}BC) has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, [[civic virtue]], humility, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, some named in his honor.  In the United States, parallels are drawn between Cincinnatus and national hero [[George Washington]], and, as such, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], the town of [[Cincinnatus, New York]], and (indirectly) the city of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] are named after him.\n\nModern historians question eat my ballsack \nsome particulars of the story recounted in [[Livy]] and elsewhere but usually accept Cincinnatus as a historical figure who served as [[suffect consul]] in 460{{nbsp}}BC and as [[Roman dictator|dictator]] in 458{{nbsp}}BC and (possibly) again in 439{{nbsp}}BC, when the patricians called on him to suppress the feared uprising of the plebeians under [[Spurius Maelius]].\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n{{anchor|Biography|History}}\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image |align=left |width=100 |footer=1553 French portraits of Cincinnatus and his wife Racilia or Rasilia |image1=Cincinnatus.jpg |alt1=Cincinnatus |image2=Racilia.jpg |alt2=Racilia }}\nAccording to the traditional accounts, Lucius would have been born about 519{{nbsp}}BC,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=784}} during the last decade of the [[Roman Kingdom]].

Several [[lictor]]s were given to him for protection and enforcement of his orders.\n\nThe next morning, Cincinnatus went to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and named Lucius Tarquitius as his [[Magister equitum|master of the horse]].{{sfnp|''AC''|1879}} He then went to the assembly of the people and ordered every man of military age to appear on the [[Campus Martius|Field of Mars]] (''Campus Martius'') by the end of the day{{sfn|Livy|loc=''History'', III, \u00a7 27}} with twelve times the normal amount of [[Sudis (stake)|encamping spikes]].

Rather than slaughter them between the two Roman camps, Cincinnatus accepted their pleas for mercy and offered an amnesty provided that three principal offenders were executed and Gracchus Cloelius and their other leaders be delivered to him in chains. A \"[[yoke]]\" of three spears was then set up and the Aequi made to pass under it as an act of submission, bowing and admitting their defeat.

One legend from the end of his life claims a Capitolinus defended one of his sons from a charge of military incompetence by asking the jury who would go to tell the aged Cincinnatus the news in the event of a conviction.

was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], [[Roman Senate|statesman]], and [[Roman army|military leader]] of the early [[Roman Republic]] who became a [[legend]]ary figure of [[Virtus (virtue)|Roman virtue]]\u2014particularly [[civic virtue]]\u2014by the time of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].\n\nCincinnatus was a conservative opponent of the rights of the [[plebeians]] (the common citizens) who fell into poverty because of [[Caeso Quinctius|his son]]'s violent opposition to their desire for a [[code of law|written code]] of [[Equality before the law|equitably enforced]] [[Roman law|laws]]. Despite his old age, he worked his own [[Roman agriculture|small farm]] until an invasion prompted his fellow citizens to call for his leadership. He came from his plow to assume [[Roman dictator|complete control over the state]] but, upon achieving a swift victory, relinquished his power and its perquisites and returned to his farm. His success and immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of this crisis (traditionally dated to 458{{nbsp}}BC) has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, [[civic virtue]], humility, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, some named in his honor.  In the United States, parallels are drawn between Cincinnatus and national hero [[George Washington]], and, as such, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], the town of [[Cincinnatus, New York]], and (indirectly) the city of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] are named after him.\n\nModern historians question some particulars of the story recounted in [[Livy]] and elsewhere but usually accept Cincinnatus as a historical figure who served as [[suffect consul]] in 460{{nbsp}}BC and as [[Roman dictator|dictator]] in 458{{nbsp}}BC and (possibly) again in 439{{nbsp}}BC, when the patricians called on him to suppress the feared uprising of the plebeians under [[Spurius Maelius]].\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n{{anchor|Biography|History}}\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image |align=left |width=100 |footer=1553 French portraits of Cincinnatus and his wife Racilia or Rasilia |image1=Cincinnatus.jpg |alt1=Cincinnatus |image2=Racilia.jpg |alt2=Racilia }}\nAccording to the traditional accounts, Lucius would have been born about 519{{nbsp}}BC,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=784}} during the last decade of the [[Roman Kingdom]].

This suggests Lucius was the first of his [[cognomen]] ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]]}}'', meaning \"the [[curly hair]]ed\".{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The family was relatively rich.{{sfnp|''AC''|1879}}\n\nIn the late 460s{{nbsp}}BC, Rome was fending off [[Roman-Aequian wars|raids]] by the [[Aequi]] to their east and, beginning in 462{{nbsp}}BC, the [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribune]] [[G. Terentilius Harsa]] began pressing for [[code of laws|codification]] of the [[Roman law]]s in order to establish a kind of [[constitution]] that would check the near-regal power of the [[Roman patrician|patrician]] consuls. In the years that followed, he and the other plebeians were ignored, fended off, rejected on procedural grounds, and finally beaten and driven from the streets by gangs of patricians and their [[Roman client|clients]], supposedly including Cincinnatus's son [[Caeso Quinctius|Caeso]].\n\nThe violent resistance of the patricians to such a blameless request prompted [[Conflict of the Orders|so much unrest]] that Appius Herdonius was able to seize the [[Capitoline Hill]] and hold it against the city with a gang of outlaws and [[slave revolt|rebel slaves]] (in Livy) or with an army of [[Sabines]] (in Dionysius).{{sfnp|Forsythe|2006|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=aEfvR1Qcd0gC&pg=PA205 205]}} The [[Roman consul|consul]] Publius Valerius Poplicola was killed in its recovery in 460{{nbsp}}BC{{sfnp|''AC''|1879}} and Cincinnatus, probably illegally,<ref name=dicro /> became the [[suffect consul|suffect]] (\"replacement\") consul for the remainder of the year.

Caeso would lead gangs to drive the [[Tribunes of the Plebs]] from the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], disrupting the procedures necessary to approve it. He was brought up on capital charges in 461{{nbsp}}BC but released on a large [[bail]].

The consuls for the year\u2014[[Lucius Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus|L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus]] and [[Gaius Nautius Rutilus|G. Nautius Rutilus]]\u2014led out two armies, one to Tusculum's relief and another to strike against the lands of the Aequi and their [[Sabines|Sabine]] allies. Upon reaching [[Mount Algidus]] in the [[Alban Hills]], the army under L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus encamped and rested instead of immediately attacking. The Aequi quickly deployed around their position and successfully besieged them, with only five [[Roman cavalry|horsemen]] escaping{{sfnp|''AC''|1879}} to tell the [[Roman Senate]] what had happened. With the army of the second consul unable to help, the senators fell into a panic and authorized the nomination of a dictator. G. Nautius Rutilus or Horatius Pulvillus named Cincinnatus for a term of six months.{{sfn|Livy|loc=''History'', III, \u00a7 26}}\n\nA group of senators was sent to Cincinnatus to inform him of his appointment, finding him while he was plowing his farm.{{efn|This story is sometimes told of his election as consul.{{sfnp|''NSRW''|1914}}}} He asked them, \"Is everything all right?\" and they replied that they hoped \"it might turn out well for both him and his country\", asking that he don his [[senatorial toga]] before hearing the Senate's mandate. He then called out to his wife '''Racilia''', telling her to bring his toga from their cottage.{{sfn|Livy|loc=''History'', III, \u00a7 26}} Once he was properly dressed, the delegation hailed him as a dictator and ordered him to come to the city. He crossed the [[Tiber]] in one of the senate's boats and was greeted on his return by his three sons and most of the senators. Several [[lictor]]s were given to him for protection and enforcement of his orders.\n\nThe next morning, Cincinnatus went to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and named Lucius Tarquitius as his [[Magister equitum|master of the horse]].{{sfnp|''AC''|1879}} He then went to the assembly of the people and ordered every man of military age to appear on the [[Campus Martius|Field of Mars]] (''Campus Martius'') by the end of the day{{sfn|Livy|loc=''History'', III, \u00a7 27}} with twelve times the normal amount of [[Sudis (stake)|encamping spikes]]. They then marched to the relief of the consul's relieving army. At the [[Battle of Mount Algidus]], they used their spikes to quickly besiege the besieging Aequi. Rather than slaughter them between the two Roman camps, Cincinnatus accepted their pleas for mercy and offered an amnesty provided that three principal offenders were executed and Gracchus Cloelius and their other leaders be delivered to him in chains. A \"[[yoke]]\" of three spears was then set up and the Aequi made to pass under it as an act of submission, bowing and admitting their defeat. Cincinnatus then disbanded his army and returned to his farm, abandoning his control a mere fifteen days after it had been granted to him.{{sfn|Livy|loc=''History'', III, \u00a7\u00a7 28\u201329}}\n\n===Second dictatorship===\n[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 010.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Domenico Beccafumi|Beccafumi]]'s ''Ahala, Master of the Horse, Presents the Dead Maelius to Cincinnatus'', a fresco in [[Siena]]'s [[Palazzo Pubblico|Public Palace]]]]\n\nOn the nomination of his brother or nephew [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]], Cincinnatus came out of retirement for a second term as dictator in 439{{nbsp}}BC to deal with the feared plot of the wealthy plebeian [[Spurius Maelius]] to buy the loyalty of the poor and establish himself as king over Rome. Cincinnatus named [[Gaius Servilius Ahala|C. Servilius Ahala]] his [[Master of the Horse|master of the horse]] and directed him to bring Spurius Maelius before him. He and the other patricians then garrisoned the Capitoline Hill and other strongholds around the city. Maelius fended off Ahala's officer with a butcher's knife and fled into a crowd. Ahala led a band of patricians into the crowd and killed him during his flight. With the crisis resolved, Cincinnatus again resigned his commission, having served 21 days (Ahala was later brought to trial for exceeding his commission and accepted voluntary exile).{{sfnp|''AC''|1879}} Various aspects of the story are connected with dubious [[etiological myth|etiological legends]] and it may have no more connection to the dictator of 458{{nbsp}}BC than the fact that the consul for the year was a member of the same clan.{{sfnp|Forsythe|2006|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=aEfvR1Qcd0gC&pg=PA240 240]}}\n\n===Other legends===\nCincinnatus became a legend to the Romans. Twice granted supreme power, he held onto it for not a day longer than absolutely necessary. He consistently demonstrated great honorability and integrity. The high esteem in which he was held by the later Romans{{sfnp|''NSRW''|1914}} is sometimes extended to his compatriots. One legend from the end of his life claims a Capitolinus defended one of his sons from a charge of military incompetence by asking the jury who would go to tell the aged Cincinnatus the news in the event of a conviction. The son was said to have been acquitted because the jury could not bring itself to break the old man's heart.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Cincyskyline.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], the [[list of United States cities by population|29th-largest city]] in the [[United States]]<ref name=9cincy/>]]\n[[File:Paris 75001 Jardin des Tuileries - statue Cincinnatus by Denis Foyatier.jpg|thumb|200px|The statue of Cincinnatus in Paris's [[Tuileries Garden]]]]\nMany Italian cities have plazas, streets, or other locations named after Cincinnatus ({{lang-it|Cincinnato|links=no}}).
