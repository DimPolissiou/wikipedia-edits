The Bushati started to settle permanently in the 15th century and this process had been completed in the late 16th century. Their settlement includes the village of [[Bushat]] in Shkod\u00ebr in the [[Zadrima|Zadrima plain]] from where the Bushati family came. Another part settled with the tribe of [[Bukumiri]] in the would-be territory of the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe, where they gradually became part of the new, larger tribe in the late 16th century.

To promote their status and political goals statesmen, commanders and leaders from that family put forward different theories about their origins. [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] in his time recorded a story about them being descendants of a Jusuf Bey Plaku, who traced his origin and status to the era of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. In the period of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] sought to expand northwards in the old lands of [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] of the Middle Ages. In order to legitimize and strengthen his claim, he put forward another theory that he descended from [[Skenderbeg Crnojevi\u0107]], Ivan's Muslim son.<ref name=\"Slijep\u010devi\u01071983\">{{cite book|author=\u0110oko M.

The Bushati started to settle permanently in the 15th century and this process had been completed in the late 16th century. Their settlement includes the village of [[Bushat]] in Shkod\u00ebr in the [[Zadrima|Zadrima plain]] from where the Bushati family came. Another part settled with the tribe of [[Bukumiri]] in the would-be territory of the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe, where they gradually became part of the new, larger tribe in the late 16th century. In the defter of 1497 they appear as ''katun Bushat'' in Piperi with 35 households.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\">{{cite journal |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Kontribut p\u00ebr studimin e ngulitjes s\u00eb katuneve dhe krijimin e fiseve n\u00eb Shqipe \u0308rine \u0308 e veriut shekujt XV-XVI' [Contribution to the Study of Village Settlements and the Formation of the Tribes of Northern Albania in the 15th century] |journal=Studime Historike |date=1975 |volume=12 |page=87-89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4khAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha2}}</ref>\n\nThe Bushati family traces their origin the Begaj brotherhood of Bushati that had converted to Islam possibly in the early 17th century. To promote their status and political goals statesmen, commanders and leaders from that family put forward different theories about their origins. [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] in his time recorded a story about them being descendants of a Jusuf Bey Plaku, who traced his origin and status to the era of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. In the period of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] sought to expand northwards in the old lands of [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] of the Middle Ages. In order to legitimize and strengthen his claim, he put forward another theory that he descended from [[Skenderbeg Crnojevi\u0107]], Ivan's Muslim son.<ref name=\"Slijep\u010devi\u01071983\">{{cite book|author=\u0110oko M.

However, past Dexter refuses to believe he sent his sister to the past and when Dee Dee meets past Dee Dee, chaos ensues.\n__TOC__\n==Story==\nThe short starts with a clock on Dexter's desk turning to 4:00 with Dexter and Dee Dee flying in the air and a vicious roar right after. It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self. Dee Dee starts to familiarize the reoccurring events and finally remembers what's going to happen. When Dexter gives Dee Dee the message, she gives Dexter the other message and before he could say anything to the girls, they had already gone into the time machine, Dexter reminds himself again that he's doomed.

During a vacation Elango, goes home where he is forced to marry his old-fashioned cousin, Eshwari, by his tough disciplinarian father. Once back to college he hides the fact about his marriage to his friends but later the marriage becomes public when relatives of Eshwari come to visit Elango. While their dream to work together becomes true, Elango alone gets a transfer to Bombay. The friends fight but later reunite. Before Elango goes Bombay the friends force him to visit his wife and put him on a train. But Elango manages to get off the train and from there loses touch with his friends and family in the village.\n\nThe friends part and six years later Prabu and Sundar come back to join Priya and Indra in Chennai. On the train journey back, Prabu meets Elango's wife Eashwari. Prabu falls in love with Eashwari without realizing who she is. Eventually he along with his friends finds out the truth about Eashwari, who is waiting with hopes of her husband to return. The four friends decided to help Eshwari find the whereabouts of Elango. One day Prabu finds out that Elango might be in Switzerland. Prabu decides to go to Switzerland. One fine day he finds Elango but to his shocks Elango has a kid and is married to a Swiss woman. Meanwhile, in India Elango's father kills himself. Prabu goes back to India and learns that everyone knows about Elango's marriage.\n\nEshwari decides to marry again and move on with life rather than thinking about Elango. Her village people decides to marry her off to one of her relative but she threatens them telling them off that she would decide her own life and no one is going control her life anymore.

The film was initially titled ''Thithikkum Thee'' and was to feature to [[Murali (Tamil actor)|Murali]] in the lead role of a firefighter. In return for producing his first film, Shanti Thiagarajan requested Ganeshan to also work on another film starring her son [[Prashanth (actor)|Prashanth]] in the lead role and consequently, Ganeshan finalised a script titled ''Pepsi: Generation Next''.<ref>http://m.rediff.com/movies/1999/mar/26ss.htm</ref> In a turn of events, Prashanth replaced Murali in the director's first project, which was retitled as ''[[Virumbugiren]]'' in early 2000. ''Pepsi'' was later supposed to star [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]] in a lead role, but he eventually did not feature as the team opted for newcomers.<ref>http://cinematoday2.itgo.com/Hot%20News-22062001.htm</ref> [[Susi Ganeshan]], an erstwhile assistant director of [[Mani Ratnam]] announced this film in 2001 and finished in between production delays of his long-delayed film ''[[Virumbugiren]]''.\n\nFor the heroine, Susi Ganeshan spotted her on a magazine cover page and insisted on her performing the lead female role in his second feature film. Divya eventually entered the Film industry, accepting the offer, while her name was changed to Kanika. She completed the entire film during her summer holidays, since she was a student.<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/may/24sskanika.htm</ref> [[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]] who was doing college at that time saw an ad on Vijay TV that Madras Talkies was auditioning for newcomers, he applied and got selected.<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/nov/23pra.htm</ref> For other lead roles, Karthik, the son of a Tirupur businessman, [[Five Star Krishna|Krishna]], an earlier assistant to director Rajiv Menon, Sandhya, a model and also a former Ms. Chennai, and Mangaikarasi, a dancer based in Sweden. the film marked the debut of cameraman [[Ravi Varman]] in Tamil cinema.

The film was initially titled ''Thithikkum Thee'' and was to feature to [[Murali (Tamil actor)|Murali]] in the lead role of a firefighter. In return for producing his first film, Shanti Thiagarajan requested Ganeshan to also work on another film starring her son [[Prashanth (actor)|Prashanth]] in the lead role and consequently, Ganeshan finalised a script titled ''Pepsi: Generation Next''.<ref>http://m.rediff.com/movies/1999/mar/26ss.htm</ref> In a turn of events, Prashanth replaced Murali in the director's first project, which was retitled as ''[[Virumbugiren]]'' in early 2000. ''Pepsi'' was later supposed to star [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]] in a lead role, but he eventually did not feature as the team opted for newcomers.<ref>http://cinematoday2.itgo.com/Hot%20News-22062001.htm</ref> [[Susi Ganeshan]], an erstwhile assistant director of [[Mani Ratnam]] announced this film in 2001 and finished in between production delays of his long-delayed film ''[[Virumbugiren]]''.\n\nFor the heroine, Susi Ganeshan spotted her on a magazine cover page and insisted on her performing the lead female role in his second feature film. Divya eventually entered the Film industry, accepting the offer, while her name was changed to Kanika. She completed the entire film during her summer holidays, since she was a student.<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/may/24sskanika.htm</ref> [[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]] who was doing college at that time saw an ad on Vijay TV that Madras Talkies was auditioning for newcomers, he applied and got selected.<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/nov/23pra.htm</ref> For other lead roles, Karthik, the son of a Tirupur businessman, [[Five Star Krishna|Krishna]], an earlier assistant to director Rajiv Menon, Sandhya, a model and also a former Ms. Chennai, and Mangaikarasi, a dancer based in Sweden. the film marked the debut of cameraman [[Ravi Varman]] in Tamil cinema. Singer [[Anuradha Sriram]] and her husband Sriram Parasuram made their debut as music directors with this film.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20021119014118/http://www.chennaionline.com/location/5star.asp</ref>\n\nThe film had a 10-day shooting schedule at the M.I.T. College where Susi Ganesan had studied, followed by a 15-day schedule in Switzerland where some scenes and two songs were shot.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nMusic composed by [[Sriram Parasuram]] and [[Anuradha Sriram]].\n{| style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!

{"title_page": "Countertenor", "text_new": "{{short description|High classical male singing voice}}\n{{Vocal range}}\nA '''countertenor''' (also '''contra tenor''') is a type of [[classical music|classical]] male [[singing]] [[human voice|voice]] whose [[vocal range]] is equivalent to that of the female [[contralto]] or [[mezzo-soprano]] [[voice type]]s, generally extending from around [[scientific pitch notation|G<sub>3</sub>]] to D<sub>5</sub> or E<sub>5</sub>,<ref name=\":0\" /> although a [[sopranist]] (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the [[soprano]]'s range of around C<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>6</sub>.<ref name=McKinney>A sopranist is a term used to describe a countertenor whose vocal range is so high it is equivalent to that of a soprano; however, this term is widely used falsely. {{cite book\n|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults\n|last= McKinney\n|first= James\n|year= 1994\n|publisher= Genovex Music Group\n|isbn=978-1-56593-940-0}}</ref> Countertenors often are [[baritone]]s or [[tenor]]s at core, but on rare occasions use this vocal range in performance.\n\nThe nature of the countertenor voice has radically changed throughout musical history, from a [[modal voice]], to a modal and [[falsetto]] voice, to the primarily falsetto voice which is denoted by the term today. This is partly because of changes in human physiology and partly because of fluctuations in pitch.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Supernatural Voice|last=Ravens|first=Simon|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2015|isbn=9781843839620|location=Woodbridge|pages=38\u201344}}</ref>\n\nThe term first came into use in England during the mid-17th century and was in wide use by the late 17th century. However, the use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the soprano range, was known in European all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The supernatural voice : a history of high male singing|last=Simon|first=Ravens|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781843839620|location=|pages=50\u201357|oclc=967385734}}</ref> Modern-day ensembles such as [[the Tallis Scholars]] and [[the Sixteen]] have counter-tenors on alto parts in works of this period.

Although the voice has been considered largely an [[early music]] phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire.<ref name=\"Stark2003\">Stark, James (2003), ''Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy''</ref><ref name=\"Giles1982\">Giles, Peter (1982), ''The Countertenor.'' Muller Publishing</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early centuries ===\nIn [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions of the 14th and early 15th centuries, the ''contratenor'' was a voice part added to the basic two-part contrapuntal texture of discant (''[[superius]]'') and [[tenor]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tenere'' which means to hold, since this part \"held\" the music's melody, while the ''superius'' [[descant]]ed upon it at a higher pitch). Though having approximately the same range as the tenor, it was generally of a much less melodic nature than either of these other two parts. With the introduction in about 1450 of four-part writing by composers such as [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]] and [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]], the ''contratenor'' split into ''contratenor altus'' and ''contratenor bassus'', which were respectively above and below the tenor.<ref name=\"Giles1982\" /> Later the term became obsolete: in Italy, ''contratenor altus'' became simply ''altus'', in France, ''[[haute-contre]]'', and in England, countertenor. Though originally these words were used to designate a vocal part, they are now used to describe singers of that part, whose vocal techniques may differ (see below).<ref name=\"Stark2003\" />\n\nIn the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, St Paul's admonition ''\"mulieres in ecclesiis taceant\"'' (\"let the women keep silence in the churches\")<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|14:34|ASV}}</ref> still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy [[Boy soprano|treble]]s or [[alto]]s. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). However, countertenors were never used for roles in early opera, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for [[castrato|castrati]]. For example, they took several roles in the first performance of [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607). Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles; the last soprano falsettist singing in Rome, Juan [Johannes de] San[c]tos (a Spaniard), died in 1652.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/~rsherr/frmst1.htm|title=SingerList|website=sophia.smith.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326004513/http://sophia.smith.edu/~rsherr/frmst1.htm|archivedate=26 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Italian opera]], by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated,<ref>During the first half of the century, some falsettist altos, such as  Lorenzino Sances and [[Mario Savioni]], happened to appear onstage, especially in Rome.</ref> while in France, the modal high tenor, called the ''haute-contre'',<ref>the nature of the ''haute-contre'' voice has been the subject of much debate, but it is now generally accepted that ''haute-contres'' sang in what voice scientists term \"[[Modal voice|modal]]\", perhaps using [[falsetto]] or ''[[falsettone]]'' for their highest notes (cf.

Such is the case in ''[[Hail!

Later in the same work, Purcell's own manuscript designates the same singer, Mr Howel, described as \"a High Contra tenor\" to perform in the range G<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>; it is very likely that he took some of the lowest notes in a well-blended \"chest voice\"&nbsp;\u2013 see below).\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\"The Purcell counter-tenor 'tenor' did not flourish in England much beyond the early years of the [eighteenth] century; within twenty years of Purcell's death [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] had settled in London and ''[[opera seria]]'', which was underpinned entirely by Italian singing, soon became entrenched in British theatres\".<ref name=\"Potter\"/> In parallel, by Handel's time, castrati had come to dominate the English operatic stage as much as that of Italy (and indeed most of Europe outside France). They also took part in several of Handel's oratorios, though countertenors, too, occasionally featured as soloists in the latter, the parts written for them being closer in compass to the higher ones of Purcell, with a usual range of A<sub>3</sub> to E<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=\"Giles1982\" /> They also sang the alto parts in Handel's choruses. It was as choral singers within the Anglican church tradition (as well as in the secular genre of the [[Glee (music)|glee]]) that countertenors survived as performers throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Otherwise they largely faded from public notice.<ref name=\"Stark2003\" />\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe most visible person of the countertenor revival in the twentieth century was [[Alfred Deller]], an English singer and champion of authentic early music performance. Deller initially identified as an \"alto\", but his collaborator [[Michael Tippett]] recommended the archaic term \"countertenor\" to describe his voice.<ref name=\"Giles1982\" /> In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the [[Deller Consort]], was important in increasing audiences' awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. [[Benjamin Britten]] wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten's ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'' (1973) was created by [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. [[Russell Oberlin]] was Deller's American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin's success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him.<ref name=\"Giles2005\">Giles, Peter (2005), ''A Basic Countertenor Method''</ref> Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgrPBTRjMk|title=Russell Oberlin explica o que \u00e9 um contratenor|website=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316010040/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgrPBTRjMk|archive-date=16 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nToday, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some [[Breeches role|trouser roles]] originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous and includes Orfeo in [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' and ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]'', and Bertarido in ''Rodelinda''.<ref name=\"Stark2003\" /> [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] also had castrati roles in his early operas, including Amintas in ''[[Il re pastore]]'' and Cecilio in ''[[Lucio Silla]]''.\n\nMany modern composers other than Britten have written, and continue to write, countertenor parts, both in choral works and opera, as well as songs and song-cycles for the voice. Men's choral groups such as [[Chanticleer (ensemble)|Chanticleer]] and [[The King's Singers]] employ the voice to great effect in a variety of genres, including early music, gospel, and even folk songs. Other recent operatic parts written for the countertenor voice include Edgar in [[Aribert Reimann]]'s ''[[Lear (opera)|Lear]]'' (1978), the messenger in his ''[[Medea (Reimann)|Medea]]'' (2010), the title role in [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]'' (1983), Claire in [[John Lunn]]'s ''The Maids'' (1998), the Refugee in [[Jonathan Dove]]'s ''[[Flight (opera)|Flight]]'' (1998), Trinculo in [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]]'s ''[[The Tempest (opera)|The Tempest]]'' (2004), the Boy in [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]]'s ''[[Written on Skin]]'' (2012) and several others (see [[Countertenor#Roles in opera|Roles in opera]] below).\n\n== Voice type ==\n[[File:Countertenor voice range on keyboard.svg|thumb|400px|Countertenor vocal range (E<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>) notated on the [[treble clef|treble]] [[staff (music)|staff]] (left) and on piano keyboard in green with dot marking middle C (C4)]]\n{| align=right\n|<score>{ \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" } \\clef treble e4 e''4 }</score>\n|}\nThe [[vocal range]] of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female [[contralto]] or [[mezzo-soprano]] [[voice type]]s.

''The Science of Vocal Pedagogy: Theory and Application''</ref> [[Peter Giles (countertenor)|Peter Giles]], a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism.  In modern usage, the term \"countertenor\" is essentially equivalent to the medieval term ''contratenor altus'' (see above).  In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed.<ref name=\"Giles2005\" /> The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G<sub>3</sub> to D<sub>5</sub> or E<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=\":0\">[[J. B. Steane]], \"Countertenor\", in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', I, p. 999.</ref> In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used.  In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a [[falsetto]] vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of \"chest voice\" (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes.  The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub>) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed.<ref name=\"Giles2005\" />\n\nIn response to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register \"[[head voice]].\"<ref name=\"Giles2005\" /> Many voice experts{{who|date=November 2017}} would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation \"head voice\" for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production.  The latter type of head voice is, in terms of the vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to \"chest voice\" than to falsetto, since it uses the same \"speaking voice\" production (referred to as \"modal\" by voice scientists), and this is reflected in the timbre.<ref name=\"Appelman1986\" />\n\n== Terminology ==\nParticularly in the British choral tradition, the terms \"male soprano\" and \"male alto\" serve to identify men who rely on falsetto vocal production, rather than the [[modal voice]], to sing in the soprano or alto vocal range. Elsewhere, the terms have less universal currency. Some authorities do accept them as descriptive of male falsettists, although this view is subject to controversy;<ref>Ardran and Wulstan in their article \"The Alto or Countertenor Voice\" (''[[Music & Letters]]'', vol. 48/1, January 1967) agree with the view of Giles noted below; others disagree strongly&nbsp;\u2013 see, for example, [[Neal Zaslaw]]: \"The enigma of the Haute-Contre\" (''[[The Musical Times]]'', vol. 115, no. 1581 (November 1974), pp. 939-941); Mary Cyr: \"On performing 18th-century haute-contre roles\" (''The Musical Times'', vol. 118, April 1977); Simon Ravens: \"A sweet shrill voice : The countertenor and vocal scoring in Tudor England\" (''[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]'' 1998; XXVI: 123-136).</ref> they would reserve the term \"countertenor\" for men who, like [[Russell Oberlin]], achieve a soprano range voice with little or no falsetto, equating it with ''haute-contre'' and the Italian ''tenor altino''.<ref>Giles, \"liberal\" in his use of the word countertenor, proposes this latter term for such voices</ref> Adherents to this view maintain that a countertenor will have unusually short vocal cords<ref name=\"Stark2003\" /> and consequently a higher speaking voice and lower range and tessitura than their falsettist counterparts, perhaps from D<sub>3</sub> to D<sub>5</sub>. Operatic vocal classification, on the other hand, prefers the terms \"countertenor\" and \"[[sopranist]]\" to \"male soprano\" and \"male alto,\" and some scholars consider the latter two terms inaccurate owing to physiological differences between male and female vocal production.<ref name=McKinney /> The only known man who can claim to be a true male soprano by that definition is [[Michael Maniaci]], whose modal voice falls in the soprano range, akin to a woman's, because his larynx did not develop fully in puberty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece|title=The Times & The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517072513/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Roles in opera ==\nNotable countertenor roles include:\n{{div col|colwidth=25em|rules=yes}}\n*Adone, ''[[La catena d'Adone]]'' ([[Domenico Mazzocchi]])\n*Atlante, Alceste, ''[[Il palazzo incantato]]'' ([[Luigi Rossi]])\n*Joad, ''[[Athalia (Handel)|Athalia]]''  ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]])\n*La Fortuna,<ref>Questioned.

Though having approximately the same range as the tenor, it was generally of a much less melodic nature than either of these other two parts. With the introduction in about 1450 of four-part writing by composers such as [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]] and [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]], the ''contratenor'' split into ''contratenor altus'' and ''contratenor bassus'', which were respectively above and below the tenor.<ref name=\"Giles1982\" /> Later the term became obsolete: in Italy, ''contratenor altus'' became simply ''altus'', in France, ''[[haute-contre]]'', and in England, countertenor. Though originally these words were used to designate a vocal part, they are now used to describe singers of that part, whose vocal techniques may differ (see below).<ref name=\"Stark2003\" />\n\nIn the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, St Paul's admonition ''\"mulieres in ecclesiis taceant\"'' (\"let the women keep silence in the churches\")<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|14:34|ASV}}</ref> still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy [[Boy soprano|treble]]s or [[alto]]s. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). However, countertenors were never used for roles in early opera, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for [[castrato|castrati]]. For example, they took several roles in the first performance of [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607). Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles; the last soprano falsettist singing in Rome, Juan [Johannes de] San[c]tos (a Spaniard), died in 1652.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/~rsherr/frmst1.htm|title=SingerList|website=sophia.smith.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326004513/http://sophia.smith.edu/~rsherr/frmst1.htm|archivedate=26 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Italian opera]], by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated,<ref>During the first half of the century, some falsettist altos, such as  Lorenzino Sances and [[Mario Savioni]], happened to appear onstage, especially in Rome.</ref> while in France, the modal high tenor, called the ''haute-contre'',<ref>the nature of the ''haute-contre'' voice has been the subject of much debate, but it is now generally accepted that ''haute-contres'' sang in what voice scientists term \"[[Modal voice|modal]]\", perhaps using [[falsetto]] or ''[[falsettone]]'' for their highest notes (cf.

Later in the same work, Purcell's own manuscript designates the same singer, Mr Howel, described as \"a High Contra tenor\" to perform in the range G<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>; it is very likely that he took some of the lowest notes in a well-blended \"chest voice\"&nbsp;\u2013 see below).\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\"The Purcell counter-tenor 'tenor' did not flourish in England much beyond the early years of the [eighteenth] century; within twenty years of Purcell's death [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] had settled in London and ''[[opera seria]]'', which was underpinned entirely by Italian singing, soon became entrenched in British theatres\".<ref name=\"Potter\"/> In parallel, by Handel's time, castrati had come to dominate the English operatic stage as much as that of Italy (and indeed most of Europe outside France). They also took part in several of Handel's oratorios, though countertenors, too, occasionally featured as soloists in the latter, the parts written for them being closer in compass to the higher ones of Purcell, with a usual range of A<sub>3</sub> to E<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=\"Giles1982\" /> They also sang the alto parts in Handel's choruses. It was as choral singers within the Anglican church tradition (as well as in the secular genre of the [[Glee (music)|glee]]) that countertenors survived as performers throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Otherwise they largely faded from public notice.<ref name=\"Stark2003\" />\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe most visible person of the countertenor revival in the twentieth century was [[Alfred Deller]], an English singer and champion of authentic early music performance. Deller initially identified as an \"alto\", but his collaborator [[Michael Tippett]] recommended the archaic term \"countertenor\" to describe his voice.<ref name=\"Giles1982\" /> In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the [[Deller Consort]], was important in increasing audiences' awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. [[Benjamin Britten]] wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten's ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'' (1973) was created by [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. [[Russell Oberlin]] was Deller's American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin's success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him.<ref name=\"Giles2005\">Giles, Peter (2005), ''A Basic Countertenor Method''</ref> Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgrPBTRjMk|title=Russell Oberlin explica o que \u00e9 um contratenor|website=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316010040/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgrPBTRjMk|archive-date=16 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nToday, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some [[Breeches role|trouser roles]] originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous and includes Orfeo in [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' and ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]'', and Bertarido in ''Rodelinda''.<ref name=\"Stark2003\" /> [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] also had castrati roles in his early operas, including Amintas in ''[[Il re pastore]]'' and Cecilio in ''[[Lucio Silla]]''.\n\nMany modern composers other than Britten have written, and continue to write, countertenor parts, both in choral works and opera, as well as songs and song-cycles for the voice. Men's choral groups such as [[Chanticleer (ensemble)|Chanticleer]] and [[The King's Singers]] employ the voice to great effect in a variety of genres, including early music, gospel, and even folk songs. Other recent operatic parts written for the countertenor voice include Edgar in [[Aribert Reimann]]'s ''[[Lear (opera)|Lear]]'' (1978), the messenger in his ''[[Medea (Reimann)|Medea]]'' (2010), the title role in [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]'' (1983), Claire in [[John Lunn]]'s ''The Maids'' (1998), the Refugee in [[Jonathan Dove]]'s ''[[Flight (opera)|Flight]]'' (1998), Trinculo in [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]]'s ''[[The Tempest (opera)|The Tempest]]'' (2004), the Boy in [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]]'s ''[[Written on Skin]]'' (2012) and several others (see [[Countertenor#Roles in opera|Roles in opera]] below).\n\n== Voice type ==\n[[File:Countertenor voice range on keyboard.svg|thumb|400px|Countertenor vocal range (E<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>) notated on the [[treble clef|treble]] [[staff (music)|staff]] (left) and on piano keyboard in green with dot marking middle C (C4)]]\n{| align=right\n|<score>{ \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" } \\clef treble e4 e''4 }</score>\n|}\nThe [[vocal range]] of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female [[contralto]] or [[mezzo-soprano]] [[voice type]]s. A trained countertenor will typically have a vocal center similar in placement to that of a contralto or mezzo-soprano.<ref name=\"Appelman1986\">Appelman, D. Ralph (1986). ''The Science of Vocal Pedagogy: Theory and Application''</ref> [[Peter Giles (countertenor)|Peter Giles]], a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism.  In modern usage, the term \"countertenor\" is essentially equivalent to the medieval term ''contratenor altus'' (see above).  In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed.<ref name=\"Giles2005\" /> The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G<sub>3</sub> to D<sub>5</sub> or E<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=\":0\">[[J. B. Steane]], \"Countertenor\", in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', I, p. 999.</ref> In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used.  In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a [[falsetto]] vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of \"chest voice\" (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes.  The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub>) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed.<ref name=\"Giles2005\" />\n\nIn response to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register \"[[head voice]].\"<ref name=\"Giles2005\" /> Many voice experts{{who|date=November 2017}} would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation \"head voice\" for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production.  The latter type of head voice is, in terms of the vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to \"chest voice\" than to falsetto, since it uses the same \"speaking voice\" production (referred to as \"modal\" by voice scientists), and this is reflected in the timbre.<ref name=\"Appelman1986\" />\n\n== Terminology ==\nParticularly in the British choral tradition, the terms \"male soprano\" and \"male alto\" serve to identify men who rely on falsetto vocal production, rather than the [[modal voice]], to sing in the soprano or alto vocal range. Elsewhere, the terms have less universal currency. Some authorities do accept them as descriptive of male falsettists, although this view is subject to controversy;<ref>Ardran and Wulstan in their article \"The Alto or Countertenor Voice\" (''[[Music & Letters]]'', vol. 48/1, January 1967) agree with the view of Giles noted below; others disagree strongly&nbsp;\u2013 see, for example, [[Neal Zaslaw]]: \"The enigma of the Haute-Contre\" (''[[The Musical Times]]'', vol. 115, no. 1581 (November 1974), pp. 939-941); Mary Cyr: \"On performing 18th-century haute-contre roles\" (''The Musical Times'', vol. 118, April 1977); Simon Ravens: \"A sweet shrill voice : The countertenor and vocal scoring in Tudor England\" (''[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]'' 1998; XXVI: 123-136).</ref> they would reserve the term \"countertenor\" for men who, like [[Russell Oberlin]], achieve a soprano range voice with little or no falsetto, equating it with ''haute-contre'' and the Italian ''tenor altino''.<ref>Giles, \"liberal\" in his use of the word countertenor, proposes this latter term for such voices</ref> Adherents to this view maintain that a countertenor will have unusually short vocal cords<ref name=\"Stark2003\" /> and consequently a higher speaking voice and lower range and tessitura than their falsettist counterparts, perhaps from D<sub>3</sub> to D<sub>5</sub>. Operatic vocal classification, on the other hand, prefers the terms \"countertenor\" and \"[[sopranist]]\" to \"male soprano\" and \"male alto,\" and some scholars consider the latter two terms inaccurate owing to physiological differences between male and female vocal production.<ref name=McKinney /> The only known man who can claim to be a true male soprano by that definition is [[Michael Maniaci]], whose modal voice falls in the soprano range, akin to a woman's, because his larynx did not develop fully in puberty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece|title=The Times & The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517072513/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article2638744.ece|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Roles in opera ==\nNotable countertenor roles include:\n{{div col|colwidth=25em|rules=yes}}\n*Adone, ''[[La catena d'Adone]]'' ([[Domenico Mazzocchi]])\n*Atlante, Alceste, ''[[Il palazzo incantato]]'' ([[Luigi Rossi]])\n*Joad, ''[[Athalia (Handel)|Athalia]]''  ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]])\n*La Fortuna,<ref>Questioned.
