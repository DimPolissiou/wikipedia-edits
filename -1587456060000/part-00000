It was manufactured by the Japanese [[optics]] company Nippon Kogaku K. K. ([[Nikon Corporation]] since 1988) in Japan from September 1971 to 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217025948/http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |archive-date=17 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It used a horizontal-travel [[focal plane shutter]] with titanium shutter curtains and a speed range of 1 to 1/2000 second (up to 10 seconds using the self-timer) plus Bulb and Time, and flash X-sync of 1/80 second. It had dimensions (with DE-1 head, see below) of 98&nbsp;mm height, 152.5&nbsp;mm width, 65&nbsp;mm depth and 730 g weight. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.\n\nThe F2 is the second member of the long line of Nikon F-series professional-level 35&nbsp;mm SLRs that began with the [[Nikon F]] (manufactured 1959\u20131974) and followed each other in a sort of dynastic succession as the top-of-the-line Nikon camera. The other members were the [[Nikon F3|F3]] (1980\u20132001), [[Nikon F4|F4]] (1988\u20131996), [[Nikon F5|F5]] (1996\u20132005) and [[Nikon F6|F6]] (2004\u2013present). The F-series do not share any major components except for the all-important bayonet lens mount ('F mount').\n\nAll Nikon professional F-series SLRs are full [[system camera]]s. This means that each camera body serves as only a modular hub.\n<gallery>\nFile:Nikon F2 body front.jpg|F2S\nFile:Nikon F2 body back open.jpg|F2S, open film door\nFile:F2-titan-11.jpg|F2 \u2013 bayonet F-mount\nFile:Nikon F2 SB SLR camera with GN Auto Nikkor 2,8 f=45mm lens.JPG|Nikon F2SB with DP-3 prism and GN Auto Nikkor 1:2,8 f=45mm lens\nFile:F2-titan-5.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\nFile:F2-titan-7.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\n</gallery>\n\n==Features==\nThe Nikon F2 is an all-metal, mechanically-controlled (springs, gears, levers), manual focus SLR with manual exposure control. The camera itself needed no batteries, though the prism [[light meter]] did (and of course the motor drive if added). The F2 replaced the Nikon F, adding many new features (a faster 1/2000-second maximum shutter speed, a swing open back for easier film loading, a wider assortment of detachable finders and metering heads, a 250 exposure film back, a larger reflex mirror to ensure no vignetting, and a shutter release nearer the front of the camera for better ergonomics). It also offered a detachable motor drive, something the F only had as a custom modification. It was the last all-mechanical professional-level Nikon SLR.\n\n==Lenses==\nThe F2 accepts all lenses with the [[Nikon F-mount|Nikon F bayonet mount]] (introduced in 1959 on the Nikon F camera), with certain limitations or exceptions depending on the F2 version. The later F2A and F2AS Photomic variants (see below) require lenses supporting the Automatic maximum aperture Indexing (AI) feature (introduced in 1977). The manual focus Nippon Kogaku made AI lenses were the Nikkor AI-S, Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E types. The AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. The original Nikkor \"non-AI\" (introduced before 1977) lenses, will mount but require stop down metering. Nippon Kogaku had a service to retrofit non-AI lenses with a new aperture ring with the AI feature to produce \"AI'd\" lenses, but this service ended decades ago.\n\nThe older F2, F2S and F2SB Photomic variants (see below) require lenses with a \"meter coupling shoe\" (or prong, informally called \"rabbit ears\" by photography enthusiasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cameragx.com/2009/09/17/a-history-of-slr-cameras-in-50-years-of-bayonet-evolution-part-ii-of-vi/|title=50 years of lens mount evolution (Part II of VI)|date=17 September 2009}}</ref> These lenses are the Nikkor non-AI, AI'd Nikkor, Nikkor AI and Nikkor AI-S types. Lenses without rabbit ears, such as the Nikon Series E, AF Nikkor, AF Nikkor D, AF-I Nikkor and AF-S Nikkor types, will mount but require stop down metering.\n\nThe F2 with plain/eye-level DE-1 prism (no light meter; see below) will work with either lens types. Note that the Nikkor AI-S and Nikkor AI types are AI types plus have rabbit ears and will function properly on all Nikon F2 variants.\n\nNikon's most recent 35mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (2000) lacking an aperture control ring; and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's DX digital SLRs, will mount but will not function properly. A few exotic fisheye lenses from the 1960s require mirror lock-up and therefore an auxiliary viewfinder is preferred. IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's [[Advanced Photo System]] (APS) film SLRs, must not be mounted on any F2, as their rear elements will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage even with the mirror locked up.\n\nIn 1977 Nippon Kogaku made about 55 non-AI and AI lenses, ranging from a '''Fisheye-Nikkor 6&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' 220\u00b0 circular fisheye to a '''Reflex-Nikkor 2000&nbsp;mm f/11''' super-long mirror telephoto. This was the largest lens selection in the world by far.\n\nThe standard lens for most professionals was the '''Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4''', but some preferred the '''Nikkor 35&nbsp;mm f/2''' with a wider field of view for grab shots. The '''Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/2.5''' was renowned for its superb sharpness and [[bokeh]] and was a favorite for head-and-shoulders portraits (\"head shots\").\n\nSpecial purpose lenses included the '''Micro-Nikkors 55&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' and '''55&nbsp;mm f/2.8''', '''Micro-Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/4''' for close-up \"macro\" photography, the '''Noct-Nikkor 58&nbsp;mm f/1.2''' for low light photography, the '''PC-Nikkor 28&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' shifting perspective control lens, the '''GN-Nikkor 45&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' for automatically setting the proper aperture for flash exposure based on distance (also useful as a very small/light \"pancake\" lens), the '''[[Nikkor 13mm f/5.6]]''' widest angle (118\u00b0) rectilinear lens for SLRs ever made, the '''Nikkor 300&nbsp;mm f/2.8 ED IF''' fast telephoto useful for sports and wildlife photography, the versatile, but heavy '''Zoom-Nikkor 50\u2013300&nbsp;mm f/4.5 ED''' and the quick framing, but notoriously middling optical-quality '''Zoom-Nikkor 43\u201386&nbsp;mm f/3.5'''.\n\nThere were innumerable independent manufacturer lenses available in the Nikon F mount. The most famous was probably the [[Vivitar]] Series 1 70\u2013210&nbsp;mm f/3.5 Macro Zoom (released 1974), the first independent zoom lens to meet most professional photographers' quality standards.\n\n==Viewfinders==\nHowever, it was the F2's interchangeable viewfinders (also known as \"heads\")<ref>[http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/d-archives/history-f2/index.htm Nikon Article on F2's Debut], Nikon</ref> that marked it as a truly professional-level SLR and was its greatest strength. By providing updated heads every few years, Nippon Kogaku was able to introduce new versions of the F2 and keep the basic body in the latest technology until production ended in 1980. Note that F2 heads were often sold separately from the body, mostly in black finish with about 10% in chrome, and it is therefore not unusual to see body/head combinations with mismatched serial numbers and/or colors.\n\nThe head on the basic Nikon F2 was called the '''Nikon DE-1'''. It provided a virtually 100% accurate viewing image, but was a plain pentaprism eyelevel viewing head with no built-in light meter and so had no metering or exposure information display, except for a flash-ready light. Unlike the other heads, about 90% of DE-1s were chrome finished. It was unpopular because of the lack of a built-in meter, but remained available for the life of the F2. F2 bodies with DE-1 finders maintain the highest prices on the secondary market.\n\nIf a pentaprism head with a built-in light meter was mounted on the F2, the camera became an F2 Photomic. However, since Nippon Kokagu made five different metering heads over the life of the F2, there were five different F2 Photomic versions. The use of any Photomic head requires that batteries (two S76 or A76, or SR44 or LR44) be installed in the F2 body to power the head's electronics.\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 and DP-2.jpg|thumb|Nikon DP-1 and DP-2 viewfinders]]\nThe original '''Nikon F2 Photomic''', packaged with the '''Nikon DP-1''' head, was manufactured from 1971 to 1977. The DP-1 had a center-the-needle exposure control system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving between horizontally arranged +/\u2013 over/underexposure markers at the bottom of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the photographer's actual camera selections. Flanking the needle array on the left and right were a readout of the camera set f-stop and shutter speed, respectively. The needle array was duplicated on the top of the DP-1 head to allow exposure control without looking through the viewfinder. A Nikon F2 Photomic with Nikkor-S 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $660 in 1972. Note that SLRs usually sold for 30 to 40 percent below list price.\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|Needle lightmeter on DP-1]]\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-2 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|LED lightmeter on DP-2]]\n[[Image:F2s.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Nikon F2s using the DP-2 viewfinder]]\nManufactured from 1973 to 1977, the '''F2S Photomic''' used the '''DP-2''' head. Although it looked very different, the DP-2 was functionally very similar to the DP-1. It substituted an all-solid-state light-both-LEDs exposure control system using two arrow-shaped [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) over/underexposure indicators for better visibility in low light situations and better overall reliability. This was important, because the DP-2's CdS meter had better low-light sensitivity than the DP-1\u2014down to Exposure Value (EV) \u22122, instead of EV 1, at ASA 100. A chrome Nikon F2S Photomic with Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $961 in 1976. Note: SLRs were usually discounted 30 to 40 percent from list.\n\nWith the '''DP-3''' head, the camera became the '''F2SB Photomic''', available 1976 to 1977. The DP-3 introduced three innovations: a silicon photodiode light meter (a first for Nikon SLRs) for faster and more accurate light readings, a five-stage center-the-LED exposure control system using +/o/\u2212 LEDs, and an eyepiece blind.\n\nThese three early Photomic heads required Nikon F-mount lenses with a meter coupling shoe (\"rabbit ears\", see above). Rabbit ear lenses required a special mounting procedure. After mounting, the lens aperture ring must be turned back and forth to the smallest aperture (largest f-stop number) and then to the largest aperture (smallest f-stop number) to ensure that the lens and the head couple properly (Nippon Kogaku called it indexing the maximum aperture of the lens\u2014users called it the Nikon Shuffle!) and meter correctly. This system seems unwieldy to today's photographers, but it was second nature to Nikon and [[Nikkormat]] camera using photographers of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Image:Nikon-F2AS.jpg|thumb|A black body F2AS (incl DP-12 prism, as seen here) was very popular among photojournalists in the 1970s.]]\n[[Image:F2AScloseup.jpg|thumb|250|An F2AS (incl DP-12 prism). The EV metering range is a remarkable -2 to 17 with 100 ASA film.]]\nThe '''F2A Photomic''' came with the '''DP-11''' head; the '''F2AS Photomic''' used the '''DP-12''' head. The DP-11 and DP-12 (both introduced in 1977) functioned exactly the same as the DP-1 and DP-3, respectively, except that these heads supported Nikkor lenses with the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (introduced 1977, see above). Nikkor AI lenses had a \"meter coupling ridge\" cam on the lens aperture ring that pushed on a spring-loaded \"meter coupling lever\" on the Photomic head to transfer aperture setting information. AI lenses allowed carefree lens mounting and ended the double twisting that used to allow observers to spot a Nikon/Nikkormat user from a hundred paces. The F2AS Photomic (DP-12 head) was the most advanced F2 version and the chrome version with Nikkor AI 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $1,278 in 1978. (SLR selling prices were typically 30 to 40 percent below list.) This, the last version of the Nikon F2 Photomic, has become the most desired and collected F2 today.\n\nThe F2S Photomic (DP-2 head) and F2SB Photomic (DP-3 head) also accepted the unusual '''Nikon DS-1''' or '''DS-2 EE Aperture Control Units'''. The F2AS (DP-12) required the equivalent '''DS-12'''. These were early attempts by Nippon Kogaku to provide shutter priority autoexposure by having an electric servomotor automatically turn the lens aperture ring in response to the set shutter speed and light meter reading. The DS-1, -2 and -12 were bulky, slow and unreliable, and were feeble and inelegant attempts to add autoexposure to the manual exposure F2.\n\nThere were also three special purpose meterless heads available for the F2: the '''Nikon DW-1''' waist-level finder (a non-pentaprism head; look down directly at the mirror-reversed image on the focusing screen), the '''DA-1''' action finder (providing 60&nbsp;mm of eye relief; extremely large exit pupil that can be viewed while wearing face masks, safety goggles, etc.) and the '''DW-2''' 6X magnifying finder (waist-level finder with magnifier; good for precise focusing).\n\n==Focusing screens==\nThe F2 also had interchangeable viewfinder focusing screens. Nippon Kogaku's standard '''Type K''' screen had central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder and 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12&nbsp;mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.\n\nThe optional screens were:\n*'''Type A''' \u2013 central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Standard equipment with early F2s. Changeover to Type K occurred circa 1976.\n*'''Type B''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm focusing spot plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Useful for close ups and long telephotos.\n*'''Type C''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm clear spot with crosshair reticle. Very bright and useful for photo-microscopy, astrophotography, and parallax focusing method.\n*'''Type D''' \u2013 plain matte screen. Best screen for use with long telephotos with small apertures.\n*'''Type E''' \u2013 Type B with a grid of 5 horizontal and 3 vertical lines. Called \"architectural screen\" and excellent for \"Rule of Thirds\" pictorialist compositions. The most popular replacement screen.\n*'''Type G''' \u2013 central 12&nbsp;mm extra-bright microprism without matte background (cannot assess depth of field). Four versions (G1\u2013G4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type H''' \u2013 fullscreen extra-bright microprism; also cannot assess depth of field. Four versions (H1\u2013H4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Intended for sports photography, but not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type J''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm microprism plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle.\n*'''Type L''' \u2013 Type A, but with rangefinder set at a 45\u00b0 angle from lower left to upper right. Permits focusing on horizontal or vertical subjects.\n*'''Type M''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm double cross hairs with marked horizontal and vertical scales. Excellent for photo-microscopy.\n*'''Type P''' \u2013 Type L, but adds 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar and fullscreen crosshair. Originally marketed as the \"Apollo P screen,\" it was a screen favored by NASA on the bodies they acquired for their use.\n*'''Type R''' \u2013 Type E, but adds a 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder to the center of the screen.\n*'''Type S''' \u2013 for F2 Data (see below) only. Type A with etched marking for data imprint area.\n*'''Type T''' \u2013 for F2 Type A with etched markings for taking pictures of TV screens.\nThe combination and wide selection of heads and screens allowed photographers to customize their F2s to their heart's content.\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive.jpg|thumb|Nikon MD-2 motor drive back without camera]]\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive front.jpg|thumb|MD-2 motor drive front with camera]]\nMajor accessories for the F2 included the '''Nikon MD-1''' (introduced in 1971) and '''MD-2''' (1973) [[motor drive]]s, providing automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second, 6 if the mirror was locked up, plus power rewind. They both required a '''Nikon MB-1''' battery pack holding 10 AA or LR6 batteries in two '''Nikon MS-1''' battery clips. Note that the 5 frame/s rate required that the F2 have its mirror locked up and the MD-1 or -2 be loaded with two '''Nikon MN-1''' nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. (These batteries are long since dead.) With the mirror operating, the maximum advance rate is 4.3 frame/s; with AAs, the rate is 4 frame/s. The addition of the MD-1 or MD-2 greatly increased the overall weight of the camera. With a fully loaded MD-2/MB-1 and 50mm lens, the F2 would weigh in at just over six pounds.\n\nThe F2 also accepted the lighter, cheaper and less capable '''Nikon MD-3''' motor drive. The MD-3 did not have power rewind and had an advance rate of 2.5 frame/s with the standard '''MB-2''' battery pack holding 8 AA or LR6 batteries. Optionally, it could reach 3.5 frame/s with an MB-1 battery pack with 10 AA or LR6 batteries; 4 frame/s with MB-1 and MN-1 nicad battery.\n\nThe F2 could also mount the '''Nikon MF-1''' (33/10 feet/meters film = 250 frames; required two '''Nikon MZ-1''' film cassettes) and '''MF-2''' (100/30 feet/meters film = 750 frames; required two '''MZ-2''' film cassettes) bulk film backs. These were very useful if a photographer had a motor drive mounted and needed to take more than seven seconds' worth of photographs. Note that the MF-2 and its MZ-2 cassettes are very rare.\n\nStarting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku introduced the '''Nikon Speedlight SB-2''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-5''' (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-6''' (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and '''SB-7E''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) [[electronic flash]]es. Note that the F2 did not use a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can be connected to the Nikon shoe via the '''Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler'''.\n\nThe '''Nikon ML-1 Modulite''' was a wireless infrared remote controller with a 200/60 feet/meters line-of-sight range. It was a two part device: a handheld transmitter plus a camera mounted receiver. Note that the receiver needed to be connected to a motor drive. The '''Nikon MW-1''' was a similar device, but was larger and more powerful and used radio signals for a longer 2300/700 feet/meters obstructed view range. The MW-1 could also control three separate F2s by broadcasting three different codes.\n\nThe '''Nikon MT-1''' intervalometer allowed completely untended time lapse photography. It could fire the F2 for a specific number of frames at a particular shutter speed at set time intervals.\n\nNippon Kogaku also made scores of minor accessories for the F2, such as straps, cases, bags, remote firing cords, eyecups, eyepiece correction lenses, supplementary close-up lenses, lens hoods, filters and cases. In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced in excess of US$110,000\u2014the most extensive and expensive in the world.\n\n==Special F2 Versions==\nThere were several special purpose versions of the F2 manufactured in small numbers. Although they were all working cameras, today they are all rare collector's items.\n\n[[File:F2 titan noname.jpg|thumb|150px|F2 T]]\nThe '''F2T''' was a special ultra-rugged version of the F2 (DE-1 head) with [[titanium]] bayonet mount, top and bottom plates, and camera back, plus a special '''DE-1T''' titanium covered meterless prism head, sold in parallel with the regular F2s from 1978 to 1980. Most F2Ts were given a special textured black finish but a very few came in natural titanium finish, including the first F2Ts and the very last F2s ever manufactured. Their serial numbers began with '92', e.g., \"F2 9201544.'\n\nThe '''F2 Titan''' was a black only late variant of the F2T, distinguished by the word \"Titan\" engraved in Roman script on the front of the camera below the shutter release. They carry the number 79 in front of the serial number.\n\nThe H in the '''F2H''' of 1978 denoted \"High Speed\". It was yet another titanium-armored F2 but this time with a fixed (not reflex), semi-silvered, pellicle mirror, manual lens diaphragm control and a mechanically matched titanium-armored '''Nikon MD-100''' high-speed motor drive. The maximum shutter speed is 1/1000 (vs. 1/2000 for other F2 models). The self-timer and shutter settings 'B' and 'T' were omitted. The depth-of-field preview button was replaced with a 'Full-Aperture Viewing Button'. The Nikon MD-100 motor drive was a modified version of the MD-2 motor drive and was powered by the Nikon MB-100. The MB-100 consists of two MB-1 battery packs (20 AA or LR6 batteries, or four Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, providing 30 volts), weighing a massive 960 g empty and reaching 10 frames-per-second film advance rate. The F2H set included the Nikon MH-100 battery charger. All components (body, motor and batterypack) may be detached from each other. The bodies (7-digit serial number) and motordrives (6-digit serial number) do not have matching serial numbers, contrary to often repeated misinformation. Body serial numbers began with 7850001, e.g. 'F2 7850001'. Approximately 400 units were produced making the F2H extremely rare, the rarest of any 'production model' F2, and valuable.\n\nAs the name implies, the '''F2 Data''' had a primitive data back. It used a tiny internal flash unit to imprint the time, date or sequential number on the film. This data back recorded the time by imprinting a tiny picture of a slightly less tiny [[Seiko]] made analogue clock onto the film. It also had a special insert plate that the photographer could write on and have this note imprinted on the film. There were two versions of the F2 Data: one with the '''MF-10''' camera back for standard 35&nbsp;mm film cartridges and one with the '''MF-11''' 250 frame bulk film back. The F2 Data also came packaged with an MD-2 motor drive and your choice of DE-1, DP-11 or DP-12 head plus a special Type S focusing screen that marked the left-side data imprint area. F2 Data bodies carry the numbers '77' in front of the serial number. Approximately 5,000 units were produced.\n\nFinally there was the '''F2A Anniversary''' model. This was marketed as a collector's item of 4,000 specially numbered bodies intended to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Nikon cameras in the USA. A plate was glued to the front of the camera below the shutter release noting, \"25th Anniversary\" (which has fallen off many bodies) and came in a special silver-colored box. The F2A Anniversary was not authorized by Nippon Kogaku; it was the creation of the American importer, Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries (EPOI).\n\n==Current status==\nBecause of the F2's durability, because there were so many manufactured (816,000 units) and because film SLRs have been largely replaced with digital equivalents in many markets, the F2 is still relatively common today and is available on the used market for low prices\u2014US$200\u2013400<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2.html Nikon F2 completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref> depending on the head. However, these may be well worn examples used by professional photographers and are generally in mediocre condition.\n\nThe Nikon F2 is also collectable. If a pristine F2 body and head with date-compatible serial numbers is found, it will carry collector's items price tags. The black body version of the F2AS model, in near new condition, can exceed $1,100 at auction.<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2AS.html Nikon F2 AS completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*\"Nikon MF/AF Bodies \u2013 Lens Compatibility\" http://www.nikonlinks.com/unklbil/bodylens.htm retrieved 3 January 2006\n* Anonymous. \"Modern Photography's Annual Guide to 47 Top Cameras: Nikon F2 Photomic\" p 117.

It was manufactured by the Japanese [[optics]] company Nippon Kogaku K. K. ([[Nikon Corporation]] since 1988) in Japan from September 1971 to 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217025948/http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f2.htm |archive-date=17 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It used a horizontal-travel [[focal plane shutter]] with titanium shutter curtains and a speed range of 1 to 1/2000 second (up to 10 seconds using the self-timer) plus Bulb and Time, and flash X-sync of 1/80 second. It had dimensions (with DE-1 head, see below) of 98&nbsp;mm height, 152.5&nbsp;mm width, 65&nbsp;mm depth and 730 g weight. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.\n\nThe F2 is the second member of the long line of Nikon F-series professional-level 35&nbsp;mm SLRs that began with the [[Nikon F]] (manufactured 1959\u20131974) and followed each other in a sort of dynastic succession as the top-of-the-line Nikon camera. The other members were the [[Nikon F3|F3]] (1980\u20132001), [[Nikon F4|F4]] (1988\u20131996), [[Nikon F5|F5]] (1996\u20132005) and [[Nikon F6|F6]] (2004\u2013present). The F-series do not share any major components except for the all-important bayonet lens mount ('F mount').\n\nAll Nikon professional F-series SLRs are full [[system camera]]s. This means that each camera body serves as only a modular hub.\n<gallery>\nFile:Nikon F2 body front.jpg|F2S\nFile:Nikon F2 body back open.jpg|F2S, open film door\nFile:F2-titan-11.jpg|F2 \u2013 bayonet F-mount\nFile:Nikon F2 SB SLR camera with GN Auto Nikkor 2,8 f=45mm lens.JPG|Nikon F2SB with DP-3 prism and GN Auto Nikkor 1:2,8 f=45mm lens\nFile:F2-titan-5.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\nFile:F2-titan-7.jpg|F2A \u2013 titanium body with DP-11 prism\n</gallery>\n\n==Features==\nThe Nikon F2 is an all-metal, mechanically-controlled (springs, gears, levers), manual focus SLR with manual exposure control. The camera itself needed no batteries, though the prism [[light meter]] did (and of course the motor drive if added). The F2 replaced the Nikon F, adding many new features (a faster 1/2000-second maximum shutter speed, a swing open back for easier film loading, a wider assortment of detachable finders and metering heads, a 250 exposure film back, a larger reflex mirror to ensure no vignetting, and a shutter release nearer the front of the camera for better ergonomics). It also offered a detachable motor drive, something the F only had as a custom modification. It was the last all-mechanical professional-level Nikon SLR.\n\n==Lenses==\nThe F2 accepts all lenses with the [[Nikon F-mount|Nikon F bayonet mount]] (introduced in 1959 on the Nikon F camera), with certain limitations or exceptions depending on the F2 version. The later F2A and F2AS Photomic variants (see below) require lenses supporting the Automatic maximum aperture Indexing (AI) feature (introduced in 1977). The manual focus Nippon Kogaku made AI lenses were the Nikkor AI-S, Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E types. The AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. The original Nikkor \"non-AI\" (introduced before 1977) lenses, will mount but require stop down metering. Nippon Kogaku had a service to retrofit non-AI lenses with a new aperture ring with the AI feature to produce \"AI'd\" lenses, but this service ended decades ago.\n\nThe older F2, F2S and F2SB Photomic variants (see below) require lenses with a \"meter coupling shoe\" (or prong, informally called \"rabbit ears\" by photography enthusiasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cameragx.com/2009/09/17/a-history-of-slr-cameras-in-50-years-of-bayonet-evolution-part-ii-of-vi/|title=50 years of lens mount evolution (Part II of VI)|date=17 September 2009}}</ref> These lenses are the Nikkor non-AI, AI'd Nikkor, Nikkor AI and Nikkor AI-S types. Lenses without rabbit ears, such as the Nikon Series E, AF Nikkor, AF Nikkor D, AF-I Nikkor and AF-S Nikkor types, will mount but require stop down metering.\n\nThe F2 with plain/eye-level DE-1 prism (no light meter; see below) will work with either lens types. Note that the Nikkor AI-S and Nikkor AI types are AI types plus have rabbit ears and will function properly on all Nikon F2 variants.\n\nNikon's most recent 35mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (2000) lacking an aperture control ring; and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's DX digital SLRs, will mount but will not function properly. A few exotic fisheye lenses from the 1960s require mirror lock-up and therefore an auxiliary viewfinder is preferred. IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's [[Advanced Photo System]] (APS) film SLRs, must not be mounted on any F2, as their rear elements will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage even with the mirror locked up.\n\nIn 1977 Nippon Kogaku made about 55 non-AI and AI lenses, ranging from a '''Fisheye-Nikkor 6&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' 220\u00b0 circular fisheye to a '''Reflex-Nikkor 2000&nbsp;mm f/11''' super-long mirror telephoto. This was the largest lens selection in the world by far.\n\nThe standard lens for most professionals was the '''Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4''', but some preferred the '''Nikkor 35&nbsp;mm f/2''' with a wider field of view for grab shots. The '''Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/2.5''' was renowned for its superb sharpness and [[bokeh]] and was a favorite for head-and-shoulders portraits (\"head shots\").\n\nSpecial purpose lenses included the '''Micro-Nikkors 55&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' and '''55&nbsp;mm f/2.8''', '''Micro-Nikkor 105&nbsp;mm f/4''' for close-up \"macro\" photography, the '''Noct-Nikkor 58&nbsp;mm f/1.2''' for low light photography, the '''PC-Nikkor 28&nbsp;mm f/3.5''' shifting perspective control lens, the '''GN-Nikkor 45&nbsp;mm f/2.8''' for automatically setting the proper aperture for flash exposure based on distance (also useful as a very small/light \"pancake\" lens), the '''[[Nikkor 13mm f/5.6]]''' widest angle (118\u00b0) rectilinear lens for SLRs ever made, the '''Nikkor 300&nbsp;mm f/2.8 ED IF''' fast telephoto useful for sports and wildlife photography, the versatile, but heavy '''Zoom-Nikkor 50\u2013300&nbsp;mm f/4.5 ED''' and the quick framing, but notoriously middling optical-quality '''Zoom-Nikkor 43\u201386&nbsp;mm f/3.5'''.\n\nThere were innumerable independent manufacturer lenses available in the Nikon F mount. The most famous was probably the [[Vivitar]] Series 1 70\u2013210&nbsp;mm f/3.5 Macro Zoom (released 1974), the first independent zoom lens to meet most professional photographers' quality standards.\n\n==Viewfinders==\nHowever, it was the F2's interchangeable viewfinders (also known as \"heads\")<ref>[http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/d-archives/history-f2/index.htm Nikon Article on F2's Debut], Nikon</ref> that marked it as a truly professional-level SLR and was its greatest strength. By providing updated heads every few years, Nippon Kogaku was able to introduce new versions of the F2 and keep the basic body in the latest technology until production ended in 1980. Note that F2 heads were often sold separately from the body, mostly in black finish with about 10% in chrome, and it is therefore not unusual to see body/head combinations with mismatched serial numbers and/or colors.\n\nThe head on the basic Nikon F2 was called the '''Nikon DE-1'''. It provided a virtually 100% accurate viewing image, but was a plain pentaprism eyelevel viewing head with no built-in light meter and so had no metering or exposure information display, except for a flash-ready light. Unlike the other heads, about 90% of DE-1s were chrome finished. It was unpopular because of the lack of a built-in meter, but remained available for the life of the F2. F2 bodies with DE-1 finders maintain the highest prices on the secondary market.\n\nIf a pentaprism head with a built-in light meter was mounted on the F2, the camera became an F2 Photomic. However, since Nippon Kokagu made five different metering heads over the life of the F2, there were five different F2 Photomic versions. The use of any Photomic head requires that batteries (two S76 or A76, or SR44 or LR44) be installed in the F2 body to power the head's electronics.\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 and DP-2.jpg|thumb|Nikon DP-1 and DP-2 viewfinders]]\nThe original '''Nikon F2 Photomic''', packaged with the '''Nikon DP-1''' head, was manufactured from 1971 to 1977. The DP-1 had a center-the-needle exposure control system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving between horizontally arranged +/\u2013 over/underexposure markers at the bottom of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the photographer's actual camera selections. Flanking the needle array on the left and right were a readout of the camera set f-stop and shutter speed, respectively. The needle array was duplicated on the top of the DP-1 head to allow exposure control without looking through the viewfinder. A Nikon F2 Photomic with Nikkor-S 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $660 in 1972. Note that SLRs usually sold for 30 to 40 percent below list price.\n[[File:Nikon DP-1 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|Needle lightmeter on DP-1]]\n\n[[File:Nikon DP-2 lightmeter.jpg|thumb|LED lightmeter on DP-2]]\n[[Image:F2s.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Nikon F2s using the DP-2 viewfinder]]\nManufactured from 1973 to 1977, the '''F2S Photomic''' used the '''DP-2''' head. Although it looked very different, the DP-2 was functionally very similar to the DP-1. It substituted an all-solid-state light-both-LEDs exposure control system using two arrow-shaped [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) over/underexposure indicators for better visibility in low light situations and better overall reliability. This was important, because the DP-2's CdS meter had better low-light sensitivity than the DP-1\u2014down to Exposure Value (EV) \u22122, instead of EV 1, at ASA 100. A chrome Nikon F2S Photomic with Nikkor 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $961 in 1976. Note: SLRs were usually discounted 30 to 40 percent from list.\n\nWith the '''DP-3''' head, the camera became the '''F2SB Photomic''', available 1976 to 1977. The DP-3 introduced three innovations: a silicon photodiode light meter (a first for Nikon SLRs) for faster and more accurate light readings, a five-stage center-the-LED exposure control system using +/o/\u2212 LEDs, and an eyepiece blind.\n\nThese three early Photomic heads required Nikon F-mount lenses with a meter coupling shoe (\"rabbit ears\", see above). Rabbit ear lenses required a special mounting procedure. After mounting, the lens aperture ring must be turned back and forth to the smallest aperture (largest f-stop number) and then to the largest aperture (smallest f-stop number) to ensure that the lens and the head couple properly (Nippon Kogaku called it indexing the maximum aperture of the lens\u2014users called it the Nikon Shuffle!) and meter correctly. This system seems unwieldy to today's photographers, but it was second nature to Nikon and [[Nikkormat]] camera using photographers of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Image:Nikon-F2AS.jpg|thumb|A black body F2AS (incl DP-12 prism, as seen here) was very popular among photojournalists in the 1970s.]]\n[[Image:F2AScloseup.jpg|thumb|250|An F2AS (incl DP-12 prism). The EV metering range is a remarkable -2 to 17 with 100 ASA film.]]\nThe '''F2A Photomic''' came with the '''DP-11''' head; the '''F2AS Photomic''' used the '''DP-12''' head. The DP-11 and DP-12 (both introduced in 1977) functioned exactly the same as the DP-1 and DP-3, respectively, except that these heads supported Nikkor lenses with the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (introduced 1977, see above). Nikkor AI lenses had a \"meter coupling ridge\" cam on the lens aperture ring that pushed on a spring-loaded \"meter coupling lever\" on the Photomic head to transfer aperture setting information. AI lenses allowed carefree lens mounting and ended the double twisting that used to allow observers to spot a Nikon/Nikkormat user from a hundred paces. The F2AS Photomic (DP-12 head) was the most advanced F2 version and the chrome version with Nikkor AI 50&nbsp;mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $1,278 in 1978. (SLR selling prices were typically 30 to 40 percent below list.) This, the last version of the Nikon F2 Photomic, has become the most desired and collected F2 today.\n\nThe F2S Photomic (DP-2 head) and F2SB Photomic (DP-3 head) also accepted the unusual '''Nikon DS-1''' or '''DS-2 EE Aperture Control Units'''. The F2AS (DP-12) required the equivalent '''DS-12'''. These were early attempts by Nippon Kogaku to provide shutter priority autoexposure by having an electric servomotor automatically turn the lens aperture ring in response to the set shutter speed and light meter reading. The DS-1, -2 and -12 were bulky, slow and unreliable, and were feeble and inelegant attempts to add autoexposure to the manual exposure F2.\n\nThere were also three special purpose meterless heads available for the F2: the '''Nikon DW-1''' waist-level finder (a non-pentaprism head; look down directly at the mirror-reversed image on the focusing screen), the '''DA-1''' action finder (providing 60&nbsp;mm of eye relief; extremely large exit pupil that can be viewed while wearing face masks, safety goggles, etc.) and the '''DW-2''' 6X magnifying finder (waist-level finder with magnifier; good for precise focusing).\n\n==Focusing screens==\nThe F2 also had interchangeable viewfinder focusing screens. Nippon Kogaku's standard '''Type K''' screen had central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder and 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12&nbsp;mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.\n\nThe optional screens were:\n*'''Type A''' \u2013 central 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Standard equipment with early F2s. Changeover to Type K occurred circa 1976.\n*'''Type B''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm focusing spot plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle. Useful for close ups and long telephotos.\n*'''Type C''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm clear spot with crosshair reticle. Very bright and useful for photo-microscopy, astrophotography, and parallax focusing method.\n*'''Type D''' \u2013 plain matte screen. Best screen for use with long telephotos with small apertures.\n*'''Type E''' \u2013 Type B with a grid of 5 horizontal and 3 vertical lines. Called \"architectural screen\" and excellent for \"Rule of Thirds\" pictorialist compositions. The most popular replacement screen.\n*'''Type G''' \u2013 central 12&nbsp;mm extra-bright microprism without matte background (cannot assess depth of field). Four versions (G1\u2013G4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type H''' \u2013 fullscreen extra-bright microprism; also cannot assess depth of field. Four versions (H1\u2013H4) for use with specific focal length lenses. Intended for sports photography, but not popular because switching lenses might necessitate switching the screen too.\n*'''Type J''' \u2013 central 4&nbsp;mm microprism plus 12&nbsp;mm etched circle.\n*'''Type L''' \u2013 Type A, but with rangefinder set at a 45\u00b0 angle from lower left to upper right. Permits focusing on horizontal or vertical subjects.\n*'''Type M''' \u2013 central 5&nbsp;mm double cross hairs with marked horizontal and vertical scales. Excellent for photo-microscopy.\n*'''Type P''' \u2013 Type L, but adds 1&nbsp;mm microprism collar and fullscreen crosshair. Originally marketed as the \"Apollo P screen,\" it was a screen favored by NASA on the bodies they acquired for their use.\n*'''Type R''' \u2013 Type E, but adds a 3&nbsp;mm split image rangefinder to the center of the screen.\n*'''Type S''' \u2013 for F2 Data (see below) only. Type A with etched marking for data imprint area.\n*'''Type T''' \u2013 for F2 Type A with etched markings for taking pictures of TV screens.\nThe combination and wide selection of heads and screens allowed photographers to customize their F2s to their heart's content.\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive.jpg|thumb|Nikon MD-2 motor drive back without camera]]\n[[File:Nikon MD-2 motor drive front.jpg|thumb|MD-2 motor drive front with camera]]\nMajor accessories for the F2 included the '''Nikon MD-1''' (introduced in 1971) and '''MD-2''' (1973) [[motor drive]]s, providing automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second, 6 if the mirror was locked up, plus power rewind. They both required a '''Nikon MB-1''' battery pack holding 10 AA or LR6 batteries in two '''Nikon MS-1''' battery clips. Note that the 5 frame/s rate required that the F2 have its mirror locked up and the MD-1 or -2 be loaded with two '''Nikon MN-1''' nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. (These batteries are long since dead.) With the mirror operating, the maximum advance rate is 4.3 frame/s; with AAs, the rate is 4 frame/s. The addition of the MD-1 or MD-2 greatly increased the overall weight of the camera. With a fully loaded MD-2/MB-1 and 50mm lens, the F2 would weigh in at just over six pounds.\n\nThe F2 also accepted the lighter, cheaper and less capable '''Nikon MD-3''' motor drive. The MD-3 did not have power rewind and had an advance rate of 2.5 frame/s with the standard '''MB-2''' battery pack holding 8 AA or LR6 batteries. Optionally, it could reach 3.5 frame/s with an MB-1 battery pack with 10 AA or LR6 batteries; 4 frame/s with MB-1 and MN-1 nicad battery.\n\nThe F2 could also mount the '''Nikon MF-1''' (33/10 feet/meters film = 250 frames; required two '''Nikon MZ-1''' film cassettes) and '''MF-2''' (100/30 feet/meters film = 750 frames; required two '''MZ-2''' film cassettes) bulk film backs. These were very useful if a photographer had a motor drive mounted and needed to take more than seven seconds' worth of photographs. Note that the MF-2 and its MZ-2 cassettes are very rare.\n\nStarting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku introduced the '''Nikon Speedlight SB-2''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-5''' (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), '''SB-6''' (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and '''SB-7E''' (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) [[electronic flash]]es. Note that the F2 did not use a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can be connected to the Nikon shoe via the '''Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler'''.\n\nThe '''Nikon ML-1 Modulite''' was a wireless infrared remote controller with a 200/60 feet/meters line-of-sight range. It was a two part device: a handheld transmitter plus a camera mounted receiver. Note that the receiver needed to be connected to a motor drive. The '''Nikon MW-1''' was a similar device, but was larger and more powerful and used radio signals for a longer 2300/700 feet/meters obstructed view range. The MW-1 could also control three separate F2s by broadcasting three different codes.\n\nThe '''Nikon MT-1''' intervalometer allowed completely untended time lapse photography. It could fire the F2 for a specific number of frames at a particular shutter speed at set time intervals.\n\nNippon Kogaku also made scores of minor accessories for the F2, such as straps, cases, bags, remote firing cords, eyecups, eyepiece correction lenses, supplementary close-up lenses, lens hoods, filters and cases. In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced in excess of US$110,000\u2014the most extensive and expensive in the world.\n\n==Special F2 Versions==\nThere were several special purpose versions of the F2 manufactured in small numbers. Although they were all working cameras, today they are all rare collector's items.\n\n[[File:F2 titan noname.jpg|thumb|150px|F2 T]]\nThe '''F2T''' was a special ultra-rugged version of the F2 (DE-1 head) with [[titanium]] bayonet mount, top and bottom plates, and camera back, plus a special '''DE-1T''' titanium covered meterless prism head, sold in parallel with the regular F2s from 1978 to 1980. Most F2Ts were given a special textured black finish but a very few came in natural titanium finish, including the first F2Ts and the very last F2s ever manufactured. Their serial numbers began with '92', e.g., \"F2 9201544.'\n\nThe '''F2 Titan''' was a black only late variant of the F2T, distinguished by the word \"Titan\" engraved in Roman script on the front of the camera below the shutter release. They carry the number 79 in front of the serial number.\n\nThe H in the '''F2H''' of 1978 denoted \"High Speed\". It was yet another titanium-armored F2 but this time with a fixed (not reflex), semi-silvered, pellicle mirror, manual lens diaphragm control and a mechanically matched titanium-armored '''Nikon MD-100''' high-speed motor drive. The maximum shutter speed is 1/1000 (vs. 1/2000 for other F2 models). The self-timer and shutter settings 'B' and 'T' were omitted. The depth-of-field preview button was replaced with a 'Full-Aperture Viewing Button'. The Nikon MD-100 motor drive was a modified version of the MD-2 motor drive and was powered by the Nikon MB-100. The MB-100 consists of two MB-1 battery packs (20 AA or LR6 batteries, or four Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, providing 30 volts), weighing a massive 960 g empty and reaching 10 frames-per-second film advance rate. The F2H set included the Nikon MH-100 battery charger. All components (body, motor and batterypack) may be detached from each other. The bodies (7-digit serial number) and motordrives (6-digit serial number) do not have matching serial numbers, contrary to often repeated misinformation. Body serial numbers began with 7850001, e.g. 'F2 7850001'. Approximately 400 units were produced making the F2H extremely rare, the rarest of any 'production model' F2, and valuable.\n\nAs the name implies, the '''F2 Data''' had a primitive data back. It used a tiny internal flash unit to imprint the time, date or sequential number on the film. This data back recorded the time by imprinting a tiny picture of a slightly less tiny [[Seiko]] made analogue clock onto the film. It also had a special insert plate that the photographer could write on and have this note imprinted on the film. There were two versions of the F2 Data: one with the '''MF-10''' camera back for standard 35&nbsp;mm film cartridges and one with the '''MF-11''' 250 frame bulk film back. The F2 Data also came packaged with an MD-2 motor drive and your choice of DE-1, DP-11 or DP-12 head plus a special Type S focusing screen that marked the left-side data imprint area. F2 Data bodies carry the numbers '77' in front of the serial number. Approximately 5,000 units were produced.\n\nFinally there was the '''F2A Anniversary''' model. This was marketed as a collector's item of 4,000 specially numbered bodies intended to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Nikon cameras in the USA. A plate was glued to the front of the camera below the shutter release noting, \"25th Anniversary\" (which has fallen off many bodies) and came in a special silver-colored box. The F2A Anniversary was not authorized by Nippon Kogaku; it was the creation of the American importer, Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries (EPOI).\n\n==Current status==\nBecause of the F2's durability, because there were so many manufactured (816,000 units) and because film SLRs have been largely replaced with digital equivalents in many markets, the F2 is still relatively common today and is available on the used market for low prices\u2014US$200\u2013400<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2.html Nikon F2 completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref> depending on the head. However, these may be well worn examples used by professional photographers and are generally in mediocre condition.\n\nThe Nikon F2 is also collectable. If a pristine F2 body and head with date-compatible serial numbers is found, it will carry collector's items price tags. The black body version of the F2AS model, in near new condition, can exceed $1,100 at auction.<ref>[http://collectiblend.com/Cameras/Nikon/Nikon-F2AS.html Nikon F2 AS completed auction prices], CollectiBlend.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*\"Nikon MF/AF Bodies \u2013 Lens Compatibility\" http://www.nikonlinks.com/unklbil/bodylens.htm retrieved 3 January 2006\n* Anonymous. \"Modern Photography's Annual Guide to 47 Top Cameras: Nikon F2 Photomic\" p 117.
