He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, \"It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]]&nbsp;... [and]&nbsp;... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around&nbsp;... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'\"<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.<ref>Priest, 30.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full Moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from \"white traders, planters, or officials\", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''&nbsp;\u2014 the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nFrom then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.<ref>Priest, 30-31.</ref> By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|\"the beast with two backs\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThough there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.\n\n===Basic position===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.\n\nWith the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.<ref name=\"Kar\">{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107\u2013108| isbn = 978-8180614057|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.\n\nThe man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochv\u00edl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333 |journal=Ceskoslovenska Psychiatrie}}</ref> The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63\u201376 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |pmid=11898711 |author1=A.

A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.\n\nA woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.<ref>''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke.

The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.<ref>BabyMed [http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position Viennese Oyster - Sex Position]</ref>\n\n===Butterfly position===\nThe woman can lie on her back with her hips on the edge of a platform such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc.<ref name=\"coville\">Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.</ref> while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.\n\n===Riding high===\n{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}\nIn the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===\n<!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, \"Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.\"  -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wiki-anal missionary.png\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Wiki-tribadism02.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex.

It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact than in any other position; and the couple can hold each other in their arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other's hips with their hands.<ref name=\"BestLove\">{{cite web |author=Cynthia Perkins |url=http://www.smolderingembers.com/missionary-sex-position.html |title=The Missionary Sex Position |publisher=Best Love Making Positions and Techniques |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sextherapyinphiladelphia.com/sexual-positions/ |title=Sexual Positions |publisher=Sex Therapy in Philadelphia |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Aly Walansky |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/59_love_tip.html |title=Sexual Positions Women Enjoy |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the woman needs a high level of trust in the man on top who is in a dominant position vis-a-vis the woman below. The trust is demonstrated by the woman [[Spreadeagle (position)#Sex position|spreading her legs]] in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body.<ref name=\"Colombia\"/> This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation. With the man's weight on the woman, especially on her pelvis, the man has control of the rhythm and depth of his thrusts,<ref name=\"Colombia\">{{cite web |title=The Missionary Position |publisher=Sexual Health Center |url=http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_sexualidad/sexuality/sexual_positions/21_missionary_position.html |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052524/http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_sexualidad/sexuality/sexual_positions/21_missionary_position.html |archivedate=2007-10-20 }}</ref> as well as the duration and intensity of the sexual activity, which may continue after the woman has orgasmed.\n\n===Physical===\nThe missionary position is commonly used the first time a couple has sex. Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: \"The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication.

He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, \"It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]]&nbsp;... [and]&nbsp;... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around&nbsp;... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'\"<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.<ref>Priest, 30.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/> First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full Moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from \"white traders, planters, or officials\", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''&nbsp;\u2014 the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nFrom then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.<ref>Priest, 30-31.</ref> By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).<ref name=\"Priest, 31\"/>\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|\"the beast with two backs\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThough there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.\n\n===Basic position===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.\n\nWith the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.<ref name=\"Kar\">{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107\u2013108| isbn = 978-8180614057|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.\n\nThe man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochv\u00edl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333 |journal=Ceskoslovenska Psychiatrie}}</ref> The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63\u201376 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |pmid=11898711 |author1=A.

A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.\n\nA woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.<ref>''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke.

The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.<ref>BabyMed [http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position Viennese Oyster - Sex Position]</ref>\n\n===Butterfly position===\nThe woman can lie on her back with her hips on the edge of a platform such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc.<ref name=\"coville\">Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.</ref> while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.\n\n===Riding high===\n{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}\nIn the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===\n<!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, \"Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.\"  -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wiki-anal missionary.png\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Wiki-tribadism02.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex.

The trust is demonstrated by the woman [[Spreadeagle (position)#Sex position|spreading her legs]] in an implicit invitation for the man on top to enter the most sexually sensitive part of her body.<ref name=\"Colombia\"/> This, as well as her lack of control, the social expectation of passivity of the woman and the possibility of pregnancy, heightens her feeling of vulnerability. Her lack of control is accentuated because once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation.

Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: \"The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication. Muscles of the pelvic floor are more relaxed if, initially, the missionary position is chosen and a couple of pillows are arranged under the woman's bottom so her hips are tilted upwards.\"<ref name=\"Times\">Stuttaford, Thomas (October 6, 2007).
