Its name is synonymous with the [[Irish Republican|republican]] community in the city, whilst the neighbouring [[Shankill Road]] is predominantly [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]], separated from Falls Road by [[peace lines]]. The road is usually referred to as ''the'' Falls Road, rather than as Falls Road. It is known as the ''Faas Raa'' in [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]].<ref>[http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm Language/Cultural Diversity \u2013 Irish Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107052142/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm |date=7 November 2012 }}, dcalni.gov.uk; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Falls rd, Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|The view from the Falls Road to the city centre, 1981]]\nThe Falls Road derives its name from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[t\u00faath]] na bhF\u00e1l'', an Irish [[petty kingdom]] whose name means \"territory of the enclosures\".<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> This territory was roughly the same as that of the [[ecclesiastical parish]] of the Shankill, which spanned a large portion of modern-day Belfast.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/>\n\nThe Falls Road itself was originally a country lane leading from the city centre but the population of the area expanded rapidly in the 19th century with the construction of several large [[linen]] mills. All of these have now closed or have been repurposed. This original area, which was centred on the junction of modern-day Millfield and College Avenue on what is now Divis Street, was known as Falls and lent its name to the road.<ref>[http://joegraham.rushlightmagazine.com/ Belfast History], rushlightmagazine.com; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> which had previously been called ''The Pound''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Old Pound Loney|url=http://oldbelfastdistricts.rushlightmagazine.com/loney.html|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> The housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. The [[Westlink (road)|Westlink]] linking the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] and [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] motorways now cuts through this area. \n\nThe short stretch of road linking Divis Street to the city centre is known as Castle Street after the original [[Belfast Castle]] which was built nearby by the [[Normans]] in the 12th century. Near the bottom of Castle Street is located Chapel Lane on which [[St Mary's Church, Belfast|St. Mary\u2019s Church]] is situated. This is the oldest [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church in Belfast and dates from 1784. \n\nThe Falls Road forms the first three miles of the A501 which starts in Belfast city centre and runs southwest through the city forking just after the Falls Park into the B102 which continues for a short distance to [[Andersonstown]]. The A501 continues as the Glen Road. The area is composed largely of residential housing, with more public sector housing in the lower sections of the road. There are lots of small shops lining the road as well as schools, churches, hospitals and leisure facilities.  Employment in the area was originally dominated by the large linen mills but these have mostly closed. Today, local employment is in the service sector, health and education with additional employment in other parts of the city. \n\nThe Falls Road district can be roughly divided into three sections.  The Lower Falls which includes Divis Street starts near the city centre and continues to the junction with the [[Grosvenor Road]].  The middle Falls district centres on Beechmount.  The Upper Falls starts about the Donegall Road and continues into [[Andersonstown]].\n\n==Lower Falls==\nThis section of the road stretches from Millfield near the city centre to the Grosvenor Road/[[Springfield Road]] intersection.  The lower part is named Divis Street as formally the Falls Road begins at the junction with Northumberland Street and Albert Street. This area was considered the heart of the Falls Road and was initially composed of rows of small terraced houses which were constructed in the mid to late nineteenth century. The area is detailed in the 1931 Ordnance Survey map of the area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:Falls Road area, Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Falls Road area, Belfast 1981|Children playing near Falls Road, Belfast, 1981]]\nThe housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. Many of the old streets were named after characters and events in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856) which was occurring at that time.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> These include Raglan Street (named after [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], commander of British forces in the [[Crimean War]]), Garnet Street (after [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley]]), Alma Street (after the [[Battle of Alma]]), Balaklava Street (after the [[Battle of Balaklava]]),  Inkerman Street (after the [[Battle of Inkerman]]), Sevastopol Street (after the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol]]), Plevna Street (after the [[Siege of Plevna]]), and Varna Street (after the [[Siege of Varna]]). There were also streets named after Balkan places such as Bosnia Street, Balkan Street, Roumania Street and [[Serbia|Servia]] Street, as well as Milan Street and Omar Street (possibly after common Slavic names). Other streets were named after contemporary political and royal figures such as Peel Street (after [[Robert Peel]]) and Albert Street (named after [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\nThese street names are recalled in the collection of poetry ''The Irish for No'' by [[Ciaran Carson]].  In one of the poems entitled ''The Exiles\u2019 Club'', Carson imagines a group of Belfast exiles:\n:''After years they have reconstructed the whole of the Falls Road, and now''\n:''Are working on the back streets: Lemon, Peel and Omar, Balaclava, Alma.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Ciaran |title=The Irish for No |date=1987 |publisher=Gallery Books |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=1 85235 016 4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/irishforno0000cars }}</ref> \n\nBy the 1960s the buildings in the area had decayed considerably and the [[Belfast Corporation]] introduced a major development plan which involved wholescale demolition of much of the area.  Many of the old street names were retained in the new housing development. In the Divis Street area, the housing was replaced with the Divis Flats complex which consisted of twelve blocks of flats built on top of the historic district formerly known as the [[Pound Loney]].<ref>Megan Deirdre Roy.[http://www.uiowa.edu/~history/Resources/Iowa%20Historical%20Journal%20--%20UG/2007_spring_Megan_Roy.pdf ''Divis Flats: The Social and Political Implications of a Modern Housing Project in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1968\u20131998'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, uiowa.edu; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> The high point of this redevelopment was [[Divis Tower]].  Because of its rapid deterioration, the whole complex, except for Divis Tower, was demolished thirty years later and replaced with blocks of terraced housing.\n\n===Schools===\nAt the foot of Divis Street is located the Millfield campus of [[Belfast Metropolitan College]], the largest further and higher education college in Northern Ireland. Nearby was located the original [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]]. In the [[1960s]], this school transferred to a greenfield site on the [[Glen Road]] in the upper Falls.<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School, Belfast|url=http://www.stmaryscbgs.com//|accessdate= 12 November 2016}}</ref> The original school building is now the home of the [[Edmund Rice Schools Trust]]. Opposite is ''St. Mary's Primary School''.  Nearby is the location of the ''\u00c1rd Scoil'' which was historically the centre for Irish language and culture in the area. Just past it was located the Hastings Street [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] station.\n\nThere are currently two other primary schools in the Lower Falls district.  These are ''St. Peter's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Primary School, Belfast| url=http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| access-date=10 March 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312054730/http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| archive-date=12 March 2017| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> on Ross Road and ''St. Joseph's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Joseph's Primary School, Belfast|url=http://www.stjosephsslatestreet.belfast.ni.sch.uk//|accessdate= 10 March 2017}}</ref> on Slate Street. In addition, there is the Irish language [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]] at the top end of Leeson Street.  Several older schools closed in the late twentieth century due to declining student numbers. These include [[St Finian's Primary School|St Finian's]] and ''St Gall's'' primary schools which were run by the [[De La Salle Brothers|De La Salle Christian Brothers]]. St Comgall's Public Elementary School, in Divis Street, opened in 1932 but closed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Comgall's School |url=https://www.28dayslater.co.uk/threads/st-comgalls-school-divis-belfast.110629/ |website=28 Days Later |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> ''St. Brendan's Primary School'' on nearby Milford Street closed in the 1960s but for two years housed some pupils from [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]] which at that time had exceeded its capacity in its Barrack Street premises. \n\nThe ''Dunlewey Centre''<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunlewey Centre Belfast Belfast|url=http://belfast.cylex-uk.co.uk/company/dunlewey-centre-ltd-15582351.html|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> is located near [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]]. The building was originally the home of the [[Bon Secours Sisters]] and also housed ''St. Vincent\u2019s Primary School for Girls''. It is a now the home of a community education centre.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Start Centre|url=https://newstartedu.org.uk|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref> Dunlewey Street on which it is located is named after the residence of a local mill owner, William Ross, who owned a house in [[Dunlewey]], [[County Donegal]].

This is reflected in the number of Catholic churches in the area. These include [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St Peter's Cathedral]] in the Lower Falls area just off Albert Street. This was originally a parish church built for the expanding Catholic population in the area in the 1860s. It was designed by Fr Jeremiah Ryan McAulay, who had trained as an architect before he became a priest, and built on a site donated by a local baker, [[Bernard Hughes]]. It became the cathedral church for the [[Diocese of Down and Connor|Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor]] and the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Down and Connor in 1986. It is home to St Peter's Schola Cantorum (Choir).<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Cathedral|url=http://www.stpeterscathedralbelfast.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=visit St Peter's Cathedral|url=https://www.inspirock.com/united-kingdom/belfast/st-peters-cathedral-a5141663621|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref> \n\n[[Clonard monastery]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Clonard Monastery|url=http://www.clonard.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> the home of the [[Redemptorist]] religious order, is located nearby. Father [[Alec Reid]] who played an important role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] was based here. \n\nThere were also several Protestant churches in the area. These have either been demolished or converted into other uses as their congregations dwindled with the building of the [[peace lines]].  These churches included the [[Methodist]] church in Divis Street (1850-1966)<ref>{{cite web| title=Falls Road Methodist Church|url=http://methodisthistoryireland.org/product/falls-road-methodist-church-belfast-one-hundred-years-1854-1954//|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> which was designed by [[Charles Lanyon]] and was the original home of the Falls Road [[Orange Order|Orange Lodge]].

These have either been demolished or converted for other purposes.   One of these is Conway Mill, in Conway Street (named after the Conway family, a noted generous family of the Clonard area). Originally a flax spinning mill, it now houses a community enterprise of small businesses, art studios, retail space and education floor.<ref>{{cite web| title=Conway Mill|url=http://www.conwaymill.org/|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> It also houses the [[Irish Republican History Museum]].\n\nOne of three [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]] built in Belfast is situated in the lower Falls Road. It opened on 1 January 1908 and is the last Carnegie library in Belfast still functioning as a library.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catalogue of the Photographic Exhibition of Irish Carnegie Libraries|publisher=An Chomhairle Leabharlanna (Library Council of Ireland)|url=http://www.librarycouncil.ie/documents/AnTaisceCatalogue3.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=4 September 2012</ref> Opposite was located the ''Clonard Picture House'' which closed in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clonard Picture House |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/43751 |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The ''Diamond Picture House'' at the corner of Cupar Street closed in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diamond Picture House |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/43752 |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAt the junction with Grosvenor Road is located [[Dunville Park]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Dunville Park, Belfast|url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/leisure/parks-openspaces/Park-6634.aspx/|accessdate= 12 November 2016}}</ref> which was first opened in 1893.

These included such establishments as McGeowns, the West End Bar, the Laurel Leaf, the Centre Half and Haughey\u2019s. [[Gerry Conlon]], who grew up in Peel Street, recalled in his autobiography ''Proved Innocent'' how he could see several pubs just a few yards from his front door:\n''I\u2019d watch the men off to the pubs. There were three pubs, Paddy Gilmartin\u2019s which was called the Laurel Leaf, Peter Murray\u2019s [the West End Bar] directly opposite, or further down on the right-hand side was Charlie Gormley\u2019s, across from Finnegan\u2019s the butcher shop.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Conlon |first1=Gerry |title=Proved Innocent |date=1990 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London}}</ref> The Centre Half Bar which was located at the corner of Panton Street and the Falls Road was named by the licensee [[Mickey Hamill]] who played for both Belfast Celtic and Glasgow Celtic as well as Manchester United and Manchester City. He captained the Ireland team to their first [[1913\u201314 British Home Championship|Home International]] championship win in 1914.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Law |first1=Gary |title=Historic Pubs of Belfast |date=2008 |publisher=Appletree Press |location=Belfast}}</ref> Most of these bars were demolished as part of the redevelopment of the area which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n[[File:Bobby sands mural in belfast320.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bobby Sands]] mural, Falls Road]]\n[[File:Frederick Douglass mural, Belfast.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Douglass]] mural on the 'Solidarity Wall', subsequently repainted.]]\n\n===Murals===\nOn some walls along the main road have been painted large [[Murals in Northern Ireland|murals]]. These are representations of local and national political issues and figures. One of the most famous is the large mural of [[Bobby Sands]] on the side wall of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s offices at the corner of Sevastopol Street. Further down the road on the corner of Northumberland Street is a series of murals which has come to be called the ''International or Solidarity Wall''. This is a series of images of international figures who have been involved in various liberation struggles. These murals have become a popular attraction for visiting tourists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Murals|\nurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213327/http://www.librarycouncil.ie/documents/AnTaisceCatalogue3.pdf|archive-date=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n\n==Middle Falls==\nThis section of the road centres on the [[Beechmount, Belfast|Beechmount]] district and stretches from the intersection with the Grosvenor Road/Springfield Road to the Whiterock Road.  The district takes its name from Beechmount House which was located at the top of a nearby hill surrounded by beech trees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beechmount|url=http://beechmount.rushlightmagazine.com|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref> It was the former home of [[Eliza and Isabella Riddel]].

It also leads to the [[Black Mountain (Belfast)|Black Mountain]] which forms part of the range of hills overlooking Belfast. Across the Falls Road from the Whiterock Road is the [[Donegall Road]]. This road leads down to the [[Westlink (road)|Westlink]] \u2013 [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] and then on down to [[Shaftesbury Square]] in the city centre. \n\nThrough the area flowed the Clowney Water or River ([[Irish language|Irish]] ''An Chluain'')<ref>{{cite web |title=Logainm.ie |url=https://www.logainm.ie/ga/116182 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> which is a tributary of the larger [[Blackstaff River]].

This was introduced in the late 19th century and replaced by [[trolleybuses]] in 1938.  There were three routes along the road: 11 for Falls Road-Whiterock Road, 12 for Falls Road-Andersonstown Road and 13 for Falls Road-Glen Road. These trolleybuses were replaced by diesel buses in the 1960s. With the outbreak of the troubles, the bus service was withdrawn.  The gap in public transport was replaced by black taxis.  Since the troubles ended, the public bus service has been re-introduced and expanded. [[Metro (Belfast)|Metro]], a division of [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] now operates the bus service. The Falls Road is designated one of the [[Bus rapid transit|quality bus corridors]] (QBCs) within the city with a variety of different routes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Translink |url=https://www.translink.co.uk/getonboard/metroisbelfast |website=Metro is Belfast |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the [[Glider (Belfast)|Glider]] bus service was introduced.

It was the first cross-city bus service.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:James Connolly statue, Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|James Connolly statue, Belfast]]\nA predominantly working-class community, the Falls Road has historically had a strong [[socialist]] tradition, and, prior to the 1970s, had been less [[Irish nationalist]] than other areas of Northern Ireland. [[James Connolly]] resided in the Upper Falls for a period in the early 20th century and was involved in organising the workers<ref>Donal Nevin. ''James Connolly. A Full Life''; (Dublin, 2006, Gill & Macmillan); {{ISBN|0717129624}}</ref> but the area was generally seen as a bedrock of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) at the time. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] standing for [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] lost heavily standing in the [[Belfast Falls (UK Parliament constituency)|Falls]] constituency in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 UK General Election]] to the IPP's [[Joseph Devlin|Joe Devlin]]. Connolly's secretary [[Winifred Carney]] also lived on the Falls with her husband, George McBride, a Protestant and [[World War I]] veteran. She is buried in Milltown Cemetery.\n\nThe past century has seen an ongoing contest between various versions of labour/socialist and nationalist/[[Irish republican]] for electoral leadership in the area. In the 1929 election to the new [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the [[Belfast Falls (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast, Falls]] constituency was won by the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist]] [[Richard Byrne (politician)|Richard Byrne]] after a bitter contest with [[William McMullen (politician)|William McMullen]], a supporter of Connolly.<ref name=\"farrell\">[[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]], ''Northern Ireland: The Orange State''</ref>\n\nIn the 1945 election, [[Harry Diamond (politician)|Harry Diamond]] won the seat standing for the [[Socialist Republican Party (Ireland)|Socialist Republican Party]].

Devlin, who had once been a member, alongside Diamond, of the Belfast branch of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]], became a founding member of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] in 1970 and remained a member until [[Government of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] was prorogued in 1972.<ref name=\"Irish Political Studies\">Connal Parr (2012): Managing His Aspirations: The Labour and Republican Politics of Paddy Devlin, Irish Political Studies, 27:1, 111-138</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Billy McMillen]] stood as a [[Republican Clubs]] candidate for the [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] constituency in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] election. His office was in Divis Street and the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] alongside the [[The Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] of Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army]] was displayed in the window. The [[Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954|Flags and Emblems Act]] gave the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] the power to remove any flag or emblem from public or private property which was considered to be likely to cause a breach of the peace. This was generally interpreted as any Irish flag since the [[Union Jack]] was specifically excluded from the Act.\n\n[[Ian Paisley]] insisted the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] remove the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] or he would organise a march and remove it himself.  The police feared a backlash from Loyalists, and removed it, causing unrest and rioting by local residents.<ref>Peter Taylor.

In 2014, five [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], one [[SDLP]] and one [[People Before Profit]] councillors were elected. The Falls Road forms the centre of the [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)]]. The Westminster seat has been held by various nationalist politicians since the 1960s. [[Paul Maskey]] of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] was elected [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] in 2011, but in line with Sinn F\u00e9in's abstentionist policy he has not actually taken the seat at [[Westminster]].

This was removed in August 2005 as part of the [[British government]]'s normalisation programme, following the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s statement that it was ending its armed activities. In the intervening period, the Falls Road area saw some of the worst violence of \"[[the Troubles]]\".

Its name is synonymous with the [[Irish Republican|republican]] community in the city, whilst the neighbouring [[Shankill Road]] is predominantly [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]], separated from Falls Road by [[peace lines]]. The road is usually referred to as ''the'' Falls Road, rather than as Falls Road. It is known as the ''Faas Raa'' in [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]].<ref>[http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm Language/Cultural Diversity \u2013 Irish Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107052142/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm |date=7 November 2012 }}, dcalni.gov.uk; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Falls rd, Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|The view from the Falls Road to the city centre, 1981]]\nThe Falls Road derives its name from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[t\u00faath]] na bhF\u00e1l'', an Irish [[petty kingdom]] whose name means \"territory of the enclosures\".<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> This territory was roughly the same as that of the [[ecclesiastical parish]] of the Shankill, which spanned a large portion of modern-day Belfast.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/>\n\nThe Falls Road itself was originally a country lane leading from the city centre but the population of the area expanded rapidly in the 19th century with the construction of several large [[linen]] mills. All of these have now closed or have been repurposed. This original area, which was centred on the junction of modern-day Millfield and College Avenue on what is now Divis Street, was known as Falls and lent its name to the road.<ref>[http://joegraham.rushlightmagazine.com/ Belfast History], rushlightmagazine.com; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> which had previously been called ''The Pound''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Old Pound Loney|url=http://oldbelfastdistricts.rushlightmagazine.com/loney.html|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> The housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. The [[Westlink (road)|Westlink]] linking the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] and [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] motorways now cuts through this area. \n\nThe short stretch of road linking Divis Street to the city centre is known as Castle Street after the original [[Belfast Castle]] which was built nearby by the [[Normans]] in the 12th century. Near the bottom of Castle Street is located Chapel Lane on which [[St Mary's Church, Belfast|St. Mary\u2019s Church]] is situated. This is the oldest [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church in Belfast and dates from 1784. \n\nThe Falls Road forms the first three miles of the A501 which starts in Belfast city centre and runs southwest through the city forking just after the Falls Park into the B102 which continues for a short distance to [[Andersonstown]]. The A501 continues as the Glen Road. The area is composed largely of residential housing, with more public sector housing in the lower sections of the road. There are lots of small shops lining the road as well as schools, churches, hospitals and leisure facilities.  Employment in the area was originally dominated by the large linen mills but these have mostly closed. Today, local employment is in the service sector, health and education with additional employment in other parts of the city. \n\nThe Falls Road district can be roughly divided into three sections.  The Lower Falls which includes Divis Street starts near the city centre and continues to the junction with the [[Grosvenor Road]].  The middle Falls district centres on Beechmount.  The Upper Falls starts about the Donegall Road and continues into [[Andersonstown]].\n\n==Lower Falls==\nThis section of the road stretches from Millfield near the city centre to the Grosvenor Road/[[Springfield Road]] intersection.  The lower part is named Divis Street as formally the Falls Road begins at the junction with Northumberland Street and Albert Street. This area was considered the heart of the Falls Road and was initially composed of rows of small terraced houses which were constructed in the mid to late nineteenth century. The area is detailed in the 1931 Ordnance Survey map of the area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:Falls Road area, Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Falls Road area, Belfast 1981|Children playing near Falls Road, Belfast, 1981]]\nThe housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. Many of the old streets were named after characters and events in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856) which was occurring at that time.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> These include Raglan Street (named after [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], commander of British forces in the [[Crimean War]]), Garnet Street (after [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley]]), Alma Street (after the [[Battle of Alma]]), Balaklava Street (after the [[Battle of Balaklava]]),  Inkerman Street (after the [[Battle of Inkerman]]), Sevastopol Street (after the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol]]), Plevna Street (after the [[Siege of Plevna]]), and Varna Street (after the [[Siege of Varna]]). There were also streets named after Balkan places such as Bosnia Street, Balkan Street, Roumania Street and [[Serbia|Servia]] Street, as well as Milan Street and Omar Street (possibly after common Slavic names). Other streets were named after contemporary political and royal figures such as Peel Street (after [[Robert Peel]]) and Albert Street (named after [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\nThese street names are recalled in the collection of poetry ''The Irish for No'' by [[Ciaran Carson]].  In one of the poems entitled ''The Exiles\u2019 Club'', Carson imagines a group of Belfast exiles:\n:''After years they have reconstructed the whole of the Falls Road, and now''\n:''Are working on the back streets: Lemon, Peel and Omar, Balaclava, Alma.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Ciaran |title=The Irish for No |date=1987 |publisher=Gallery Books |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=1 85235 016 4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/irishforno0000cars }}</ref> \n\nBy the 1960s the buildings in the area had decayed considerably and the [[Belfast Corporation]] introduced a major development plan which involved wholescale demolition of much of the area.  Many of the old street names were retained in the new housing development. In the Divis Street area, the housing was replaced with the Divis Flats complex which consisted of twelve blocks of flats built on top of the historic district formerly known as the [[Pound Loney]].<ref>Megan Deirdre Roy.[http://www.uiowa.edu/~history/Resources/Iowa%20Historical%20Journal%20--%20UG/2007_spring_Megan_Roy.pdf ''Divis Flats: The Social and Political Implications of a Modern Housing Project in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1968\u20131998'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, uiowa.edu; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> The high point of this redevelopment was [[Divis Tower]].  Because of its rapid deterioration, the whole complex, except for Divis Tower, was demolished thirty years later and replaced with blocks of terraced housing.\n\n===Schools===\nAt the foot of Divis Street is located the Millfield campus of [[Belfast Metropolitan College]], the largest further and higher education college in Northern Ireland. Nearby was located the original [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]]. In the [[1960s]], this school transferred to a greenfield site on the [[Glen Road]] in the upper Falls.<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School, Belfast|url=http://www.stmaryscbgs.com//|accessdate= 12 November 2016}}</ref> The original school building is now the home of the [[Edmund Rice Schools Trust]]. Opposite is ''St. Mary's Primary School''.  Nearby is the location of the ''\u00c1rd Scoil'' which was historically the centre for Irish language and culture in the area. Just past it was located the Hastings Street [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] station.\n\nThere are currently two other primary schools in the Lower Falls district.  These are ''St. Peter's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Primary School, Belfast| url=http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| access-date=10 March 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312054730/http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| archive-date=12 March 2017| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> on Ross Road and ''St. Joseph's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Joseph's Primary School, Belfast|url=http://www.stjosephsslatestreet.belfast.ni.sch.uk//|accessdate= 10 March 2017}}</ref> on Slate Street. In addition, there is the Irish language [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]] at the top end of Leeson Street.  Several older schools closed in the late twentieth century due to declining student numbers. These include [[St Finian's Primary School|St Finian's]] and ''St Gall's'' primary schools which were run by the [[De La Salle Brothers|De La Salle Christian Brothers]]. St Comgall's Public Elementary School, in Divis Street, opened in 1932 but closed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Comgall's School |url=https://www.28dayslater.co.uk/threads/st-comgalls-school-divis-belfast.110629/ |website=28 Days Later |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> ''St. Brendan's Primary School'' on nearby Milford Street closed in the 1960s but for two years housed some pupils from [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]] which at that time had exceeded its capacity in its Barrack Street premises. \n\nThe ''Dunlewey Centre''<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunlewey Centre Belfast Belfast|url=http://belfast.cylex-uk.co.uk/company/dunlewey-centre-ltd-15582351.html|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> is located near [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]].

This is reflected in the number of Catholic churches in the area. These include [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St Peter's Cathedral]] in the Lower Falls area just off Albert Street. This was originally a parish church built for the expanding Catholic population in the area in the 1860s. It was designed by Fr Jeremiah Ryan McAulay, who had trained as an architect before he became a priest, and built on a site donated by a local baker, [[Bernard Hughes]]. It became the cathedral church for the [[Diocese of Down and Connor|Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor]] and the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Down and Connor in 1986. It is home to St Peter's Schola Cantorum (Choir).<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Cathedral|url=http://www.stpeterscathedralbelfast.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=visit St Peter's Cathedral|url=https://www.inspirock.com/united-kingdom/belfast/st-peters-cathedral-a5141663621|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref> \n\n[[Clonard monastery]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Clonard Monastery|url=http://www.clonard.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> the home of the [[Redemptorist]] religious order, is located nearby. Father [[Alec Reid]] who played an important role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] was based here. \n\nThere were also several Protestant churches in the area. These have either been demolished or converted into other uses as their congregations dwindled with the building of the [[peace lines]].  These churches included the [[Methodist]] church in Divis Street (1850-1966)<ref>{{cite web| title=Falls Road Methodist Church|url=http://methodisthistoryireland.org/product/falls-road-methodist-church-belfast-one-hundred-years-1854-1954//|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> which was designed by [[Charles Lanyon]] and was the original home of the Falls Road [[Orange Order|Orange Lodge]].

These have either been demolished or converted for other purposes.   One of these is Conway Mill, in Conway Street (named after the Conway family, a noted generous family of the Clonard area). Originally a flax spinning mill, it now houses a community enterprise of small businesses, art studios, retail space and education floor.<ref>{{cite web| title=Conway Mill|url=http://www.conwaymill.org/|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> It also houses the [[Irish Republican History Museum]].\n\nOne of three [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]] built in Belfast is situated in the lower Falls Road.

These included such establishments as McGeowns, the West End Bar, the Laurel Leaf, the Centre Half and Haughey\u2019s. [[Gerry Conlon]], who grew up in Peel Street, recalled in his autobiography ''Proved Innocent'' how he could see several pubs just a few yards from his front door:\n''I\u2019d watch the men off to the pubs. There were three pubs, Paddy Gilmartin\u2019s which was called the Laurel Leaf, Peter Murray\u2019s [the West End Bar] directly opposite, or further down on the right-hand side was Charlie Gormley\u2019s, across from Finnegan\u2019s the butcher shop.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Conlon |first1=Gerry |title=Proved Innocent |date=1990 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London}}</ref> The Centre Half Bar which was located at the corner of Panton Street and the Falls Road was named by the licensee [[Mickey Hamill]] who played for both Belfast Celtic and Glasgow Celtic as well as Manchester United and Manchester City. He captained the Ireland team to their first [[1913\u201314 British Home Championship|Home International]] championship win in 1914.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Law |first1=Gary |title=Historic Pubs of Belfast |date=2008 |publisher=Appletree Press |location=Belfast}}</ref> Most of these bars were demolished as part of the redevelopment of the area which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n[[File:Bobby sands mural in belfast320.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bobby Sands]] mural, Falls Road]]\n[[File:Frederick Douglass mural, Belfast.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Douglass]] mural on the 'Solidarity Wall', subsequently repainted.]]\n\n===Murals===\nOn some walls along the main road have been painted large [[Murals in Northern Ireland|murals]]. These are representations of local and national political issues and figures. One of the most famous is the large mural of [[Bobby Sands]] on the side wall of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s offices at the corner of Sevastopol Street. Further down the road on the corner of Northumberland Street is a series of murals which has come to be called the ''International or Solidarity Wall''.

This was introduced in the late 19th century and replaced by [[trolleybuses]] in 1938.  There were three routes along the road: 11 for Falls Road-Whiterock Road, 12 for Falls Road-Andersonstown Road and 13 for Falls Road-Glen Road. These trolleybuses were replaced by diesel buses in the 1960s. With the outbreak of the troubles, the bus service was withdrawn.  The gap in public transport was replaced by black taxis.  Since the troubles ended, the public bus service has been re-introduced and expanded. [[Metro (Belfast)|Metro]], a division of [[Translink]] now operates the bus service. The Falls Road is designated one of the [[Bus rapid transit|quality bus corridors]] (QBCs) within the city with a variety of different routes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Translink |url=https://www.translink.co.uk/getonboard/metroisbelfast |website=Metro is Belfast |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the [[Glider (Belfast)|Glider]] bus service was introduced.

It was the first cross-city bus service.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:James Connolly statue, Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|James Connolly statue, Belfast]]\nA predominantly working-class community, the Falls Road has historically had a strong [[socialist]] tradition, and, prior to the 1970s, had been less [[Irish nationalist]] than other areas of Northern Ireland. [[James Connolly]] resided in the Upper Falls for a period in the early 20th century and was involved in organising the workers<ref>Donal Nevin. ''James Connolly. A Full Life''; (Dublin, 2006, Gill & Macmillan); {{ISBN|0717129624}}</ref> but the area was generally seen as a bedrock of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) at the time. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] standing for [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] lost heavily standing in the [[Belfast Falls (UK Parliament constituency)|Falls]] constituency in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 UK General Election]] to the IPP's [[Joseph Devlin|Joe Devlin]]. Connolly's secretary [[Winifred Carney]] also lived on the Falls with her husband, George McBride, a Protestant and [[World War I]] veteran. She is buried in Milltown Cemetery.\n\nThe past century has seen an ongoing contest between various versions of labour/socialist and nationalist/[[Irish republican]] for electoral leadership in the area. In the 1929 election to the new [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the [[Belfast Falls (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast, Falls]] constituency was won by the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist]] [[Richard Byrne (politician)|Richard Byrne]] after a bitter contest with [[William McMullen (politician)|William McMullen]], a supporter of Connolly.<ref name=\"farrell\">[[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]], ''Northern Ireland: The Orange State''</ref>\n\nIn the 1945 election, [[Harry Diamond (politician)|Harry Diamond]] won the seat standing for the [[Socialist Republican Party (Ireland)|Socialist Republican Party]].

His office was in Divis Street and the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] alongside the [[The Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] of Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army]] was displayed in the window. The [[Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954|Flags and Emblems Act]] gave the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] the power to remove any flag or emblem from public or private property which was considered to be likely to cause a breach of the peace. This was generally interpreted as any Irish flag since the [[Union Jack]] was specifically excluded from the Act.\n\n[[Ian Paisley]] insisted the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] remove the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] or he would organise a march and remove it himself.  The police feared a backlash from Loyalists, and removed it, causing unrest and rioting by local residents.<ref>Peter Taylor.

The Westminster seat has been held by various nationalist politicians since the 1960s. [[Paul Maskey]] of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] was elected [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] in 2011, but in line with Sinn F\u00e9in's abstentionist policy he has not actually taken the seat at [[Westminster]].

This was removed in August 2005 as part of the [[British government]]'s normalisation programme, following the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s statement that it was ending its armed activities.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture.

They may have to perform extensive research into relevant facts. Also, they are drafting legal papers and preparing for an oral argument.\n\nIn England, the usual division of labor is that a [[solicitor]] will obtain the facts of the case from the client and then brief a barrister (usually in writing).<ref>Fiona Boyle, Deveral Capps, Philip Plowden, Clare Sandford, ''A Practical Guide to Lawyering Skills'', 3rd ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing, 2005), 47\u201350.</ref> The barrister then researches and drafts the necessary court pleadings (which will be filed and served by the solicitor) and orally argues the case.<ref>See Abel, ''England and Wales'', 56 and 141.</ref>\n\nIn Spain, the procurator merely signs and presents the papers to the court, but it is the advocate who drafts the papers and argues the case.<ref>Jene, 369.</ref>\n\nIn some countries, like Japan, a [[scrivener]] or clerk may fill out court forms and draft simple papers for lay persons who cannot afford or do not need attorneys, and advise them on how to manage and argue their own cases.<ref name=\"Rokumoto, 164\">Rokumoto, 164.</ref>\n\n===Advocacy (written and oral) in administrative hearings===\nIn most developed countries, the legislature has granted [[original jurisdiction]] over highly technical matters to [[executive branch]] administrative agencies which oversee such things. As a result, some lawyers have become specialists in [[administrative law]]. In a few countries, there is a special category of jurists with a monopoly over this form of advocacy; for example, France formerly had ''conseils juridiques'' (who were merged into the main legal profession in 1991).<ref>Anne Boigeol, \"The French Bar: The Difficulties of Unifying a Divided Profession,\" in ''Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World'', vol. 2, eds.

National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors'', {{ussc|473|305|1985}} (same).</ref>\n\n===Client intake and counseling (with regard to pending litigation)===\nAn important aspect of a lawyer's job is developing and managing relationships with clients (or the client's employees, if the lawyer works in-house for a government or corporation). The client-lawyer relationship is explained in six steps. First, the relationship begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know the client personally. Second step is discovering the facts of the client's case. Thirdly is clarifying what the client wants to accomplish.  The fourth step is where the lawyer shapes the client's expectations as to what actually can be accomplished. The second to last step, begins to develop various claims or defenses for the client. Lastly, the lawyer explains her or his fees to the client.<ref>Paul J. Zwier & Anthony J.

In many countries, only a properly licensed lawyer may provide legal advice to clients for good [[consideration]], even if no [[lawsuit]] is contemplated or is in progress.<ref>Arthurs, 125; Johnsen, 74; and P\u00e9rez-Perdomo, \"Venezuelan Legal Profession,\" 387.</ref><ref>Erhard Blankenburg and Ulrike Schultz, \"German Advocates: A Highly Regulated Profession,\" in ''Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World'', vol. 2, eds.

See Texas Rule 7.02(a)(6).<ref>Texas Bar Rule 7.02(a)(6) - ''[https://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/ForLawyers/MembershipInformation/AdvertisingReview2/TDRPC_VII.pdf   TexasBar.com]''</ref>\n\n===Organizations===\n{{Main|Law firm}}\n\nLawyers in private practice generally work in specialized [[business]]es known as [[law firm]]s,<ref>Anderson, 111\u2013117.</ref> with the exception of English barristers. The vast majority of law firms worldwide are [[small business]]es that range in size from 1 to 10 lawyers.<ref>Hazard, 39.</ref> The United States, with its large number of firms with more than 50 lawyers, is an exception.<ref>Junqueira, 92. According to this source, as of 2003, there were 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers in the United States.</ref> The United Kingdom and Australia are also exceptions, as the UK, Australia and the U.S. are now home to several firms with more than 1,000 lawyers after a wave of mergers in the late 1990s.\n\nNotably, [[barrister]]s in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some states in Australia do ''not'' work in \"law firms\". Those who offer their services to members of the general public\u2014as opposed to those working \"in-house\" \u2014 are required to be self-employed.<ref>Gary Slapper and David Kelly, ''The English Legal System'', 7th ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing Ltd., 2004), 550.</ref> Most work in groupings known as \"sets\" or \"chambers\", where some administrative and marketing costs are shared. An important effect of this different organizational structure is that there is no [[conflict of interest]] where barristers in the same chambers work for opposing sides in a case, and in some specialized chambers this is commonplace.\n\n==Professional associations and regulation==\n[[File:American Bar Association 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the [[American Bar Association]].]]\n\n===Mandatory licensing and membership in professional organizations===\nIn some jurisdictions, either the judiciary<ref>Weisbrot, 264.</ref> or the Ministry of Justice<ref name=\"Johnsen, 86\">Johnsen, 86.</ref> directly supervises the admission, licensing, and regulation of lawyers.\n\nOther jurisdictions, by statute, tradition, or court order, have granted such powers to a professional association which all lawyers must belong to.<ref>Boigeol, \u201cThe French Bar,\u201d 271; Merryman, 106, and Junqueira, 89.</ref> In the U.S., such associations are known as mandatory, integrated, or unified [[bar association]]s. In the Commonwealth of Nations, similar organizations are known as [[Inns of Court]], [[bar council]]s or [[law society|law societies]].<ref>Abel, ''England and Wales'', 127 and 243\u2013249; Arthurs, 135; and Weisbrot, 279.</ref> In civil law countries, comparable organizations are known as Orders of Advocates,<ref>Bastard, 295; and Falc\u00e3o, 401.</ref> Chambers of Advocates,<ref>Blankenburg, 139.</ref> Colleges of Advocates,<ref>Jene, 370.</ref> Faculties of Advocates,<ref>Paterson, 79.</ref> or similar names. Generally, a nonmember caught practicing law may be liable for the crime of [[unauthorized practice of law]].<ref>Arthurs, 143.</ref>\n\nIn common law countries with divided legal professions, barristers traditionally belong to the bar council (or an Inn of Court) and solicitors belong to the law society. In the English-speaking world, the largest mandatory professional association of lawyers is the [[State Bar of California]], with 230,000 members.\n\nSome countries admit and regulate lawyers at the national level, so that a lawyer, once licensed, can argue cases in any court in the land. This is common in small countries like New Zealand, Japan, and Belgium.<ref>Murray, 339; Rokumoto, 163; and Schuyt, 207.</ref> Others, especially those with federal governments, tend to regulate lawyers at the state or provincial level; this is the case in the United States,<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 116.</ref> Canada,<ref>Arthurs, 139.</ref> Australia,<ref>Weisbrot, 244.</ref> and Switzerland,<ref>Bastard, 299.</ref> to name a few. Brazil is the most well-known federal government that regulates lawyers at the national level.<ref>Falc\u00e3o, 404.</ref>\n\nSome countries, like Italy, regulate lawyers at the regional level,<ref>Olgiati, 343.</ref> and a few, like Belgium, even regulate them at the local level (that is, they are licensed and regulated by the local equivalent of bar associations but can advocate in courts nationwide).<ref>Huyse, 239.</ref> In Germany, lawyers are admitted to regional bars and may appear for clients before all courts nationwide with the exception of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'' or BGH); oddly, securing admission to the BGH's bar limits a lawyer's practice solely to the supreme federal courts and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].<ref>Howard D. Fisher, ''The German Legal System and Legal Language'', 3rd ed. (London: Routledge Cavendish, 2002), 208\u2013209.</ref>\n\nGenerally, geographic limitations can be troublesome for a lawyer who discovers that his client's cause requires him to litigate in a court beyond the normal geographic scope of his license. Although most courts have special ''[[pro hac vice]]'' rules for such occasions, the lawyer will still have to deal with a different set of [[professional responsibility]] rules, as well as the possibility of other differences in substantive and procedural law.\n\nSome countries grant licenses to non-resident lawyers, who may then appear regularly on behalf of foreign clients. Others require all lawyers to live in the jurisdiction or to even hold national citizenship as a prerequisite for receiving a license to practice. But the trend in industrialized countries since the 1970s has been to abolish citizenship and residency restrictions. For example, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down a citizenship requirement on equality rights grounds in 1989,<ref>''[[Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia]]'' [1989] 1 SCR 143.</ref> and similarly, American citizenship and residency requirements were struck down as unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1973 and 1985, respectively.<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 68.</ref> The [[European Court of Justice]] made similar decisions in 1974 and 1977 striking down citizenship restrictions in Belgium and France.<ref>Mary C. Daly, \"Ethical and Liability Issues in International Legal Practice,\" in ''Comparative Law Yearbook of International Business'', vol. 17, eds.

That is, lawyers were expected first and foremost to serve the state, and the availability of counsel for private litigants was an afterthought.<ref>Abel, ''Civil Law World'', 10; Johnsen, 70; Olgiati, 339; and Rokumoto, 161.</ref> Even in civil law countries like Norway which have partially self-regulating professions, the Ministry of Justice is the sole issuer of licenses, and makes its own independent re-evaluation of a lawyer's fitness to practice after a lawyer has been expelled from the Advocates' Association.<ref name=\"Johnsen, 86\"/> Brazil is an unusual exception in that its national Order of Advocates has become a fully self-regulating institution (with direct control over licensing) and has successfully resisted government attempts to place it under the control of the Ministry of Labor.<ref>Falc\u00e3o, 423.</ref><ref>Maria da Gloria Bonelli, \"Lawyers' Associations and the Brazilian State, 1843\u20131997,\" <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">28 Law & Soc.

However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a \"friend\" for assistance.<ref>Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.</ref> However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.<ref>Bonner, 204.</ref> Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.<ref>Bonner, 206.</ref> They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession\u2014with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance\u2014like their modern counterparts.<ref>Bonner, 208\u2013209.</ref> Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].<ref>Hazard, 18.</ref>\n\n===Ancient Rome===\nA law enacted in 204 BC barred Roman advocates from taking fees, but the law was widely ignored.<ref>[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.</ref> The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly\u2014but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].<ref>Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.</ref> This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complained that there was no money in working as an advocate.<ref>Crook, 91.</ref>\n\nLike their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.<ref>Crook, 87.</ref> But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').<ref name=\"Crook, 88\">Crook, 88.</ref> Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby; they did not make their primary living from it.<ref name=\"Crook, 88\" /> They gave legal opinions (''responsa'') on legal issues to all comers (a practice known as ''publice respondere'').<ref>Crook, 89.</ref> Roman judges and governors would routinely consult with an advisory panel of jurisconsults before rendering a decision, and advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.<ref name=\"Crook, 88\" /> Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so \"precise, detailed, and technical.\"<ref name=\"Crook, 88\" />\n\n[[File:Sarcofago avvocato Valerius Petrnianus-optimized.jpg|thumb|Detail from the sarcophagus of Roman lawyer [[Valerius Petronianus]] 315\u2013320 AD.

In 1231, two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the [[papal legate]] in London in 1237.<ref>Brundage, 188.</ref> During the same decade, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the king of the [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Kingdom of Sicily]], imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.<ref>Brundage, 188\u2013189.</ref> By 1250, the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.<ref>Brundage, 190.</ref> The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.<ref name=\"Brundage, 189\">Brundage, 189.</ref> Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Brundage, 189\"/> The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of [[Deception|deceit]],<ref>[[Statute of Westminster 1275]], ch. 29.</ref> and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.<ref>John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed.

As a result, the meaning of the term \"lawyer\" may vary from place to place. Some jurisdictions have two types of lawyers, [[barrister]] and [[Solicitor|solicitors]], whilst others fuse the two. A barrister is a lawyer who specializes in higher court appearances. A solicitor is a lawyer who is trained to prepare cases and give advice on legal subjects and can represent people in lower courts. Both barristers and solicitors have gone through law school, completed the requisite practical training. However, in jurisdictions where there is a split-profession, only barristers are admitted as members of their respective bar association.\n\n* In [[Australia]], the word \"lawyer\" can be used to refer to both [[barrister]]s and [[solicitor]]s (whether in private practice or practicing as corporate in-house counsel), and whoever is admitted as a lawyer of the Supreme Court of a state or territory.\n* In Canada, the word \"lawyer\" only refers to individuals who have been [[called to the bar]] or, in [[Quebec]], have qualified as civil law notaries. Common [[law]] lawyers in Canada are formally and properly called \"barristers and solicitors\", but should not be referred to as \"attorneys\", since that term has a different meaning in Canadian usage, being a person appointed under a [[power of attorney]]. However, in Quebec, civil law advocates (or ''avocats'' in [[French language|French]]) often call themselves \"attorney\" and sometimes \"barrister and solicitor\" in English, and all lawyers in Quebec, or lawyers in the rest of Canada when practicing in French, are addressed with the [[honorific]] title, \"Me.\" or \"[[Ma\u00eetre]]\".\n* In [[England]] and Wales, \"lawyer\" is used to refer to persons who provide reserved  and unreserved legal activities and includes practitioners such as [[barrister]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s, [[solicitor]]s, registered foreign lawyers, patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys, licensed conveyancers, public notaries, commissioners for oaths, immigration advisers and claims management services. The  [[Legal Services Act 2007]] defines the ''\"legal activities\"'' that may only be performed by a person who is entitled to do so pursuant to the Act. 'Lawyer' is not a protected title.\n* In Pakistan, the term \"Advocate\" is used instead of lawyer in '''The Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.'''\n*In [[India]], the term \"lawyer\" is often commonly used, but the official term is \"[[Advocate#Advocates in India|advocate]]\" as prescribed under the Advocates Act, 1961.<ref>[http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }}, s. 2.</ref>\n* In Scotland, the word \"lawyer\" refers to a more specific group of legally trained people. It specifically includes [[Advocate#Advocates in Scotland|advocates]] and [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitors]].

They may have to perform extensive research into relevant facts. Also, they are drafting legal papers and preparing for an oral argument.\n\nIn England, the usual division of labor is that a [[solicitor]] will obtain the facts of the case from the client and then brief a barrister (usually in writing).<ref>Fiona Boyle, Deveral Capps, Philip Plowden, Clare Sandford, ''A Practical Guide to Lawyering Skills'', 3rd ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing, 2005), 47\u201350.</ref> The barrister then researches and drafts the necessary court pleadings (which will be filed and served by the solicitor) and orally argues the case.<ref>See Abel, ''England and Wales'', 56 and 141.</ref>\n\nIn Spain, the procurator merely signs and presents the papers to the court, but it is the advocate who drafts the papers and argues the case.<ref>Jene, 369.</ref>\n\nIn some countries, like Japan, a [[scrivener]] or clerk may fill out court forms and draft simple papers for lay persons who cannot afford or do not need attorneys, and advise them on how to manage and argue their own cases.<ref name=\"Rokumoto, 164\">Rokumoto, 164.</ref>\n\n===Advocacy (written and oral) in administrative hearings===\nIn most developed countries, the legislature has granted [[original jurisdiction]] over highly technical matters to [[executive branch]] administrative agencies which oversee such things. As a result, some lawyers have become specialists in [[administrative law]]. In a few countries, there is a special category of jurists with a monopoly over this form of advocacy; for example, France formerly had ''conseils juridiques'' (who were merged into the main legal profession in 1991).<ref>Anne Boigeol, \"The French Bar: The Difficulties of Unifying a Divided Profession,\" in ''Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World'', vol. 2, eds.

National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors'', {{ussc|473|305|1985}} (same).</ref>\n\n===Client intake and counseling (with regard to pending litigation)===\nAn important aspect of a lawyer's job is developing and managing relationships with clients (or the client's employees, if the lawyer works in-house for a government or corporation). The client-lawyer relationship is explained in six steps. First, the relationship begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know the client personally. Second step is discovering the facts of the client's case. Thirdly is clarifying what the client wants to accomplish.  The fourth step is where the lawyer shapes the client's expectations as to what actually can be accomplished. The second to last step, begins to develop various claims or defenses for the client. Lastly, the lawyer explains her or his fees to the client.<ref>Paul J. Zwier & Anthony J.

In many countries, only a properly licensed lawyer may provide legal advice to clients for good [[consideration]], even if no [[lawsuit]] is contemplated or is in progress.<ref>Arthurs, 125; Johnsen, 74; and P\u00e9rez-Perdomo, \"Venezuelan Legal Profession,\" 387.</ref><ref>Erhard Blankenburg and Ulrike Schultz, \"German Advocates: A Highly Regulated Profession,\" in ''Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World'', vol. 2, eds.

See Texas Rule 7.02(a)(6).<ref>Texas Bar Rule 7.02(a)(6) - ''[https://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/ForLawyers/MembershipInformation/AdvertisingReview2/TDRPC_VII.pdf   TexasBar.com]''</ref>\n\n===Organizations===\n{{Main|Law firm}}\n\nLawyers in private practice generally work in specialized [[business]]es known as [[law firm]]s,<ref>Anderson, 111\u2013117.</ref> with the exception of English barristers. The vast majority of law firms worldwide are [[small business]]es that range in size from 1 to 10 lawyers.<ref>Hazard, 39.</ref> The United States, with its large number of firms with more than 50 lawyers, is an exception.<ref>Junqueira, 92. According to this source, as of 2003, there were 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers in the United States.</ref> The United Kingdom and Australia are also exceptions, as the UK, Australia and the U.S. are now home to several firms with more than 1,000 lawyers after a wave of mergers in the late 1990s.\n\nNotably, [[barrister]]s in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some states in Australia do ''not'' work in \"law firms\". Those who offer their services to members of the general public\u2014as opposed to those working \"in-house\" \u2014 are required to be self-employed.<ref>Gary Slapper and David Kelly, ''The English Legal System'', 7th ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing Ltd., 2004), 550.</ref> Most work in groupings known as \"sets\" or \"chambers\", where some administrative and marketing costs are shared. An important effect of this different organizational structure is that there is no [[conflict of interest]] where barristers in the same chambers work for opposing sides in a case, and in some specialized chambers this is commonplace.\n\n==Professional associations and regulation==\n[[File:American Bar Association 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the [[American Bar Association]].]]\n\n===Mandatory licensing and membership in professional organizations===\nIn some jurisdictions, either the judiciary<ref>Weisbrot, 264.</ref> or the Ministry of Justice<ref name=\"Johnsen, 86\">Johnsen, 86.</ref> directly supervises the admission, licensing, and regulation of lawyers.\n\nOther jurisdictions, by statute, tradition, or court order, have granted such powers to a professional association which all lawyers must belong to.<ref>Boigeol, \u201cThe French Bar,\u201d 271; Merryman, 106, and Junqueira, 89.</ref> In the U.S., such associations are known as mandatory, integrated, or unified [[bar association]]s. In the Commonwealth of Nations, similar organizations are known as [[Inns of Court]], [[bar council]]s or [[law society|law societies]].<ref>Abel, ''England and Wales'', 127 and 243\u2013249; Arthurs, 135; and Weisbrot, 279.</ref> In civil law countries, comparable organizations are known as Orders of Advocates,<ref>Bastard, 295; and Falc\u00e3o, 401.</ref> Chambers of Advocates,<ref>Blankenburg, 139.</ref> Colleges of Advocates,<ref>Jene, 370.</ref> Faculties of Advocates,<ref>Paterson, 79.</ref> or similar names. Generally, a nonmember caught practicing law may be liable for the crime of [[unauthorized practice of law]].<ref>Arthurs, 143.</ref>\n\nIn common law countries with divided legal professions, barristers traditionally belong to the bar council (or an Inn of Court) and solicitors belong to the law society. In the English-speaking world, the largest mandatory professional association of lawyers is the [[State Bar of California]], with 230,000 members.\n\nSome countries admit and regulate lawyers at the national level, so that a lawyer, once licensed, can argue cases in any court in the land. This is common in small countries like New Zealand, Japan, and Belgium.<ref>Murray, 339; Rokumoto, 163; and Schuyt, 207.</ref> Others, especially those with federal governments, tend to regulate lawyers at the state or provincial level; this is the case in the United States,<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 116.</ref> Canada,<ref>Arthurs, 139.</ref> Australia,<ref>Weisbrot, 244.</ref> and Switzerland,<ref>Bastard, 299.</ref> to name a few. Brazil is the most well-known federal government that regulates lawyers at the national level.<ref>Falc\u00e3o, 404.</ref>\n\nSome countries, like Italy, regulate lawyers at the regional level,<ref>Olgiati, 343.</ref> and a few, like Belgium, even regulate them at the local level (that is, they are licensed and regulated by the local equivalent of bar associations but can advocate in courts nationwide).<ref>Huyse, 239.</ref> In Germany, lawyers are admitted to regional bars and may appear for clients before all courts nationwide with the exception of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'' or BGH); oddly, securing admission to the BGH's bar limits a lawyer's practice solely to the supreme federal courts and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].<ref>Howard D. Fisher, ''The German Legal System and Legal Language'', 3rd ed. (London: Routledge Cavendish, 2002), 208\u2013209.</ref>\n\nGenerally, geographic limitations can be troublesome for a lawyer who discovers that his client's cause requires him to litigate in a court beyond the normal geographic scope of his license. Although most courts have special ''[[pro hac vice]]'' rules for such occasions, the lawyer will still have to deal with a different set of [[professional responsibility]] rules, as well as the possibility of other differences in substantive and procedural law.\n\nSome countries grant licenses to non-resident lawyers, who may then appear regularly on behalf of foreign clients. Others require all lawyers to live in the jurisdiction or to even hold national citizenship as a prerequisite for receiving a license to practice. But the trend in industrialized countries since the 1970s has been to abolish citizenship and residency restrictions. For example, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down a citizenship requirement on equality rights grounds in 1989,<ref>''[[Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia]]'' [1989] 1 SCR 143.</ref> and similarly, American citizenship and residency requirements were struck down as unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1973 and 1985, respectively.<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 68.</ref> The [[European Court of Justice]] made similar decisions in 1974 and 1977 striking down citizenship restrictions in Belgium and France.<ref>Mary C. Daly, \"Ethical and Liability Issues in International Legal Practice,\" in ''Comparative Law Yearbook of International Business'', vol. 17, eds.

That is, lawyers were expected first and foremost to serve the state, and the availability of counsel for private litigants was an afterthought.<ref>Abel, ''Civil Law World'', 10; Johnsen, 70; Olgiati, 339; and Rokumoto, 161.</ref> Even in civil law countries like Norway which have partially self-regulating professions, the Ministry of Justice is the sole issuer of licenses, and makes its own independent re-evaluation of a lawyer's fitness to practice after a lawyer has been expelled from the Advocates' Association.<ref name=\"Johnsen, 86\"/> Brazil is an unusual exception in that its national Order of Advocates has become a fully self-regulating institution (with direct control over licensing) and has successfully resisted government attempts to place it under the control of the Ministry of Labor.<ref>Falc\u00e3o, 423.</ref><ref>Maria da Gloria Bonelli, \"Lawyers' Associations and the Brazilian State, 1843\u20131997,\" <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">28 Law & Soc.

However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a \"friend\" for assistance.<ref>Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.</ref> However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.<ref>Bonner, 204.</ref> Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.<ref>Bonner, 206.</ref> They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession\u2014with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance\u2014like their modern counterparts.<ref>Bonner, 208\u2013209.</ref> Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].<ref>Hazard, 18.</ref>\n\n===Ancient Rome===\nA law enacted in 204 BC barred Roman advocates from taking fees, but the law was widely ignored.<ref>[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.</ref> The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly\u2014but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].<ref>Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.</ref> This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complained that there was no money in working as an advocate.<ref>Crook, 91.</ref>\n\nLike their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.<ref>Crook, 87.</ref> But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').<ref name=\"Crook, 88\">Crook, 88.</ref> Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby; they did not make their primary living from it.<ref name=\"Crook, 88\" /> They gave legal opinions (''responsa'') on legal issues to all comers (a practice known as ''publice respondere'').<ref>Crook, 89.</ref> Roman judges and governors would routinely consult with an advisory panel of jurisconsults before rendering a decision, and advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.<ref name=\"Crook, 88\" /> Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so \"precise, detailed, and technical.\"<ref name=\"Crook, 88\" />\n\n[[File:Sarcofago avvocato Valerius Petrnianus-optimized.jpg|thumb|Detail from the sarcophagus of Roman lawyer [[Valerius Petronianus]] 315\u2013320 AD.

As James Brundage has explained: \"[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term 'professional.' \"<ref>James A. Brundage, \"The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century,\" <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">20 Syracuse J. Int'l L. & Com. 185</span> (1994).</ref> However, from [[Decretum Gratiani|1150]] onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in [[canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the [[Catholic Church]] as priests.<ref>Brundage, 185\u2013186.</ref> From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.<ref>Brundage, 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nThe legal profession's return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231, two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the [[papal legate]] in London in 1237.<ref>Brundage, 188.</ref> During the same decade, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the king of the [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Kingdom of Sicily]], imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.<ref>Brundage, 188\u2013189.</ref> By 1250, the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.<ref>Brundage, 190.</ref> The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.<ref name=\"Brundage, 189\">Brundage, 189.</ref> Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Brundage, 189\"/> The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of [[Deception|deceit]],<ref>[[Statute of Westminster 1275]], ch. 29.</ref> and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.<ref>John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1990), 179.</ref>  And in 1345, the French crown promulgated a royal ordinance which set forth 24 rules governing advocates, of which 12 were integrated into the oath to be taken by them.<ref>Lucien Karpik, ''French Lawyers: A Study in Collective Action, 1274 to 1994'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 21.</ref>\n\nThe French medieval oaths were widely influential and of enduring importance; for example, they directly influenced the structure of the advocates' oath adopted by the [[Canton of Geneva]] in 1816.<ref name=\"rice\">Carol Rice Andrews, ''Standards of Conduct for Lawyers: An 800-Year Evolution'', 57 SMU L. Rev. 1385 (2004).</ref>  In turn, the 1816 Geneva oath served as the inspiration for the attorney's oath drafted by [[David Dudley Field]] as Section 511 of the proposed New York Code of Civil Procedure of 1848, which was the first attempt in the United States at a comprehensive statement of a lawyer's professional duties.<ref name=\"rice\" />\n\n==Titles==\n[[File:Juris Doctor diploma.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a diploma from [[Suffolk University Law School]] conferring the Juris Doctor degree.]]\n\nGenerally speaking, the modern practice is for lawyers to avoid use of any [[title]], although formal practice varies across the world.\n\nHistorically lawyers in most European countries were addressed with the title of doctor, and countries outside of Europe have generally followed the practice of the European country which had policy influence through colonization.

In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from levered positions in [[interest rate derivative]]s, and subsequently sued [[Bankers Trust]] for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P&G again made headlines when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved a new product developed by the company, [[Olestra]].

The accusation was based on a particular passage in [[the Bible]], specifically [[book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12:1, which states: \"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; [[Woman of the Apocalypse|a woman]] clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars.\" P&G's logo consisted of a man's face on the moon surrounded by 13 stars. Some claimed that the logo was a mockery of the heavenly symbol alluded to in the aforementioned verse, thus construing the logo to be satanic. Where the flowing beard meets the surrounding circle, three curls were said to be a mirror image of the number ''[[666 (number)|666]]'', or the reflected [[number of the beast]]. At the top and bottom, the hair curls in on itself and was said to be the two horns like those of a ram.

By that point, about 80 employees worked for Procter & Gamble. During the [[American Civil War]], the company won contracts to supply the [[Union Army]] with soap and candles. In addition to the increased profits experienced during the war, the military contracts introduced soldiers from all over the country to Procter & Gamble's products.\n\nIn the 1880s, Procter & Gamble began to market a new product, an inexpensive soap that floated in water.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/protor-gamble-makes-everything-2011-2|title=How Procter & Gamble Became The Maker Of EVERYTHING You Buy For Your House|last=Horowitz|first=Alana|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010185635/https://www.businessinsider.com/protor-gamble-makes-everything-2011-2|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The company called the soap [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory]].<ref name=\":0\" /> William Arnett Procter, William Procter's grandson, began a [[profit-sharing]] program for the company's [[workforce]] in 1887. By giving the workers a stake in the company, he correctly assumed that they would be less likely to go on strike.\n\nThe company began to build factories in other locations in the United States because the demand for products had outgrown the capacity of the Cincinnati facilities. The company's leaders began to diversify its products, as well, and in 1911, began producing [[Crisco]], a [[shortening]] made of [[vegetable oils]] rather than [[animal fat]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> As radio became more popular in the 1920s and 1930s, the company sponsored a number of radio programs.\n\n=== International expansion ===\nThe company moved into other countries, both in terms of manufacturing and product sales, becoming an international corporation with its 1930 acquisition of the [[Thomas Hedley Co.]],<ref name=\":0\" /> based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England. After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], until quite recently, when they moved to The Heights, [[Brooklands]].

In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from levered positions in [[interest rate derivative]]s, and subsequently sued [[Bankers Trust]] for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P&G again made headlines when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved a new product developed by the company, [[Olestra]].

They also produced [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]' first original comedy series, ''[[Down to Earth (US TV series)|Down to Earth]]'', which ran from 1984 to 1987 (110 episodes were produced).

In 1985, they produced a game-show pilot called ''The Buck Stops Here'' with [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft Entertainment Television]] in 1985, hosted by [[Jim Peck]]; it was not picked up. Procter & Gamble Productions originally co-produced ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' with [[Sony Pictures Television]] but withdrew before the series premiere due to early press reviews. They also produced the 1991 TV movie ''A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story'', which was co-produced by [[Alan Landsburg Productions|The Landsburg Company]], and continue to produce the [[People's Choice Awards]]. In 2007, PGP teamed up with the now-defunct [[Cookie Jar Group]] to produce the Flash-animated children's series ''[[Will and Dewitt]]'', which features the character Dewitt, the mascot for the Pampers baby product line's former sub-brand, Kandoo. \n\nIn 2013, PGP rebranded itself as Procter & Gamble Entertainment (PGE) with a new logo and an emphasis on multiple-platform entertainment production.\n\n=== Sponsorships ===\nIn addition to its self-produced items through PGE, Procter & Gamble also supports many Spanish-language novellas through advertising on all networks: [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]], [[Estrella TV]], [[Galavisi\u00f3n]], [[Telemundo]], [[UniM\u00e1s]] & [[Univisi\u00f3n]].

Some claimed that the logo was a mockery of the heavenly symbol alluded to in the aforementioned verse, thus construing the logo to be satanic.

The Mavericks were founded in 1989 in [[Miami]], Florida.  Between 1991 and 2003, the band recorded six studio albums, in addition to charting 14 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Their highest-peaking American single was 1996's \"[[All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down]]\", a collaboration with accordionist [[Flaco Jim\u00e9nez]]. They are best known in the UK for their 1998 single \"[[Dance the Night Away (The Mavericks song)|Dance the Night Away]]\", which spent 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 4. In 1996, The Mavericks won a [[Grammy Award]] for the song \"[[Here Comes the Rain]]\".\n\nThe band split up in 2000, reuniting in 2003\u20132004 before splitting up again.  During the period 2001\u20132011, lead singer [[Raul Malo]] released six solo albums. Bass player Robert Reynolds and keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden co-founded the 'supergroup' SWAG, along with Ken Coomer of [[Wilco]], [[Tom Petersson]] of [[Cheap Trick]], and Doug Powell. \n\nIn 2012, the band announced plans for several reunion festival dates. Shortly after, they were offered a record deal by [[Big Machine Records]]. Their reunion album ''[[In Time (The Mavericks album)|In Time]],'' was released in February 2013.  Since then, the group has recorded and toured regularly. \n\n==Career==\nThe Mavericks began their career within the punk and alternative music scene in Miami, Florida, frequently playing on the same bill as emerging acts including [[Marilyn Manson]]. The band initially consisted of singer [[Raul Malo]], guitarist Ben Peeler, bassist Robert Reynolds; and drummer Paul Deakin. This line-up issued an independent self-titled LP before Peeler was replaced by David Lee Holt.\n\nIn 1991, the band was signed by MCA Nashville, and their first major label release, ''[[From Hell to Paradise]],'' debuted in 1992. Holt subsequently left the band, and The Mavericks recorded their follow-up ''[[What a Crying Shame]]'' as a trio, augmented by session musicians.  Nick Kane (lead guitar) appears as the group's fourth member on the album cover, and is credited as a full member of the band in the liner notes, but joined The Mavericks after the album was recorded and does not play on this record. {{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} \n\n''What A Crying Shame'' produced four top 40 country hits: [[What a Crying Shame (song)|the title track]], \"[[O What a Thrill]]\", \"[[There Goes My Heart (The Mavericks song)|There Goes My Heart]]\" and \"I Should Have Been True\". A fifth single, a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"All That Heaven Will Allow\", peaked at number 49.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nin February 1994, piano player Jerry Dale McFadden joined the band as an auxiliary player and \"fifth Maverick\", though he was not at this point an official full member.

The Mavericks were founded in 1989 in [[Miami]], Florida.  Between 1991 and 2003, the band recorded six studio albums, in addition to charting 14 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Their highest-peaking American single was 1996's \"[[All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down]]\", a collaboration with accordionist [[Flaco Jim\u00e9nez]]. They are best known in the UK for their 1998 single \"[[Dance the Night Away (The Mavericks song)|Dance the Night Away]]\", which spent 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 4. In 1996, The Mavericks won a [[Grammy Award]] for the song \"[[Here Comes the Rain]]\".\n\nThe band split up in 2000, reuniting in 2003-2004 before splitting up again.  During the period 2001-2011, lead singer [[Raul Malo]] released six solo albums. Bass player Robert Reynolds and keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden co-founded the 'supergroup' SWAG, along with Ken Coomer of [[Wilco]], [[Tom Petersson]] of [[Cheap Trick]], and Doug Powell. \n\nIn 2012, the band announced plans for several reunion festival dates. Shortly after, they were offered a record deal by [[Big Machine Records]]. Their reunion album ''[[In Time (The Mavericks album)|In Time]],'' was released in February 2013.  Since then, the group has recorded and toured regularly. \n\n==Career==\nThe Mavericks began their career within the punk and alternative music scene in Miami, Florida, frequently playing on the same bill as emerging acts including [[Marilyn Manson]]. The band initially consisted of singer [[Raul Malo]], guitarist Ben Peeler, bassist Robert Reynolds; and drummer Paul Deakin. This line-up issued an independent self-titled LP before Peeler was replaced by David Lee Holt.\n\nIn 1991, the band was signed by MCA Nashville, and their first major label release, ''[[From Hell to Paradise]],'' debuted in 1992. Holt subsequently left the band, and The Mavericks recorded their follow-up ''[[What a Crying Shame]]'' as a trio, augmented by session musicians.  Nick Kane (lead guitar) appears as the group's fourth member on the album cover, and is credited as a full member of the band in the liner notes, but joined The Mavericks after the album was recorded and does not play on this record. {{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} \n\n''What A Crying Shame'' produced four top 40 country hits: [[What a Crying Shame (song)|the title track]], \"[[O What a Thrill]]\", \"[[There Goes My Heart (The Mavericks song)|There Goes My Heart]]\" and \"I Should Have Been True\". A fifth single, a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"All That Heaven Will Allow\", peaked at number 49.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nin February 1994, piano player Jerry Dale McFadden joined the band as an auxiliary player and \"fifth Maverick\", though he was not at this point an official full member. He would contribute to all live shows and studio recordings from this point forward, beginning with 1995's ''[[Music for All Occasions]]''. This album included the single \"[[Here Comes the Rain]]\", which won the band a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] the following year.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=260\u2013261|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Its follow-up was \"[[All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down]]\", their highest country chart peak at number 13.\n\nDuring 1996 and 1997, the band embarked on the \"Tour for All Occasions\" and released a live album, ''It's Now!
