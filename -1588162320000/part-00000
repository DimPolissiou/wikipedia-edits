Complimentary pamphlet prepared and distributed by the Staats-Zeitung to describe its history and new press capacity.</ref>  The partners included George Zahm, Stepan Molitor, Conrad Braeker, and [[Gustavus Adolphus Neumann|Gustav Adolph Neumann]], with Neumann serving as editor-in-chief (as well as reporter and production foreman).  Neumann subsequently purchased shares of the enterprise until, in the late 1830s, he obtained a majority, after which the society was dissolved and he became sole owner.\nThe first issue was published on December 24, 1834.  The nascent newspaper consisted of four pages and was printed weekly using a Washington hand-press.  Initial circulation was small, limited by the capacity of the press (2000 impressions per day) and by the size of the audience (primarily German immigrants).  At that time there were approximately 10,000 German-born citizens in New York City.\n\nGrowth during the first few years of the paper's existence was also impeded by the [[Panic of 1837|Financial Panic of 1837]], but by 1839 it was sufficiently successful to move to a location on Frankfort Street, a few blocks from [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]. Under Neumann's guidance, improvements to the physical plant were undertaken to support the growth that accompanied its increasing influence.  In 1843, on obtaining a single cylinder hand-operated press that could print 600 sheets per hour, he converted the ''Staats-Zeitung'' to a tri-weekly publication.<ref name=\"Epitome\"/>\n\nThe paper's staff also expanded as it grew.  Notable additions included: Jacob Uhl, who may have been hired as a printer as early as 1836;<ref name=\"History\"/> Jacob's wife [[Anna Ottendorfer|Anna Uhl]], who worked as a compositor, secretary, and business manager;<ref name=\"dab\">{{Cite DAB|title=Ottendorfer, Anna Behr Uhl|author=Edwin H. Zeydel|volume=VII, Part 2|pages=106\u2013107}}</ref> and [[Oswald Ottendorfer]], who appears to have been hired in the counting room in 1850.<ref name=\"History\"/>  All had a role to play in the unfolding story.\n\nIn 1845 Jacob Uhl bought ownership and publishing rights from Neumann who, nonetheless, continued in an editorial capacity until 1853. Working together, Jacob and Anna Uhl increased both advertising patronage and circulation, enabling a shift to daily publication not long after the purchase.<ref name=\"Epitome\"/>  Subsequently, the paper's physical plant was moved to and combined with a printing office owned by Jacob Uhl, and a Sunday edition was added on January 3, 1848.  The enhanced paper quickly outgrew both the press capabilities and the physical space of the printing office, and in 1850 Uhl purchased property specifically to house the ''Staats-Zeitung''.  He installed the most rapid printing presses then available in a new building erected on the property for that purpose.<ref name=\"Epitome\"/>   \n[[File:New Yorker Staats Zeitung Building 1858.jpg|thumb|upright|Staats-Zeitung Building, 1857\u20131873]]\nWhen Jacob Uhl died in 1852, Anna Uhl took over management of the newspaper.  The paper continued to thrive, and by 1857 another expansion was required.  Anna Uhl purchased property on what was then [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Chatham Street]] (also known at that time as \"Newspaper Row\", now Park Row) and had a suitable building erected.

Complimentary pamphlet prepared and distributed by the Staats-Zeitung to describe its history and new press capacity.</ref>  The partners included George Zahm, Stepan Molitor, Conrad Braeker, and [[Gustavus Adolphus Neumann|Gustav Adolph Neumann]], with Neumann serving as editor-in-chief (as well as reporter and production foreman).  Neumann subsequently purchased shares of the enterprise until, in the late 1830s, he obtained a majority, after which the society was dissolved and he became sole owner.\nThe first issue was published on December 24, 1834.  The nascent newspaper consisted of four pages and was printed weekly using a Washington hand-press.  Initial circulation was small, limited by the capacity of the press (2000 impressions per day) and by the size of the audience (primarily German immigrants).  At that time there were approximately 10,000 German-born citizens in New York City.\n\nGrowth during the first few years of the paper's existence was also impeded by the [[Panic of 1837|Financial Panic of 1837]], but by 1839 it was sufficiently successful to move to a location on Frankfort Street, a few blocks from [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]. Under Neumann's guidance, improvements to the physical plant were undertaken to support the growth that accompanied its increasing influence.  In 1843, on obtaining a single cylinder hand-operated press that could print 600 sheets per hour, he converted the ''Staats-Zeitung'' to a tri-weekly publication.<ref name=\"Epitome\"/>\n\nThe paper's staff also expanded as it grew.  Notable additions included: Jacob Uhl, who may have been hired as a printer as early as 1836;<ref name=\"History\"/> Jacob's wife [[Anna Ottendorfer|Anna Uhl]], who worked as a compositor, secretary, and business manager;<ref name=\"dab\">{{Cite DAB|title=Ottendorfer, Anna Behr Uhl|author=Edwin H. Zeydel|volume=VII, Part 2|pages=106\u2013107}}</ref> and [[Oswald Ottendorfer]], who appears to have been hired in the counting room in 1850.<ref name=\"History\"/>  All had a role to play in the unfolding story.\n\nIn 1845 Jacob Uhl bought ownership and publishing rights from Neumann who, nonetheless, continued in an editorial capacity until 1853. Working together, Jacob and Anna Uhl increased both advertising patronage and circulation, enabling a shift to daily publication not long after the purchase.<ref name=\"Epitome\"/>  Subsequently, the paper's physical plant was moved to and combined with a printing office owned by Jacob Uhl, and a Sunday edition was added on January 3, 1848.  The enhanced paper quickly outgrew both the press capabilities and the physical space of the printing office, and in 1850 Uhl purchased property specifically to house the ''Staats-Zeitung''.  He installed the most rapid printing presses then available in a new building erected on the property for that purpose.<ref name=\"Epitome\"/>   \n[[File:New Yorker Staats Zeitung Building 1858.jpg|thumb|upright|Staats-Zeitung Building, 1857\u20131873]]\nWhen Jacob Uhl died in 1852, Anna Uhl took over management of the newspaper.  The paper continued to thrive, and by 1857 another expansion was required.  Anna Uhl purchased property on what was then [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Chatham Street]] (also known at that time as \"Newspaper Row\", now Park Row) and had a suitable building erected.

It was released on September 9, 2015 by [[SM Entertainment]] and distributed by [[KT Music]], marking their second proper release in 2015 following the debut [[extended play]] [[Ice Cream Cake (EP)|''Ice Cream Cake'']] in March 2015. The album focuses solely on the group's \"Red\" image stemming from [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|the group's name and concept]], showing the group's vivid and bold image with mainly [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] incorporation. [[LDN Noise]], [[Ryan S. Jhun]], [[Denzil 'DR' Remedios|Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]], [[Dsign Music]], [[Kenzie (songwriter)|Kenzie]], [[Daniel \"Obi\" Klein, Charlie Taft|Deekay]], [[Charli Taft]], Jinbo, [[Dem Jointz]], as well as others, handled production of the album, with S.M. founder [[Lee Soo-man]] serving as the executive producer of the album. A similar conceptual follow-up to the album called ''[[The Velvet]]'' was later released in the first half of 2016, which was composed of mostly [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] tracks and ballads showcasing the \"Velvet\" half with a more mature and sophisticated side of the girl group.\n\nUpon its release, ''The Red'' received positive reviews from critics for its musical diversity while showing the \"quirkiness\" of Red Velvet. The album was a commercial success, becoming Red Velvet's second chart-topper on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] in South Korea. It also attained international success, becoming the group's first number one title on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' World Album Chart, while peaking at number twenty-four on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums chart]]. It was later included as ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s 10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015.\n\nPromotion for the album was preceded by the release of the lead single \"[[Dumb Dumb]]\" on the same release day, along with live performances on weekly music shows for both \"Dumb Dumb\" and the album track \"Huff 'n' Puff\". The lead single was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] and number three on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' World Digital Songs chart while becoming one of the group's signature \"Red\" singles.\n\n==Background and release==\nFollowing the group's first major release ''Ice Cream Cake'' in March 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that Red Velvet would be returning with their first [[Studio album|full album]] in early September. On September 3, a series of image teasers were revealed on the group's official [[Instagram]] account, along with the album's tracklist. On September 4, the company announced that the full album would be released at midnight on September 9, with \"Dumb Dumb\" serving as the lead single (aka title track).<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Velvet Reveals Track List for Their First Album \"Red\" Through Fun Instagram Surprise |website=Soompi |url=http://www.soompi.com/2015/09/03/red-velvet-reveals-track-list-for-their-first-album-red-through-fun-instagram-surprise/ |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |date=September 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stoo.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?sec=enter99&idxno=2015090410011291722 |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |author=Lee So-dam |website=Sports Today |date=September 4, 2015|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3 9\uc6d49\uc77c \ucef4\ubc31 \ud655\uc815\u2026SM \ud558\ubc18\uae30 \uccab\uc8fc\uc790 [\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20\ud22c\ub370\uc774]|language=Korean}}</ref> A series of video teasers was released since September 4, including song previews for \"Huff 'n' Puff\", \"Don't U Wait No More\", \"Time Slip\", \"Dumb Dumb\" and \"Red Dress\".

The opening track and lead single \"[[Dumb Dumb]]\" is described as \"an [[uptempo]] dance track\" with \"infectious hook\" and \"groovy beat\". Heavily influenced by [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] elements, the song is composed by producer [[Ryan S. Jhun]] and [[British people|British]] [[production team]] [[LDN Noise]], the latter whom have previously written and produced songs for fellow [[S.M. Entertainment]] labelmate [[Shinee|SHINee]] and [[TVXQ]].

It is followed by \"Huff 'n' Puff\", an [[Electropop|electro-pop]] song that features  a [[dubstep]]-like breakdown that sings about waking up from a dream and coming back to reality, like [[Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] falling down the rabbit hole.<ref>{{Cite episode |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |series=Gayo Plaza |author=Kim Chang-ryul |network=[[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] |station=SBS Power FM |location=Seoul |date=September 24, 2015 |language=Korean}}</ref> The third track \"Campfire\" is described as an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] pop song that has an ear-catching rhythmical guitar intro. The fourth track \"Red Dress\" is a dominant dance-pop track with lots of synth element running through the song, clapping-like [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[Marching band|marching]]-influenced [[drumline]] which tells a story in which a girl wears a red dress and clumsily but slyly tempts a man who treats her only as a child. The soulful, R&B-flavored \"Oh Boy\" showcases the singing ability and highlights harmonization of the girlgroup, while being the next three songs which are produced by LDN Noise. Ryan S. Jhun co-produced the former two tracks, with additional production by [[Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]] on \"Campfire\" and Dsign Music on \"Red Dress\". \n\nThe latter half of ''The Red'' starts with the sixth track \"Lady's Room\", an uptempo R&B, [[synth-pop]] song that sings about the sisterhood between girls and the happy moments they share. It was one of three tracks produced by [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]] along with the next track \"Time Slip\", which is a 90s-influenced [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-based R&B song with lyrics that describes the laziness and listlessness that one feels while going back and forth between dream and reality in the morning. \"Time Slip\" also sees the participation of British songwriter Charli Taft, whom had previously co-written and produced \"[[Automatic (Red Velvet song)|Automatic]]\" along with Daniel Klein, while marking the first collaboration from South Korean music producer Jinbo for the girl group. The eighth track \"Don't U Wait No More\" highlights the group's harmonization over a heavy synth production with a harmonized \"Don't you wait no more\" [[Hook (music)|hook]], with the lyrics revolve around a girl trying to get closer to her hesitant boyfriend, followed by the [[bossa nova]]-influenced [[midtempo]] pop-rock track \"Day 1\", which describes the feeling of new love by combining the electric, funky guitar sound and the melodic piano with the vocals of the members. The album ends with \"Cool World\", a [[synth-pop]] uptempo song with hopeful lyrics about embracing and living as themselves. \n\n==Promotion==\nPromoting activities for the album started with a \"[[Comeback (K-pop)|comeback showcase]]\" by Red Velvet where they performed \"Dumb Dumb.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&aid=0000755959&lfrom=twitter|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3 \uc774\ubc88 \ucef4\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uccab \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ub4e4|author=Kim Ye-na|date=September 4, 2015|website=TV Report|language=Korean|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> They also appeared on a 5-episode live broadcast through the [[Naver]] V-Live [[Mobile app|app]] called ''\uc624\ubc29\ub9cc\uc871!

The opening track and lead single \"[[Dumb Dumb]]\" is described as \"an [[uptempo]] dance track\" with \"infectious hook\" and \"groovy beat\". Heavily influenced by [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] elements, the song is composed by producer [[Ryan S. Jhun]] and [[British people|British]] [[production team]] [[LDN Noise]], the latter whom have previously written and produced songs for fellow [[S.M. Entertainment]] labelmate [[Shinee|SHINee]] and [[TVXQ]]. The lyrics describes a girl's awkwardness in front of the person of her affection, comparing herself to that of a mannequin.<ref>{{cite web |title=Red Velvet to Return with Full-Length Album 'The Red' on September 9 |author=Lee Ji Young |website=enewsWorld |url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/97475/red-velvet-to-return-with-full-length-album-the-red-on-september-9 |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |date=September 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907212759/http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/97475/red-velvet-to-return-with-full-length-album-the-red-on-september-9 |archive-date=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The rap section of \"Dumb Dumb\" includes several references to [[Michael Jackson]]'s song discography, such as  \"[[Beat It]]\", \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]\", \"[[Billie Jean]]\" and \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\". It is followed by \"Huff 'n' Puff\", an [[Electropop|electro-pop]] song that features  a [[dubstep]]-like breakdown that sings about waking up from a dream and coming back to reality, like [[Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] falling down the rabbit hole.<ref>{{Cite episode |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |series=Gayo Plaza |author=Kim Chang-ryul |network=[[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] |station=SBS Power FM |location=Seoul |date=September 24, 2015 |language=Korean}}</ref> The third track \"Campfire\" is described as an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] pop song that has an ear-catching rhythmical guitar intro. The fourth track \"Red Dress\" is a dominant dance-pop track with lots of synth element running through the song, clapping-like [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[Marching band|marching]]-influenced [[drumline]] which tells a story in which a girl wears a red dress and clumsily but slyly tempts a man who treats her only as a child. The soulful, R&B-flavored \"Oh Boy\" showcases the singing ability and highlights harmonization of the girlgroup, while being the next three songs which are produced by LDN Noise. Ryan S. Jhun co-produced the former two tracks, with additional production by [[Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]] on \"Campfire\" and Dsign Music on \"Red Dress\". \n\nThe latter half of ''The Red'' starts with the sixth track \"Lady's Room\", an uptempo R&B, [[synth-pop]] song that sings about the sisterhood between girls and the happy moments they share. It was one of three tracks produced by [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]] along with the next track \"Time Slip\", which is a 90s-influenced [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-based R&B song with lyrics that describes the laziness and listlessness that one feels while going back and forth between dream and reality in the morning. \"Time Slip\" also sees the participation of British songwriter Charli Taft, whom had previously co-written and produced \"[[Automatic (Red Velvet song)|Automatic]]\" along with Daniel Klein, while marking the first collaboration from South Korean music producer Jinbo for the girl group. The eighth track \"Don't U Wait No More\" highlights the group's harmonization over a heavy synth production with a harmonized \"Don't you wait no more\" [[Hook (music)|hook]], with the lyrics revolve around a girl trying to get closer to her hesitant boyfriend, followed by the [[bossa nova]]-influenced [[midtempo]] pop-rock track \"Day 1\", which describes the feeling of new love by combining the electric, funky guitar sound and the melodic piano with the vocals of the members. The album ends with \"Cool World\", a [[synth-pop]] uptempo song with hopeful lyrics about embracing and living as themselves. \n\n==Promotion==\nPromoting activities for the album started with a \"[[Comeback (K-pop)|comeback showcase]]\" by Red Velvet where they performed \"Dumb Dumb.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&aid=0000755959&lfrom=twitter|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3 \uc774\ubc88 \ucef4\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uccab \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ub4e4|author=Kim Ye-na|date=September 4, 2015|website=TV Report|language=Korean|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> They also appeared on a 5-episode live broadcast through the [[Naver]] V-Live [[Mobile app|app]] called ''\uc624\ubc29\ub9cc\uc871!

This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today,<ref name=\"cldr\">See the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] for detailed data about the preferred date and time notations used across the world, as well the [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] settings of major computer [[operating system]]s, and the article [[Date and time representation by country]].</ref> and is used by international standard [[ISO 8601]].<ref name=\"iso8601\">International Standard [[ISO 8601]]: Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 3rd ed., 2004.</ref>\n\nA number of countries, particularly English-speaking, use the [[12-hour clock]], or a mixture of the 24- and 12-hour time systems. In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]], the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and some other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.<ref name=cldr /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\". (When used as a modern time zone, in practice, GMT and UTC coincide.

This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today,<ref name=\"cldr\">See the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] for detailed data about the preferred date and time notations used across the world, as well the [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] settings of major computer [[operating system]]s, and the article [[Date and time representation by country]].</ref> and is used by international standard [[ISO 8601]].<ref name=\"iso8601\">International Standard [[ISO 8601]]: Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times.

In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]], the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and some other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.<ref name=cldr /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\".

Manufactured by [[Gerstlauer]], it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Record-AmusementToday\" /> However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-35851291|title=Alton Towers' Smiler ride reopens nine months after horror crash|website=BBC News|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPlans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011.

The trains ahead, now cleared of riders, were dispatched in turn until this fifth train could enter the station to be dispatched for a routine test run.

Manufactured by [[Gerstlauer]], it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Record-AmusementToday\" /> However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-35851291|title=Alton Towers' Smiler ride reopens nine months after horror crash|website=BBC News|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPlans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011.
