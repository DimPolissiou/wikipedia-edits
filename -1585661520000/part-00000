To this day the school maintains close links with [[Peterborough Cathedral]].  Until 1976 the school was a Church of England grammar school for around 450 boys. 1976 saw the school become both [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]] and [[coeducation]]al. Until 1997, however, there remained provision for boys to board.

School Inspectors declared this practice to be in contravention of the [[Education Act 1948|Education Act]]'s requirement to hold the daily assembly on-site.  Also in the 1960s, teaching included Saturday morning classes; and boarders were obliged to attend Sunday matins and/or evensong at the Cathedral.\n\n==Selective state school==\nSince 1976, King's School has been a co-educational state school with around 650 boys and girls. The school acquired Academy status on 1 January 2011 and thus became an independent school while still providing state funded education for all its pupils.<ref name=\"The School's History\"/> On entry to King's in Year 7 pupils are placed in one of 6 tutor groups, which change upon entry into the fourth year. The school's Junior Department opened in September 2011 for \"key stage two\" pupils (Ages 7 - 11), including [[Peterborough Cathedral|cathedral]] choristers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Junior Department|url=http://www.kings.peterborough.sch.uk/page/?title=Junior+Department&pid=25|website=The King's School Peterborough}}</ref>\n\nKing's was unusual in once being a grammar school that took boarders, all in School House.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Many boarders had parents in the Forces and or the Colonial Services; the very low fees<ref>In 1962, fees were \u00a338 per term!</ref> being more affordable than at public schools.

His [[Public speaking|orations]] constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the [[politics]] and culture of [[ancient Greece]] during the 4th century&nbsp;BC. Demosthenes learned [[rhetoric]] by studying the [[Speech (public address)|speeches]] of previous great orators. He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer ([[Logographer (legal)|logographer]]) and a [[Ancient Greek law|lawyer]], writing speeches for use in private [[Lawsuit|legal suits]].\n\nDemosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354&nbsp;BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]'s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against [[Philip II of Macedon]]. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.\n\nAfter Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Alexander the Great]]. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, [[Antipater]], sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by [[Archias of Thurii]], Antipater's confidant.\n\nThe ''Alexandrian Canon'' compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] recognised Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest [[Attic orators]] and logographers. [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] likened Demosthenes to a blazing thunderbolt and argued that he \"perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed.\"<ref>Longinus, ''On the Sublime'', 12.4, 34.4<br />* D.

The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians.

I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honour; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.</blockquote>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], Demosthenes had a reputation for eloquence.<ref>A.

In 1956, [[Hartmut Erbse]] partly challenged B\u00f6ckh's conclusions, when he argued that ''Against Meidias'' was a finished speech that could have been delivered in court, but Erbse then sided with [[George Grote]], by accepting that, after Demosthenes secured a judgment in his favour, he reached some kind of settlement with Meidias. [[Kenneth Dover]] also endorsed Aeschines's account, and argued that, although the speech was never delivered in court, Demosthenes put into circulation an attack on Meidias.

His [[Public speaking|orations]] constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the [[politics]] and culture of [[ancient Greece]] during the 4th century&nbsp;BC. Demosthenes learned [[rhetoric]] by studying the [[Speech (public address)|speeches]] of previous great orators. He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer ([[Logographer (legal)|logographer]]) and a [[Ancient Greek law|lawyer]], writing speeches for use in private [[Lawsuit|legal suits]].\n\nDemosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354&nbsp;BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]'s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against [[Philip II of Macedon]]. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.\n\nAfter Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Alexander the Great]]. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, [[Antipater]], sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by [[Archias of Thurii]], Antipater's confidant.\n\nThe ''Alexandrian Canon'' compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] recognised Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest [[Attic orators]] and logographers. [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] likened Demosthenes to a blazing thunderbolt and argued that he \"perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed.\"<ref>Longinus, ''On the Sublime'', 12.4, 34.4<br />* D. C. Innes, 'Longinus and Caecilius\", 277\u2013279.</ref> [[Quintilian]] extolled him as {{Lang |la|lex orandi}} (\"the standard of oratory\"). [[Cicero]] said of him that {{Lang |la|inter omnis unus excellat}} (\"he stands alone among all the orators\"), and also acclaimed him as \"the perfect orator\" who lacked nothing.<ref name=\"Cic35\">Cicero, ''Brutus'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/brut.shtml#35 35] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629101345/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/brut.shtml |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''Orator'', II.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#6 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622170646/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml |date=22 June 2015 }}; Quintillian, ''Institutiones'', X, 1.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio10.shtml#1 76] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120203116/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio10.shtml |date=20 January 2012 }}<br />* D.

Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On The Crown'', 263 (note 275).</ref>\n\nSince Athenian politicians were often indicted by their opponents, there was not always a clear distinction between \"private\" and \"public\" cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career.<ref>J Vince, ''Demosthenes Orations'', Intro. xii.</ref> An Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, which enabled him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. It also left him open to allegations of malpractice. Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a [[capital punishment|capital charge]] against Phormion.<ref name=\"AischIII173\">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D173 173] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520112051/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D173 |date=20 May 2012 }}; Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D165 165.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520143146/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D165 |date=20 May 2012 }}</ref> Plutarch much later supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes \"was thought to have acted dishonourably\"<ref name=\"Pl15\">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 15.</ref> and he also accused Demosthenes of writing speeches for both sides.

The Assembly, however, laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty; so doing, in effect, amounted to an official declaration of war. In 339&nbsp;BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece, assisted by Aeschines' stance in the [[Amphictyonic League|Amphictyonic Council]]. During a meeting of the Council, Philip accused the [[Amfissa|Amfissian]] [[Locrians]] of intruding on consecrated ground. The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians.

Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.\n\n=== Legal egalitarianism ===\n\n{{details|Equality before the law}}\n{{liberalism sidebar}}\nOne argument is that [[liberalism]] provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and providing the correct conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.<ref>{{cite conference |author=Rosales, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda |url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Poli/PoliRosa.htm |title=Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy |conference=20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy |date=12 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Equality of person ====\nThe [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights of 1689]] and the [[United States Constitution]] use only the term person in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities, except for (a) a reference to men in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason; and (b) a rule of  proportional Congressional representation in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n\nAs the rest of the Constitution, in its operative language the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] uses the term person, stating that \"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\".\n\n==== Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities ====\nAn example of this form is the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] which provides that \"men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties\".\n\n==== Gender equality ====\nThe motto \"''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]''\" was used during the [[French Revolution]] and is still used as an official motto of the French government. The 1789 [[Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind.\n\nThe [[Declaration of Independence of the United States]] is an example of an assertion of equality of men as \"[[All men are created equal]]\" and the wording of men and man is a reference to both men and women, i.e. mankind. [[John Locke]] is sometimes considered the founder of this form.\n\nMany state constitutions in the United States also use rights of man language rather than rights of person since the noun man has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women.{{citation needed |reason=sources needed both for the \"always\" bit and that it is the reason state constitutions chose to say \"man\" rather than \"persons\" |date=June 2018}}\n\n[[Feminism]] is greatly informed by egalitarian philosophy, being a gender-focused philosophy of equality. However, feminism is distinguished from egalitarianism by also existing as a political and social movement.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Social egalitarianism ===\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nAt a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years.

Thus, the fabric of an egalitarianist society is held together by [[cooperation]] and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, [[Individualism|individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomism|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable as the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.<ref name=\"Thompson 1990\"/> Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group, namely autonomists or individualists.\n\nBerkman suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity ... Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact ... Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality ... Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Berkman |title=What is Anarchism? |pages=164\u2013165}}{{full citation|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Marxism ===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that an [[Proletarian internationalism|international]] [[proletarian revolution]] would bring about a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist stage of social development]] which would be a classless, stateless, moneyless, humane society erected on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and the principle of \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]\". However, [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of equality), but it was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires, making Marx's notion of [[communist society]] radically individualistic.<ref name=\"Karl Marx on Equality\">{{cite web |author=Woods, Allen |year=2014 |url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf |title=Karl Marx on Equality |quote=Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes. ... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx's radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic.}}</ref>\n\nInstead, Marx was a proponent of two principles, with the first (\"[[To each according to his contribution]]\") being applied to socialism and the second (\"To each according to their needs\") to an advanced communist society. Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.<ref name=\"Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987\">{{cite journal |author=Nielsen, Kai |date=August 1987 |title=Rejecting Egalitarianism |journal=Political Theory |volume=15

Thus, the fabric of an egalitarianist society is held together by [[cooperation]] and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, [[Individualism|individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomism|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable as the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.<ref name=\"Thompson 1990\"/> Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group, namely autonomists or individualists.\n\nBerkman suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity ... Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact ... Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality ... Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Berkman |title=What is Anarchism? |pages=164\u2013165}}{{full citation|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Marxism ===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that an [[Proletarian internationalism|international]] [[proletarian revolution]] would bring about a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist stage of social development]] which would be a classless, stateless, moneyless, humane society erected on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and the principle of \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]\". However, [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of equality), but it was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires, making Marx's notion of [[communist society]] radically individualistic.<ref name=\"Karl Marx on Equality\">{{cite web |author=Woods, Allen |year=2014 |url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf |title=Karl Marx on Equality |quote=Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes. ... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx's radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic.}}</ref>\n\nInstead, Marx was a proponent of two principles, with the first (\"[[To each according to his contribution]]\") being applied to socialism and the second (\"To each according to their needs\") to an advanced communist society. Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.<ref name=\"Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987\">{{cite journal |author=Nielsen, Kai |date=August 1987 |title=Rejecting Egalitarianism |journal=Political Theory |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=411\u2013423 |doi=10.1177/0090591787015003008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* \"[[All men are created equal]]\"\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Basic income]]\n* [[Deep ecology]]\n* [[Discrimination]]\n* [[Elitism]]\n* [[Equal opportunity]]\n* [[Equality of outcome]]\n* [[Feminism]]\n* [[Same-sex marriage]]\n* [[Gift economy]]\n* [[Inequity aversion]]\n* [[Law of Jante]]\n* [[Left-wing politics]]\n* [[Meritocracy]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]]\n* [[Reciprocal altruism]]\n* [[Redistributive justice]]\n* [[Social equality]]\n* [[Speciesism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|egalitarian}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''\n** {{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/egalitar/ |title=Egalitarianism}}\n** {{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-eg/ |title=Moral Egalitarianism}}\n* ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''\n** {{cite web |author=Arneson, Richard |year=2002 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/ |title=Egalitarianism}}\n** {{cite web |author=Gosepath, Stefan |year=2007 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equality/ |title=Equality}}\n** {{cite web |author=Arneson, Richard |year=2002 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/ |title=Equality of opportunity}}\n* {{cite book |author=Lepowsky, Maria |year=1993 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225103920/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/023108/0231081200.HTM |title=Fruit of the Motherland: Gender in an Egalitarian Society |place=New York, NY |publisher=Columbia University Press}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.ucd.ie/esc |title=The Equality Studies Centre}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.twinoaks.org/ |title=Twin Oaks Intentional Community}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.thefec.org/ |title=Federation of Egalitarian Communities}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Egalitarianism| ]]\n[[Category:Political culture]]\n[[Category:Social theories]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Decentralization]]\n[[Category:Social inequality]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Social justice]]\n[[Category:Fair division]]\n[[Category:Equality rights]]\n[[Category:Human rights]]\n[[Category:Economic ideologies]]\n", "name_user": "178.43.235.167", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism"}
