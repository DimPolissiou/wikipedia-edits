Fertile eggs embryonate and become infective after 18 days to several weeks (3), depending on the environmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil). After infective eggs are swallowed (4), the larvae hatch (5), invade the intestinal mucosa and are carried via the portal, then systemic circulation and/or lymphatics to the lungs . The larvae mature further in the lungs (6) (10 to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed (7).

In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4\u201316 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. There are generally few or no symptoms. A [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause [[pneumonitis]] and [[eosinophilia]].

The eggs can be seen in a smear of fresh feces examined on a glass slide under a microscope and there are various techniques to concentrate them first or increase their visibility, such as the ether sedimentation method or the [[Kato technique]]. The eggs have a characteristic shape: they are oval with a thick, mamillated shell (covered with rounded mounds or lumps), measuring 35-50 micrometer in diameter and 40\u201370 in length. During pulmonary disease, larvae may be found in fluids aspirated from the lungs.

Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. [[Thiabendazole]] may cause migration of the worm into the [[esophagus]], so it is usually combined with piperazine.\n\n[[Piperazine]] is a flaccid paralyzing agent that blocks the response of Ascaris muscle to acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.\n\n[[Corticosteroids]] can treat some of the symptoms, such as inflammation.\n\n==== Other medications ====\n* [[Hexylresorcinol]] effective in single dose<ref name=\"Holt11th\">Holt, Jr Emmett L, McIntosh Rustin: Holt's Diseases of Infancy and Childhood: A Textbook for the Use of Students and Practitioners.

A female may produce approximately 200,000 eggs per day, which are passed with the feces (2). Unfertilized eggs may be ingested but are not infective. Fertile eggs embryonate and become infective after 18 days to several weeks (3), depending on the environmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil). After infective eggs are swallowed (4), the larvae hatch (5), invade the intestinal mucosa and are carried via the portal, then systemic circulation and/or lymphatics to the lungs . The larvae mature further in the lungs (6) (10 to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed (7). Upon reaching the small intestine, they develop into adult worms (8). Between 2 and 3 months are required from ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female. Adult worms can live 1 to 2 years.]]\n\n=== Transmission ===\nThe source of infection is from objects which have been contaminated with fecal matter containing eggs.<ref name=Hagel2010 /> Ingestion of infective eggs from soil contaminated with human feces or contaminated vegetables and water is the primary route of infection. Infectious eggs may occur on other objects such as hands, money and furniture.<ref name=Hagel2010 /> Transmission from human to human by direct contact is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/ascaris/factsht_ascaris.htm#contagious|title=''Ascaris''Infection Fact Sheet|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531191820/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/ascaris/factsht_ascaris.htm#contagious|archivedate=2010-05-31|date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nTransmission comes through municipal recycling of wastewater into crop fields. This is quite common in emerging industrial economies and poses serious risks for local crop sales and exports of contaminated vegetables. A 1986 outbreak of ascariasis in [[Italy]] was traced to irresponsible wastewater recycling used to grow [[Balkan]] vegetable exports.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pawlowski | first = ZS |author2=Schultzberg K | chapter =Ascariasis and sewage in Europe| editor = Block JC |title=Epidemiological Studies of Risks Associated With the Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge: Knowledge and Needs (EUR) |publisher=Elsevier Science Pub Co |location= |year=1986|pages=83\u201393 |isbn=978-1-85166-035-3 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThe number of [[ovum|ova]] (eggs) in [[sewage]] or in crops that were irrigated with raw or partially treated sewage, is a measure of the degree of ascariasis incidence.

In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4\u201316 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. There are generally few or no symptoms. A [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause [[pneumonitis]] and [[eosinophilia]]. Adult worms have a lifespan of 1\u20132 years which means that individuals may be infected all their lives as worms die and new worms are acquired.<ref name=Anderson1>Anderson, R.M. & May, R.M.

The eggs can be seen in a smear of fresh feces examined on a glass slide under a microscope and there are various techniques to concentrate them first or increase their visibility, such as the ether sedimentation method or the [[Kato technique]]. The eggs have a characteristic shape: they are oval with a thick, mamillated shell (covered with rounded mounds or lumps), measuring 35-50 micrometer in diameter and 40\u201370 in length. During pulmonary disease, larvae may be found in fluids aspirated from the lungs.

It typically had 12 to 18 two-man rowing benches on each side, a single mast with a [[lateen]] (triangular) sail, and usually carried two or three guns.  The sail was used to cruise and save the rowers\u2019 energy, while the oars propelled the ship in and out of harbor and during combat.\n\nThe fusta was the favorite ship of the North African [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]] of [[Sal\u00e9]] and the [[Barbary Coast]].

{"title_page": "Nicholas Nugent", "text_new": "{{short description|Anglo-Irish judge}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Nicholas Nugent''' (c. 1525\u20131582) was an Anglo-Irish judge, who was hanged for [[treason]] by the government that appointed him. He  had, before his downfall, enjoyed  a highly successful career, holding office as [[Solicitor General for Ireland]], Baron of the Irish [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)|Court of Exchequer]], and [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]], but  he was ruined by the [[rebellion]] of his nephew [[William Nugent]], which he was accused of supporting.\n\n== Background and early career ==\nNicholas Nugent was born between 1525 and 1530. Like many Irish judges of the time he belonged to the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocracy of [[the Pale]]. His father Sir Christopher Nugent (died 1531) was the son and heir of Richard Nugent, 4th [[Baron Delvin]]; his mother was Marian St Lawrence, daughter of [[Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 213</ref> His father predeceased his grandfather and the title passed to Nicholas' elder brother Richard, who died in 1559,  leaving two sons: [[Christopher Nugent]], the sixth Baron, and William. His mother made two further marriages: her second husband was Sir Gerald FitzGerald, Knight Marshal of Ireland, and  after his death she married thirdly John Parker, who was a  senior  judge and a key figure in the Dublin administration.\n\nNicholas married Janet Plunket, daughter of Sir [[John Plunket]], [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]] and his second   wife Catherine Luttrell, and widow of Thomas Marward, titular [[Baron Skryne]]; they had one surviving son, Richard. Nicholas  was given  the wardship of his step-daughter, who was  also named Janet. The younger Janet, styled Baroness Skryne,  was a considerable  heiress and Nicholas resolved that she should  marry his nephew William. The marriage took place but only after William caused a scandal by [[kidnapping|abducting]]   her.<ref>Ball, p.213</ref>\n\nNicholas entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1558. His future rival  for judicial office, Sir  [[Robert Dillon (judge)|Robert Dillon]],  was there at the same time and their lifelong enmity seems to have begun when they were students: in 1560 they were ordered  by the Benchers of the Inn to stop fighting and [[bound over]]  to keep the peace.<ref>Crawford, Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.107</ref>\n\n== Later career ==\nOn his return to Ireland, Nugent advanced rapidly in his career: he was made Solicitor General for Ireland in 1565, elevated to the bench as Baron of the Exchequer, and recommended for the office of  [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], which had been held from 1552 to 1564 by his stepfather, [[John Parker (Irish judge)|John Parker]].<ref>Ball p.213</ref> His irascible temper, so evident when he was a student, did not improve, and in 1576 another High Court judge, [[Richard Talbot (Irish judge)|Richard Talbot]], sued him before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] (the Irish equivalent of  [[Star Chamber]]) for [[riot]] and [[unlawful assembly]]; the charges were dismissed for lack of  sufficient evidence.<ref>Crawford p.214</ref>\n\nHis career suffered a further check when he joined in the ''cess'' controversy, which involved  a concerted  policy of opposition  by the landowning class to the taxation policies of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Sir [[Henry Sidney]]. He was twice suspended from office in 1577\u201378 and imprisoned, but was restored to favour after making his submission. The controversy does not seem to have  created any serious concerns  about his loyalty, no doubt because many eminent lawyers opposed the cess. Even  the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], had doubts about the wisdom of Sidney's taxation policy, as ultimately did the Queen herself.  Gerard thought highly of Nugent, and it was on his recommendation that he was made Chief Justice in 1580.<ref>Ball, p.146</ref> Within little over a year, however, the actions of his nephews brought about his downfall.\n\nThe loyalty of both  his nephews  to [[Elizabeth I]] was deeply suspect:  Lord Delvin was to die in prison awaiting trial in 1602 and, while William was eventually pardoned, this came too late to save his uncle. Both were suspected of supporting the rebellion of [[James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass]], and when William was exempted from the general pardon after the rebellion, he took up arms. Nicholas'  lifelong enemy, Sir Robert Dillon, who had been passed over as Chief Justice in Nugent's favour, went to [[London]] and evidently persuaded the Crown to suspend Nicholas from office as a suspected [[traitor]], an action which public opinion in Ireland attributed to  Dillon's spite and envy.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref>\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nThe Lord Deputy, [[Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton]], has been described as seeing his role of Deputy as \"a largely military one\". Perhaps for this reason the unusual decision was taken to conduct Nugent's trial, for treason, in a manner which, according to critical historians, \"had the appearance of [[martial law]].\"    It was held in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], rather than Dublin, allegedly for convenience, and Grey appointed a special commission to assist him, which included Sir Robert Dillon, his cousin the Chief Baron [[Lucas Dillon]], and [[Richard Segrave]], who had replaced Nugent at the  Court of Exchequer. In contrast to the modern view that judges should come to a case without bias, these men seem to have been chosen precisely because they knew Nugent personally. He  did however  have the benefit of [[trial by jury]] in the normal way.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref>\n\nThe law then required  two witnesses to an act of treason,  but at Nugent's trial only one witness,  John Cusack, appeared to testify that Nugent   knew of and encouraged William's rebellion.<ref>Crawford, pp.237\u20138</ref> Nugent, like all those charged with treason in Ireland  until the  middle of the  eighteenth century, was denied  the right to [[legal counsel]],<ref>The right was not granted in England  until 1695 by the [[Treason Act 1695]], nor  Ireland until 1765, under the [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1765]].</ref> but given his own legal expertise this was presumably less of a difficulty for him than it would have been for a layman, and he conducted his own defence with great spirit.    He accused Robert Dillon of having bribed Cusack to commit [[perjury]], and it seems that much of the trial was taken up by Dillon defending himself against charges of misconduct. To bolster the evidence, Grey claimed that Nicholas had privately confessed his guilt to Mr Waterhouse, a royal clerk. Whether or not the judges came to the trial with their minds made up, they seem to have had little doubt as to the verdict which the jury should bring in.\n\nNugent was found guilty, and hanged at Trim on 13 April.<ref>Crawford p.238</ref> There were claims that the jury were coerced by the judges, which is likely enough.  [[John Philipps Kenyon]] writes that until the 1670s  it  was considered quite proper for a judge to bring strong pressure  on a jury to find the \"right\" verdict (i.e. guilty),  and the practice of  a judge  \"suggesting\" that the   jury  bring in the required verdict continued into the  1690s.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.  ''The Stuart Constitution''  Cambridge University Press 2nd Edition 1986 pp.392-3;  the practice of coercing juries continued for several decades afterwards.</ref> Further,  the jury would probably have been aware that the Crown  had the right to punish jurors for acquitting an accused person  in the  face of strong evidence of their  guilt, as would happen to a [[County Kildare]]  jury in 1586.<ref>Crawford p.480</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nA story quickly circulated that Robert Dillon, at the hanging, remarked:  \"Friend Nugent, I am even with you now for coming between me and my place (i.e  the office of Chief Justice)\". Elrington Ball doubts the truth of the story, but as he remarks the fact that it was  told at all is a comment on the unease which the case aroused.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref> A few years later the then Lord Deputy of Ireland  recommended that only English judges be appointed in Ireland, as Irish born judges decided cases purely on family or local loyalties.<ref>Ball, p.150</ref> [[Roger Wilbraham]], who became [[Solicitor General for Ireland]] soon after the trial,  thought that Robert Dillon's conduct in particular had been disgraceful, but argued pragmatically that those like Dillon who did the Queen good service should not be \"pressed hard\" for anything less than a [[capital offence]].\n\n== Assessment ==\nElrington Ball states that Nugent's fate was unique: two men who had served as judges in Ireland, [[Miles Corbet]] and [[John Cook (regicide)|John Cook]], were executed in [[London]] at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] for treason against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], but in no other case  than Nugent's did the Government in Ireland execute one of its own judges.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref>\n\nWhether Nugent was guilty of treason, or even of the lesser crime of [[misprison of treason|misprision of treason]], is difficult to say. The verdict aroused  a good deal of  popular unease, due to the dubious quality of the evidence and the apparent bias of the judges. The Crown had rewarded Nugent generously, and it is difficult to see what he had to gain by rebellion.  However he and his nephew were close, and it is possible that he knew of William's plans: even if he disapproved of them, this would arguably make him guilty of  misprision of treason.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nugent, Nicholas}}\n[[Category:1582 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:People from County Meath]]\n[[Category:People executed for treason]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Irish Common Pleas]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Anglo-Irish judge}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Nicholas Nugent''' (c. 1525\u20131582) was an Anglo-Irish judge, who was hanged for [[treason]] by the government that appointed him.
