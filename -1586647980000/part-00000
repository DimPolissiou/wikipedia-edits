There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6).

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6).

In [[culinary]] contexts, a suckling pig is [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] between the ages of two and six weeks. It is traditionally cooked whole, often [[Roasting|roasted]], in various cuisines. It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings.\n\nThe meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for [[pork rinds]]. The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of [[collagen]] in a young pig.\n\n==History==\nThere are many ancient recipes for suckling pig from [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman]] and [[Chinese cuisine]]. Since the pig is one of the first [[List of domesticated animals|animals domesticated]] by human beings for slaughter, many references to pigs are found in human culture.

In Spanish cuisine, '''cochinillo asado''' is commonly used to refer to roast piglet, as lech\u00f3n has drifted linguistically to mean any roasted pig. In most of these regions, lech\u00f3n is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, during festivals, and the Thanksgiving.\n\nAfter seasoning, the piglet is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The piglet is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a [[rotisserie]] action.\n\n===Asia===\n[[File:Shaoruzhu.jpg|thumb|Cantonese style roasted whole suckling pig]]\nIn Asia, roast suckling pig is eaten in Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants for important parties.<ref name=\"eastweek\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://dev.eastweek.com.hk/index.php?aid=22284\n|title=\u98f2\u5bb46\u62db \u8272\u98df\u80a5 \uff08Chinese\uff09\n|author=\n|work=eastweek\n|date=6 October 2012\n|accessdate=28 October 2012\n}}</ref> It is also a popular dish at wedding dinners or a party for a baby's completion of its first month of life.<ref name=\"sina\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://travel.sina.com.hk/news/186/4/1/34892/1.html\n|title=\u4e45\u4eab\u76db\u540d\u7684\u56db\u66f4\u70e4\u4e73\u8c6c (Chinese)\n|author=\n|work=travel.sina.com.hk\n|date=9 September 2009\n|accessdate=28 October 2012\n}}</ref><ref name=\"rthk\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://rthk.hk/special/hongkongtotheworld/episode01_e.htm\n|title=Siu Mei Kung Fu\n|author=\n|work=rthk.hk\n|date=6 October 2012\n|accessdate=28 October 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the former Spanish [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colony]] of [[the Philippines]], lech\u00f3n (Filipino: ''lits\u00f3n'') is considered a [[national dish]].

In [[culinary]] contexts, a suckling pig is [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] between the ages of two and six weeks. It is traditionally cooked whole, often [[Roasting|roasted]], in various cuisines. It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings.\n\nThe meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for [[pork rinds]]. The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of [[collagen]] in a young pig.\n\n==History==\nThere are many ancient recipes for suckling pig from [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman]] and [[Chinese cuisine]]. Since the pig is one of the first [[List of domesticated animals|animals domesticated]] by human beings for slaughter, many references to pigs are found in human culture. The suckling pig, specifically, appears in early texts such as the sixth-century [[Salic law]]. As an example of a law governing the punishment for theft, Title 2, article 1, is, in Latin, ''Si quis porcellum lactantem furaverit, et ei fuerit adprobatum (malb. chrane calcium hoc est) CXX dinarios qui faciunt solidos III culpabilis iudicetur''. \"If someone has stolen a suckling pig and this is proven against him, the guilty party will be sentenced to 120 [[Denarius|denarii]] which adds up to three [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] (Latin coins).\" The words \"chrane calcium\" are written in Frankish; \"calcium\" (or \"galza\" in other manuscripts) is the [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]] for \"suckling pig\"; ''porcellum lactantem''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Gorl\u00e9\n  | first = Frits\n  | authorlink =\n  | author2 = John Gilissen\n  | title = Historische inleiding tot het recht, Volume 1\n  | publisher = Kluwer\n  | year = 1989\n  | location =\n  | page = 166\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axXa7FK6JTEC&pg=PA166\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-90-6321-654-2}}</ref> These glosses in Frankish, the so-called ''Malberg-Glossen'', are considered the earliest attested words in [[Old Dutch]].<ref>Ruth Schmidt-Wiegand, \"Die Malbergischen Glossen, eine fr\u00fche \u00dcberlieferung germanischer Rechtsprache,\" in {{Cite book\n  | last = Beck\n  | first = Heinrich\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Germanische Rest- und Tr\u00fcmmersprachen; Volume 3 of Erg\u00e4nzungsb\u00e4nde zum Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde\n  | publisher = Walter de Gruyter\n  | year = 1989\n  | location =\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-3-11-011948-0}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n{{POV-section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Piglets in a pigpen (closeup).jpg|thumb|Piglets in a pigpen (closeup)]]\nIt is often argued that the use of pigs for human consumption is unethical,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awionline.org/content/pigs|title=Pigs|website=Animal Welfare Institute}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldanimalprotection.us/raise-pigs-right/environment|title=Raise Pigs Right - Enviornment|website=World Animal Protection USA}}</ref> especially in the case of young animals removed from their mothers earlier than weaning would happen in nature:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.veganpeace.com/animal_facts/Pigs.htm|title=Animal Facts - Pigs|website=www.veganpeace.com}}</ref> natural weaning takes place at around 12 weeks of age, whereas suckling pigs are slaughtered at 2 to 6 weeks of age.

The word ''lech\u00f3n'' originated from the Spanish term ''leche'' (milk), alluding to the immaturity of the piglet. Lech\u00f3n is a popular item in the cuisine in [[Los Angeles]], Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, [[Per\u00fa]], Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and other [[Hispanidad|Spanish-speaking nations]] in Latin America. In Spanish cuisine, '''cochinillo asado''' is commonly used to refer to roast piglet, as lech\u00f3n has drifted linguistically to mean any roasted pig. In most of these regions, lech\u00f3n is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, during festivals, and the Thanksgiving.\n\nAfter seasoning, the piglet is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The piglet is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a [[rotisserie]] action.\n\n===Asia===\n[[File:Shaoruzhu.jpg|thumb|Cantonese style roasted whole suckling pig]]\nIn Asia, roast suckling pig is eaten in Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants for important parties.<ref name=\"eastweek\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://dev.eastweek.com.hk/index.php?aid=22284\n|title=\u98f2\u5bb46\u62db \u8272\u98df\u80a5 \uff08Chinese\uff09\n|author=\n|work=eastweek\n|date=6 October 2012\n|accessdate=28 October 2012\n}}</ref> It is also a popular dish at wedding dinners or a party for a baby's completion of its first month of life.<ref name=\"sina\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://travel.sina.com.hk/news/186/4/1/34892/1.html\n|title=\u4e45\u4eab\u76db\u540d\u7684\u56db\u66f4\u70e4\u4e73\u8c6c (Chinese)\n|author=\n|work=travel.sina.com.hk\n|date=9 September 2009\n|accessdate=28 October 2012\n}}</ref><ref name=\"rthk\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://rthk.hk/special/hongkongtotheworld/episode01_e.htm\n|title=Siu Mei Kung Fu\n|author=\n|work=rthk.hk\n|date=6 October 2012\n|accessdate=28 October 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the former Spanish [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colony]] of [[the Philippines]], lech\u00f3n (Filipino: ''lits\u00f3n'') is considered a [[national dish]].

The structure was constructed in 1927\u20131928 as New York Life's headquarters and still serves that function. It overlooks [[Madison Square Park]] in the [[Rose Hill, Manhattan|Rose Hill]] and [[NoMad, Manhattan|NoMad]] neighborhoods of Manhattan.\n\nThe New York Life Building was designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] details similar to his previous commissions, which included [[90 West Street]] and [[Woolworth Building]]. At the time of the building's construction, many structures were being built in the [[Art Deco]] style, and so Gilbert's design incorporated Art Deco influences in its [[massing]] while retaining the older-style Gothic Revival detailing. The New York Life Building is distinguished from the skyline by its gilded roof.\n\nThe building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1972, and was designated a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 2000.\n\n== Description ==\nDesigned in 1926 by [[Cass Gilbert]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vertical-access.com/NY-Life-building.html|title=New York Life Building|publisher=Vertical Access|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}</ref> and inspired by [[Salisbury Cathedral]],<ref name=\"msq\">''Event Horizon: Mad.
