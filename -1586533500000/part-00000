The trains are formed from sets of 2 or 3 semi-permanently connected cars, the increase to 3-car trains being introduced progressively on the busiest routes in 2010, following substantial platform extension works. The automation system is a GOA3, which requires a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) to operate doors and  drive manually the train when required.\n\nThere have been three different main types of DLR rolling stock, but only two of them (the B90/B92/B2K fleet and the B07/B09 fleet) are in operation; the original P86/P89 stock having been withdrawn and sold to [[Essen]], Germany.\n\n==Passenger stock overview==\nThe passenger trains consist of 149 high-floor, bi-directional, single-[[articulated car]]s, each 28 metres (92 feet) long. The cars have four doors on each side and each train is normally composed of two cars coupled together.

All the cars that have operated on the system look similar, but there have been five separate types, three of which are still in operation on the Docklands Light Railway. A further car type, with quite different styling, was first displayed in March 2008 and entered service in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/docklands-light-railway-car-formally-unveiled.html Docklands Light Rail car formally unveiled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505204750/http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/docklands-light-railway-car-formally-unveiled.html |date=5 May 2018 }} ''[[Metro Report International]]'' 29 March 2008</ref>\n\nThe DLR trains have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but the fastest possible speed reached is {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} through the tunnel under the [[River Thames]] between [[Woolwich Arsenal station]] and [[King George V DLR station|King George V]].\n\n==P86 and P89 rolling stock==\n[[File:Original DLR train Delta Junction at West India Quay.jpg|thumb|left|P86 stock passing through the flat junction at [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] bound for [[Stratford station|Stratford]], 1987]]\nThe fleet for the 1987 opening consisted of 11 [[light rail]] vehicles (LRVs) built in 1986 by [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch]] in Germany and numbered 01 to 11. These were referred to as '''P86 stock''',<ref name=DLRbook>{{cite book|title=Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook|author=Pearce, Alan|author2=Hardy, Brian|author3=Stannard, Colin|year=2000|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|isbn=1-85414-223-2}}</ref> the 'P' referring to [[Poplar DLR depot|Poplar depot]], where they were maintained. These cars had folding doors, which proved to be problematic; later cars had sliding doors. Vehicle 11 made history several times. It was part of a light rail demonstration at [[Debdale Park]], [[Manchester]] for which it had a pantograph fitted by [[Balfour Beatty]]. The demonstration took place on 9 February 1987 as evaluation trials for a [[Manchester Metrolink|potential tram system in Manchester]]. P11 was the last unit to be delivered to the DLR at Poplar on 30 March 1987, without the pantograph. It carried the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] during the opening of the DLR on 30 July 1987 from [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] (when originally above ground) to [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] and then to [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]. It also operated the first revenue-earning DLR service and was the first to move to [[Essen]] in 1991.<ref name=DLRbook/>\n\n[[File:EVAG P86 5211 Hauptbahnhof.jpg|thumb|right|P86 stock with original DLR livery at [[Essen Hauptbahnhof]], 2005]]\nThere were 84 seats in each car with most arranged in transverse bays of four to take advantage of the large windows. There were two wheelchair bays, and twelve longitudinal seats increased the circulation area. An emergency console for the Train Captain was provided but locked when out of use. These cars were built for the initial above-ground system and, because of failing to meet safety requirements, were not allowed to operate on the tunnelled extension to {{LUL stations|station=Bank}}.<ref name=DLRbook/> Because of this, and because adaptation to a new signalling system was too costly, these cars were sold in 1991 to Essener Verkehrs-AG of [[Essen]], Germany, where they were extensively rebuilt and put into service on the [[Essen Stadtbahn]] between 1994 and 1998.<ref>\"Docklands cars sold\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1090 February 1992 page 75</ref><ref name=\"DLR Specs\"/> Originally, they retained DLR colours and were limited to route U11, but after a further modification programme started in 2005 trains are appearing in a yellow livery and are used on all routes.\n\n[[File:EVAG P89 5226 Margarethenhoehe.jpg|thumb|left|P89 stock running in [[Essen]], Germany]]\nIn 1989\u20131990, [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]'s [[Holgate Road carriage works]], supplied another ten numbered 12 to 21. These shared the characteristics of the original P86 stock. They were, though, equipped with sufficient fire-proofing to operate through the tunnels of the Bank extension. These were designated '''P89 stock''' and remained in operation on the DLR until 1995, along with the P86s. The two initial car types were effectively identical in appearance; apart from the car numbers one difference was the red livery underneath the end window was noticeably more orange and reflective on the P89 cars than on the original P86 ones. By 1994, all P89s were modified with single-leaf sliding doors. They were also sold to Essen, where they entered service between 1999 and 2004 after major modifications had been carried out. In 2005 the last cars were repainted in Essen colours. As the Essen Stadtbahn does not use fully automated driving and uses [[overhead line]] rather than [[third rail]] power collection, the modifications to both sets of cars involved fitting driver's cabs and [[Pantograph (rail)|pantographs]]. Today, the former London trains operate all (U11, U17 and U18) lines.\n\n==B90/B92/B2K rolling stock==\n[[File:Royal Victoria DLR station MMB 04 DLR 02.jpg|thumb|Repainted B2K stock arrives at Royal Victoria station.]]\n[[File:Docklands Light Railway train 49 (interior).jpg|thumb|upright|The interior of B92 stock train 49.]]\nFurther vehicles were required as the network grew and as the original P86 and P89 cars had to be replaced due to their unsuitability for the changed system conditions. [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] built 23 vehicles of '''B90 stock''' in 1991, 47 vehicles of '''B92 stock''' between 1993 and 1995, and 24 vehicles of '''B2K stock''' in 2001 and 2002 at its [[Brugge]], Belgium plant. When new the B2K stock differed from the earlier vehicles in appearance as the doors and handrails were painted in colours contrasting to their surroundings and they added front doors to comply with the new safety regulations. They are also fitted with internal [[LCD]] display screens. These differences were all mandated by the [[Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations]] of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act]], which were not in force when the older cars were built.\n\nThe 'B' in the type codes refers to [[Docklands Light Railway#Depots|Beckton DLR depot]], where they are primarily maintained. They are of a common design and can be operated interchangeably in trains of up to three sets.\n\nThe DLR fleet at the end of 2004 consisted of:\n*22\u201344: Bombardier B90, built 1991\n*45\u201391: Bombardier B92, built 1993\u20131995\n*92\u201399, 01\u201316: Bombardier B2K, built 2001\u20132002\n\nThe numbering of the last B2K cars restarted at 01, reusing the numbers of the replaced, original cars. The main reason for this was that the DLR computer system had only been designed originally to handle 2-digit car numbers, and an upgrade to allow 3-digit car numbers did not take place until some time after these cars were received.\n\nDLR cars had a common livery of blue, red, and white upon delivery. Over the years, several vehicles have received all-over advertising livery. A new livery of turquoise and blue was tested on B92 car 40 in the mid-1990s, but it was not adopted, and the car was repainted in standard livery a few years later. The B90, B92 and B2K stocks were refurbished starting in 2004 with the completed trains re-entering service with a redesigned interior and in a new livery of red and blue with grey doors to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act. The refurbished units feature an Audio and Visual Information System which gives audio announcements when approaching a station: \"This train is for ''destination'', the next stop is ''next stop''\", for example:\n\"This train is for Bank, the next stop is Canary Wharf\".

stock]]') used on the [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR), which serves the [[London Docklands]] area in the east of [[London]].\n\nThe passenger stock consists of high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated [[Electrical Multiple Unit|EMUs]]. The trains are formed from sets of 2 or 3 semi-permanently connected cars, the increase to 3-car trains being introduced progressively on the busiest routes in 2010, following substantial platform extension works. The automation system is a GOA3, which requires a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) to operate doors and  drive manually the train when required.\n\nThere have been three different main types of DLR rolling stock, but only two of them (the B90/B92/B2K fleet and the B07/B09 fleet) are in operation; the original P86/P89 stock having been withdrawn and sold to [[Essen]], Germany.\n\n==Passenger stock overview==\nThe passenger trains consist of 149 high-floor, bi-directional, single-[[articulated car]]s, each 28 metres (92 feet) long. The cars have four doors on each side and each train is normally composed of two cars coupled together. A third car has been added on the busiest routes since 2010.<ref name=\"tfl3car\">{{cite web|title=Docklands Light Railway - Three-carriage Capacity Enhancement Project|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/index.asp|accessdate=2009-08-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803062955/http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/index.asp|archivedate=3 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"taylor3car\">{{cite web|title=Docklands Light Railway Three-Car Capacity Enhancement Project|url=http://www.vinciconstruction.co.uk/news-and-downloads/Docklands-Light-Railway-Three-Car-Capacity-Enhancement-Project.html|publisher=[[Taylor Woodrow Construction]] and [[Vinci (construction)]]|accessdate=17 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191615/http://www.vinciconstruction.co.uk/news-and-downloads/Docklands-Light-Railway-Three-Car-Capacity-Enhancement-Project.html|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"DLR3car\">{{cite web|title=DLR finalises three-car upgrade funds for London 2012 Games and beyond|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=198|accessdate=2010-02-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421233007/http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=198|archivedate=21 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Each car has 70 seats and has a total capacity of 284 passengers.<ref name=\"DLR Key Facts\">{{cite web|url= http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/specs.html|title= Docklands Light Railway Key Facts|publisher= railway-technology.com|year= 2009|accessdate= 2009-08-03|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090505080834/http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/specs.html|archivedate= 5 May 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe cars do not have a driver's cab, although there is a small driving console concealed behind a locked panel at each outer car end from which the Passenger Service Agent (PSA) can manually drive the train if necessary.

All the cars that have operated on the system look similar, but there have been five separate types, three of which are still in operation on the Docklands Light Railway. A further car type, with quite different styling, was first displayed in March 2008 and entered service in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/docklands-light-railway-car-formally-unveiled.html Docklands Light Rail car formally unveiled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505204750/http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/docklands-light-railway-car-formally-unveiled.html |date=5 May 2018 }} ''[[Metro Report International]]'' 29 March 2008</ref>\n\nThe DLR trains have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but the fastest possible speed reached is {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} through the tunnel under the [[River Thames]] between [[Woolwich Arsenal station]] and [[King George V DLR station|King George V]].\n\n==P86 and P89 rolling stock==\n[[File:Original DLR train Delta Junction at West India Quay.jpg|thumb|left|P86 stock passing through the flat junction at [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] bound for [[Stratford station|Stratford]], 1987]]\nThe fleet for the 1987 opening consisted of 11 [[light rail]] vehicles (LRVs) built in 1986 by [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch]] in Germany and numbered 01 to 11.

These cars had folding doors, which proved to be problematic; later cars had sliding doors. Vehicle 11 made history several times. It was part of a light rail demonstration at [[Debdale Park]], [[Manchester]] for which it had a pantograph fitted by [[Balfour Beatty]]. The demonstration took place on 9 February 1987 as evaluation trials for a [[Manchester Metrolink|potential tram system in Manchester]]. P11 was the last unit to be delivered to the DLR at Poplar on 30 March 1987, without the pantograph. It carried the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] during the opening of the DLR on 30 July 1987 from [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] (when originally above ground) to [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] and then to [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]. It also operated the first revenue-earning DLR service and was the first to move to [[Essen]] in 1991.<ref name=DLRbook/>\n\n[[File:EVAG P86 5211 Hauptbahnhof.jpg|thumb|right|P86 stock with original DLR livery at [[Essen Hauptbahnhof]], 2005]]\nThere were 84 seats in each car with most arranged in transverse bays of four to take advantage of the large windows. There were two wheelchair bays, and twelve longitudinal seats increased the circulation area. An emergency console for the Train Captain was provided but locked when out of use. These cars were built for the initial above-ground system and, because of failing to meet safety requirements, were not allowed to operate on the tunnelled extension to {{LUL stations|station=Bank}}.<ref name=DLRbook/> Because of this, and because adaptation to a new signalling system was too costly, these cars were sold in 1991 to Essener Verkehrs-AG of [[Essen]], Germany, where they were extensively rebuilt and put into service on the [[Essen Stadtbahn]] between 1994 and 1998.<ref>\"Docklands cars sold\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1090 February 1992 page 75</ref><ref name=\"DLR Specs\"/> Originally, they retained DLR colours and were limited to route U11, but after a further modification programme started in 2005 trains are appearing in a yellow livery and are used on all routes.\n\n[[File:EVAG P89 5226 Margarethenhoehe.jpg|thumb|left|P89 stock running in [[Essen]], Germany]]\nIn 1989\u20131990, [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]'s [[Holgate Road carriage works]], supplied another ten numbered 12 to 21. These shared the characteristics of the original P86 stock. They were, though, equipped with sufficient fire-proofing to operate through the tunnels of the Bank extension. These were designated '''P89 stock''' and remained in operation on the DLR until 1995, along with the P86s. The two initial car types were effectively identical in appearance; apart from the car numbers one difference was the red livery underneath the end window was noticeably more orange and reflective on the P89 cars than on the original P86 ones. By 1994, all P89s were modified with single-leaf sliding doors. They were also sold to Essen, where they entered service between 1999 and 2004 after major modifications had been carried out. In 2005 the last cars were repainted in Essen colours. As the Essen Stadtbahn does not use fully automated driving and uses [[overhead line]] rather than [[third rail]] power collection, the modifications to both sets of cars involved fitting driver's cabs and [[Pantograph (rail)|pantographs]]. Today, the former London trains operate all (U11, U17 and U18) lines.\n\n==B90/B92/B2K rolling stock==\n[[File:Royal Victoria DLR station MMB 04 DLR 02.jpg|thumb|Repainted B2K stock arrives at Royal Victoria station.]]\n[[File:Docklands Light Railway train 49 (interior).jpg|thumb|upright|The interior of B92 stock train 49.]]\nFurther vehicles were required as the network grew and as the original P86 and P89 cars had to be replaced due to their unsuitability for the changed system conditions. [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] built 23 vehicles of '''B90 stock''' in 1991, 47 vehicles of '''B92 stock''' between 1993 and 1995, and 24 vehicles of '''B2K stock''' in 2001 and 2002 at its [[Brugge]], Belgium plant. When new the B2K stock differed from the earlier vehicles in appearance as the doors and handrails were painted in colours contrasting to their surroundings and they added front doors to comply with the new safety regulations. They are also fitted with internal [[LCD]] display screens. These differences were all mandated by the [[Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations]] of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act]], which were not in force when the older cars were built.\n\nThe 'B' in the type codes refers to [[Docklands Light Railway#Depots|Beckton DLR depot]], where they are primarily maintained. They are of a common design and can be operated interchangeably in trains of up to three sets.\n\nThe DLR fleet at the end of 2004 consisted of:\n*22\u201344: Bombardier B90, built 1991\n*45\u201391: Bombardier B92, built 1993\u20131995\n*92\u201399, 01\u201316: Bombardier B2K, built 2001\u20132002\n\nThe numbering of the last B2K cars restarted at 01, reusing the numbers of the replaced, original cars. The main reason for this was that the DLR computer system had only been designed originally to handle 2-digit car numbers, and an upgrade to allow 3-digit car numbers did not take place until some time after these cars were received.\n\nDLR cars had a common livery of blue, red, and white upon delivery. Over the years, several vehicles have received all-over advertising livery. A new livery of turquoise and blue was tested on B92 car 40 in the mid-1990s, but it was not adopted, and the car was repainted in standard livery a few years later. The B90, B92 and B2K stocks were refurbished starting in 2004 with the completed trains re-entering service with a redesigned interior and in a new livery of red and blue with grey doors to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act. The refurbished units feature an Audio and Visual Information System which gives audio announcements when approaching a station: \"This train is for ''destination'', the next stop is ''next stop''\", for example:\n\"This train is for Bank, the next stop is Canary Wharf\". It also announces the name of the station when the doors have opened, for example: \"This is Canary Wharf\".<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3615.aspx|title=New accessibility boost for DLR passengers |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|date=2006-05-26|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref> The fronts of the trains were refreshed from 2013, with the red front being repainted into a black front similar to the style of the B07 stock, after an online vote found it to be the most popular.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Have Your Say - Vote for front of train colours|url = http://www.dlrlondon.co.uk/HaveYourSay/vehiclepoll.aspx|website = www.dlrlondon.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-13|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030129/http://www.dlrlondon.co.uk/HaveYourSay/vehiclepoll.aspx|archivedate = 17 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==B07/B09 rolling stock==\n[[File:DLR unit 109 at Heron Quays.JPG|thumb|left|B2007 stock train at [[Heron Quays DLR station]].]]\nIn May 2005, a further 24 vehicles of a new design were ordered from Bombardier for network extensions and three-car service on the Bank\u2013Lewisham route.<ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/dlr-capacity-expansion.html DLR capacity expansion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505204841/http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/dlr-capacity-expansion.html |date=5 May 2018 }} ''Metro Report International'' 1 June 2005</ref> They were to be delivered between May 2007 and September 2008, but were delayed.<ref name=\"TheRailwayCentre.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20March%202008/140308_DLR.html|title=New Docklands Light Railway stock unveiled|publisher=TheRailwayCentre.com|date=March 2008|accessdate=2008-03-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108160743/http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20March%202008/140308_DLR.html|archivedate=8 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"newstock\">{{cite press release |url=http://bombardier.com/en/corporate/media-centre/press-releases/details?docID=0901260d8000fc2d |title=Bombardier Receives A $94 Million US Order From Docklands Light Railway For Automatic Light Rail Cars To Be Used In London, UK |publisher=[[Bombardier Transportation]] |date=4 May 2005 |accessdate=2009-08-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135659/http://bombardier.com/en/corporate/media-centre/press-releases/details?docID=0901260d8000fc2d |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These vehicles are known as 'B07 stock', and are numbered 101 to 124.

However, a disadvantage of this technology is that they are partly responsible for violent shaking as the train travels at higher speeds on the straight parts of the route ([[Hunting oscillation]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAnother manifestation of the DLR's wheel geometry and tight rail curves is that this setup makes noise which is amplified by the use of steel box torsion girders (e.g. Marsh Wall elevated road crossing adjacent to South Quay DLR Station).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Future stock==\nIn 2017, [[Transport For London]] (TfL) published a notice in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] seeking expressions of interest from manufacturers to build a new fleet of 43, {{Convert|87|m|ftin|frac=8|-long|adj=mid}} trains. 33 will replace the 70 B90/92s, while the remaining 10 will support capacity increases in the [[Royal Docks]] area.<ref>\"TfL considers new Docklands fleet\" ''The Railway Magazine'' issue 1393 April 2017 page 84</ref> DLR services presently operate with two or three trains coupled together, but the new fleet will be fixed formation units with [[Gangway connection#Open gangways in urban transit|walk-through]] carriages equivalent to the length of three current trains.

TfL is also seeking improved reliability, and is aiming for a mean distance of {{Convert|50,000|km||abbr=on|sigfig=2}} between service-affecting failures.\n\nThe depot at Beckton is to be expanded to accommodate the new fleet. Procurement is planned through a manufacture and supply agreement, with the DLR franchisee responsible for maintenance and a separate fleet support agreement seeing the manufacturer offer technical support and supply spares. The trains will be financed by a lease, whereby each train would be paid for by the lessor and purchased by TfL at a later date when it can make funds available.<ref>\"Procurement Begins for New DLR Fleet\" ''[[Modern Railways]]'' issue 826 July 2017 page 18</ref> [[Alstom]], Bombardier, [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] and a [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] / [[Stadler Rail]] consortium were shortlisted.<ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/four-shortlisted-for-dockland-light-railway-train-order.html Four shortlisted for Docklands Light Rail train order] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505204752/http://www.metro-report.com/news/metro/single-view/view/four-shortlisted-for-dockland-light-railway-train-order.html |date=5 May 2018 }} ''Metro Report International'' 17 November 2017</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 2019, [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] was announced as the winner to construct 43 units. 33 will replace the existing trains, and a further 10 will serve as additional capacity.

Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had bumper covers molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models in 95 & 96 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta, however paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more traditional colors.\n\nThe Australian market Chrysler Neon came in two models, the SE and the better-equipped LX.

Europe received one limited edition model, the CS, which came only in Platinum paint. It was fitted with the {{convert|131|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} SOHC engine, American R/T specification suspension (slightly lower, {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} rear, {{convert|2.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} front), rear spoiler, unique alloy wheels, standard leather interior, dual stainless steel exhaust, 6CD changer and a shorter 5-speed manual gearbox.\n\n===Trim levels===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1997 Chrysler Neon LX Automatic 2.0 Front.jpg\n| image2 = 1997 Chrysler Neon LX Automatic 2.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = 1997 Chrysler Neon LX saloon (UK)\n}}\n'''Plymouth Neon: 1994\u20131999'''\n*base - 1994-1995 - Standard features included thirteen-inch (13\") steel wheels with wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with 4 speakers, dual front SRS airbags, 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine,  five-speed manual transmission.\n*''Highline'' - 1994\u20131999- Added to '''Base''' air conditioning, side molding, daytime lights, remote trunk release, painted bumper.\n*''Sport'' - 1994\u20131996- Added to '''Highline''' color-keyed wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with cassette player with equalizer and CD changer controls and 6 speakers.\n*''Expresso'' - 1995\u20131999- Added to '''Highline''' power front windows an AM/FM stereo with cassette player.\n*''EX'' - 1997\u20131999\n*''ACR'' - 1994\u20131999- Stood for '''American Club Racer''', added alloy wheels to '''Base'''. \n*''Style'' - 1997\u20131999\n\n'''Dodge Neon: 1994\u20131999'''\n*base - 1994-1995- Standard features included thirteen-inch (13\") steel wheels with wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with 4 speakers, dual front SRS airbags, 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine,  five-speed manual transmission.\n*''Highline'' - 1994\u20131999- Added to '''Base''' air conditioning. \n*''Sport'' - 1994\u20131999- Added to '''Highline''' color-keyed wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with cassette player with equalizer and CD changer controls and 6 speakers.\n*''EX''- 1997\u20131999\n*''ACR'' - 1994\u20131999- Stood for '''American Club Racer''', added alloy wheels to '''Base'''. \n*''R/T'' - 1997\u20131999- Added to '''Highline''' white hood and trunk \"Rally\" stripes, white-painted alloy wheels, AM/FM stereo with cassette player with equalizer and CD changer controls and 6 speakers, and rear spoiler.\n\n'''Chrysler Neon (Canada): 1999\u20132002'''\n*''LE'' - 2000\u20132002 (entry level trim)\n*''LX'' - 2000-2002\n*''R/T'' \u2013 2001-2002 (manual transmission only)\n\n'''Chrysler Neon (Europe): 1994\u20131999'''\n*''LE'' - 1994\u20131999\n*''LX'' - 1994\u20131999\n*''SLX'' - June 1997 \u2013 1999\n*''GLX'' - October 1997 \u2013 1999\n*''CS'' - February 1998 \u2013 1999\n\n===Special models===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\n{{originalresearch-section|date=November 2011}}\n\n====ACR====\nThe ACR Neon, available with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995\u20131996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997\u20131999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter .81 fifth gear and final drive ratio of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to {{convert|130|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights and a lack of side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name \"ACR\" was initially the internal ordering code for the \"Competition Package\", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The [[backronym]] \"American Club Racer\" was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.\n\n====R/T====\nThe R/T model (Road/Track) debuted in the 1998 model year. Offered only with a 5-speed DOHC configuration, the R/T featured many of the ACR's mechanical upgrades including the numerically higher ratio 3.94 5-speed manual transmission, with the .81 5th gear and 130&nbsp;mph speed limit. The R/T, however, was intended for the street, with more comfort and convenience features standard or available, and specialized parts like the adjustable dampers removed, although the dampers as well as the front coil springs found on R/T models were slightly stiffer, offering an advantage over standard model Neons. R/Ts featured optional stripes over the top of the car, silver \"R/T\" badging on the front door panels and the right side of the trunk deck lid, and a functional wing. The \"Stripe Delete\" option was available from the factory, but with no credit to the Neon's price. All striped R/Ts (black, red, blue) had silver colored stripes, with the exception of the White R/Ts, which came with dark blue colored stripes. The R/T also came in 4-door form with limited numbers made.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second Generation (2000\u20132006)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Second generation\n|image = 2nd Plymouth Neon -- 05-22-2010.jpg\n|caption = Plymouth Neon (second generation)\n|production = 1999\u20132005\n|engine = {{ubl | 1.6 L ''[[Tritec engine#1.6(T16b3)|EJD]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline) | 2.0 L ''[[Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engine#A588|A588]]'' I4 (gasoline) | 2.4L ''[[Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDV/EDT]]'' Turbo I4 (gasoline) }}\n|transmission = {{ubl | 5-speed ''[[New Venture Gear|NVG]] T-350'' manual | 3-speed ''[[TorqueFlite#A413 or 31TH|TorqueFlite 31TH]]'' automatic | 4-speed ''[[Ultradrive#40TE|Ultradrive 40TE]]'' automatic | 4-speed ''[[Ultradrive#A604/41TE|Ultradrive 41TE]]'' automatic }}\n|class = Compact sedan\n|body_style = 4-door sedan\n|width = {{convert|67.4|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|wheelbase = {{convert|105.0|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|174.4|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|56.0|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Dodge SRT-4]]\n|aka = {{ubl | Chrysler Neon | Dodge Neon | Plymouth Neon (1999\u20132001) | Dodge SX 2.0 }}\n|designer = Robert McMahan; Robert Boniface (1996)\n}}\n\nSales of the second generation model started with model year 2000 and production ended with the 2005 model year. The second generation Neon was only available as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. In some global sales regions, including the U.S., the sole engine was the 2.0&nbsp;L SOHC engine, the power output remaining at {{convert|132|hp|abbr=on}}. An optional Magnum engine configuration (with an active intake manifold, and other engine revisions to increase power) that produced {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was available. Both engines had a redline of 6762&nbsp;rpm.\n\n[[File:Dodge Neon 2.0i LX 2003 (14268138518).jpg|thumb|Chrysler Neon]]\n\nThe second generation was more refined than the first generation car. It was advertised that the second generation Neon had over 1,000 refinements from the original generation. The first generation's frameless windows were replaced with a full-framed door. Other [[Noise, Vibration, and Harshness|NVH]] refinements were implemented. The new interior and greater size increased weight. The [[DOHC]] engine (Chrysler code name ECC) was no longer available.\n\nIn 2000, the R/T trim returned after a one-year hiatus. The R/T consisted of a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} SOHC Magnum 2.0&nbsp;L Engine, {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels, spoiler, dual chrome exhaust tips, quicker steering box and stiffer springs. The 2001 and 2002 R/Ts had a flat, 'hammerhead' spoiler. From 2000\u20132003, the R/T was sold as a Chrysler in the United Kingdom. The Neon was offered with a sport package for the 2001 model year only commemorating Dodge's return to the NASCAR scene, called the Motorsports Edition. It was available on SE, ES, and R/T and on SE/ES models, consisted of an R/T wing, R/T {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels, R/T springs, Goodyear NASCAR raised yellow-lettering tires, 'Dodge Motorsports' side decals, white instrument cluster and R/T steering box. SE and ES cars were an R/T visually except for the lack of dual exhaust, R/T lower mouldings, fog lamps and R/T exclusive front bumper. The SE and ES only came equipped with the base model's {{convert|132|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine and was available with an automatic transmission (unlike the manual-only R/T model), the R/T retained the 150hp Magnum engine. In 2001, there was also a Sport Appearance Package available on SE and ES, which added the R/T wing and 16\u201d wheels as well as other option availability. 2001 was the last year for the Plymouth Neon, and the Plymouth brand as well. The last Plymouth Neon, which was also the last Plymouth ever produced (a silver four-door sedan), rolled off the assembly line on June 28, 2001.\n\nThe former Dodge and Plymouth Neon were briefly sold under the Chrysler name in Canada from 1999\u20132002, until being renamed as Dodge SX 2.0 for 2003. As before, in Europe, Australia, Mexico, Asia and South America, it continued to be sold as a Chrysler, as Dodge and Plymouth passenger cars were not marketed outside the U.S. and Canada at the time. Besides the 2.0&nbsp;L engine, it used the same [[Tritec engine|Tritec]] 1.6&nbsp;L unit found in the [[Mini (marque)|MINI]] prior to 2007. The 1.6&nbsp;L unit is a variation of the 2.0&nbsp;L SOHC engine designed by Chrysler and built by Tritec.<ref name=\"allpar\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/rover.html  |title=The Chrysler/Mini (Rover) 1.4 and 1.6 Engines |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2015-05-15}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the second generation Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002 model year, and the 03-05 received an updated 40TE four-speed auto, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.\n\n[[File:03-05 Dodge Neon.jpg|thumb|2003\u20132005 Dodge Neon (US)]]\n\nThe Chrysler Neon was renamed '''Dodge SX 2.0''' in Canada for 2003, and sold at Dodge dealerships.. In Australia and Canada, the Chrysler Neon was discontinued in 2002.\nIn 2002, the front clip was changed to match the '''R/T''' and '''ACR''' front clip with the exception of missing a lower lip.\n\nThe Neon was facelifted once again for 2003 with large \"crosseyed\" headlights and crosshair grille to make it look more like a [[Dodge Caravan]] and [[Dodge Stratus]].\n\nThe ACR model was discontinued for 2003; the R/T model for 2004. The Chrysler Neon continued to be sold in Europe until 2004.\n\nIn Brazil, the Neon was marketed as a [[luxury car|luxury]] [[mid-size]] sedan; for [[Mexico]] it was a competitor to the [[Ford Escort (North American)|Ford Escort]], and sold as a Chrysler with either the 1.6 or 2.0&nbsp;L engine and European-style [[taillight]]s (with separate amber indicator lights), except for the R/T model, which was a Dodge, with U.S.-style taillights.\n\nFor the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] market, the Neon proved more successful than for the rest of [[the Continent]]. Trim levels were 2.0 LX and 2.0 SE. However, some grey import versions came in from [[Mexico]].\n\nThis generation continued to be offered in Japan from 1999\u20132001. The Japanese version was installed with leather interior, and was marketed as a small luxury car to Japanese consumers. In 2002, the Neon was replaced by the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] in Japan.\n\n===Trim levels===\n'''Dodge Neon: 2000\u20132005'''\n*''Highline'' - 2000\u20132001- Included 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, 5-speed manual transmission, A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and 4 speakers, fourteen-inch (14\") steel wheels with wheel covers, manual windows, manual door locks, manual air conditioning, and antilock braking system (ABS).\n*''ES'' - 2000\u20132002- Added fifteen-inch (15\") alloy wheels, power door locks, and power front windows to '''Highline'''.\n*''SE'' - 2001\u20132005- Basically same features as '''Highline'''.\n*''R/T'' - 2001\u20132004- Added color-keyed exterior features and rear spoiler to '''ES'''.\n*''Motorsports Edition'' - 2001\n*ACR - 2001-2002- Stood for '''American Club Racer'''.\n*base - 2002\n[[File:Chrysler Neon Dash.jpg|thumb|right|European Chrysler Neon 2000 LE dashboard]]\n*''S'' - 2002\n*''SXT'' - 2002\u20132005- Added fifteen-inch (15\") alloy wheels, A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player and 6 speakers, rear spoiler, power front windows, keyless entry, and power door locks to '''SE'''.\n*[[Srt-4|SRT-4]] - 2003\u20132005- A turbocharged and intercooled 2.4 liter inline-4 gasoline engine (A853 engine) was used,  2.25\" exhaust with 2 resonators, no muffler, and dual 3.75\" stainless steel tips, suspension upgrades (stiffer springs & struts, ACR came with adjustable Tokico Illumina struts), larger brakes, 17x6 alloy wheels (16x7 for ACR), and high-profile rear wing spoiler.\n\n'''Plymouth Neon: 2000\u20132001'''\n*''Highline'' - 2000\u20132001- Included 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, 5-speed manual transmission, A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and 4 speakers, fourteen-inch (14\") steel wheels with wheel covers, manual windows, manual door locks, manual air conditioning, and antilock braking system (ABS).\n*''LX'' - 2000\u20132001\n\n'''Chrysler Neon: 2000\u20132004 (Europe)'''\n*''R/T'' - 2000\u20132003\n*''LX'' - 2000\u20132004\n*''SE'' - 2000\u20132003\n\n'''Chrysler Neon: 2000\u20132002 (Canada)'''\n*''LE'' - 2001 Limited Edition\n*''SE'' - 2000\u20132002\n\n===Final year===\nDaimlerChrysler discontinued the Neon, with the final cars assembled on September 23, 2005 at the [[Belvidere Assembly]] plant in [[Belvidere, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dodge Neon History|url=http://www.dodge-neon.net/history/|website=dodge-neon.net}}</ref> The Neon was replaced in the spring of 2006 with the 2007 [[Dodge Caliber]], which is based on the shared [[Chrysler]]/[[Mitsubishi Motors]] [[Mitsubishi GS platform|GS platform]].

Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had bumper covers molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models in 95 & 96 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta, however paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more traditional colors.\n\nThe Australian market Chrysler Neon came in two models, the SE and the better-equipped LX. Later, the LX model was replaced by the LE with the updated model in 1999.\n\nIn Japan, only the sedan was offered.<ref>[https://www.carsensor.net/catalog/chrysler/neon/F001/ carsensor.net] (Japanese)</ref> It was very similar to those sold in the Australian market. it was equipped with amber turn signal indicators next to the tail lights to comply with Japanese regulations, and a side indicator behind the front wheel installed in the fender.\n\nIn the United States, the lineup started out as Base, Highline, and Sport, with different styles and options in each line, but the lineup titles changed frequently (other trim lines included Expresso, SE, ES, SXT, ACR, and R/T).\n\nIn Europe, the car was available with a 1.8&nbsp;L engine. Europe received one limited edition model, the CS, which came only in Platinum paint. It was fitted with the {{convert|131|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} SOHC engine, American R/T specification suspension (slightly lower, {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} rear, {{convert|2.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} front), rear spoiler, unique alloy wheels, standard leather interior, dual stainless steel exhaust, 6CD changer and a shorter 5-speed manual gearbox.\n\n===Trim levels===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1997 Chrysler Neon LX Automatic 2.0 Front.jpg\n| image2 = 1997 Chrysler Neon LX Automatic 2.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = 1997 Chrysler Neon LX saloon (UK)\n}}\n'''Plymouth Neon: 1994\u20131999'''\n*base - 1994-1995 - Standard features included thirteen-inch (13\") steel wheels with wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with 4 speakers, dual front SRS airbags, 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine,  five-speed manual transmission.\n*''Highline'' - 1994\u20131999- Added to '''Base''' air conditioning, side molding, daytime lights, remote trunk release, painted bumper.\n*''Sport'' - 1994\u20131996- Added to '''Highline''' color-keyed wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with cassette player with equalizer and CD changer controls and 6 speakers.\n*''Expresso'' - 1995\u20131999- Added to '''Highline''' power front windows an AM/FM stereo with cassette player.\n*''EX'' - 1997\u20131999\n*''ACR'' - 1994\u20131999- Stood for '''American Club Racer''', added alloy wheels to '''Base'''. \n*''Style'' - 1997\u20131999\n\n'''Dodge Neon: 1994\u20131999'''\n*base - 1994-1995- Standard features included thirteen-inch (13\") steel wheels with wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with 4 speakers, dual front SRS airbags, 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine,  five-speed manual transmission.\n*''Highline'' - 1994\u20131999- Added to '''Base''' air conditioning. \n*''Sport'' - 1994\u20131999- Added to '''Highline''' color-keyed wheel covers, AM/FM stereo with cassette player with equalizer and CD changer controls and 6 speakers.\n*''EX''- 1997\u20131999\n*''ACR'' - 1994\u20131999- Stood for '''American Club Racer''', added alloy wheels to '''Base'''. \n*''R/T'' - 1997\u20131999- Added to '''Highline''' white hood and trunk \"Rally\" stripes, white-painted alloy wheels, AM/FM stereo with cassette player with equalizer and CD changer controls and 6 speakers, and rear spoiler.\n\n'''Chrysler Neon (Canada): 1999\u20132002'''\n*''LE'' - 2000\u20132002 (entry level trim)\n*''LX'' - 2000-2002\n*''R/T'' \u2013 2001-2002 (manual transmission only)\n\n'''Chrysler Neon (Europe): 1994\u20131999'''\n*''LE'' - 1994\u20131999\n*''LX'' - 1994\u20131999\n*''SLX'' - June 1997 \u2013 1999\n*''GLX'' - October 1997 \u2013 1999\n*''CS'' - February 1998 \u2013 1999\n\n===Special models===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\n{{originalresearch-section|date=November 2011}}\n\n====ACR====\nThe ACR Neon, available with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995\u20131996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997\u20131999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter .81 fifth gear and final drive ratio of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to {{convert|130|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights and a lack of side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name \"ACR\" was initially the internal ordering code for the \"Competition Package\", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The [[backronym]] \"American Club Racer\" was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.\n\n====R/T====\nThe R/T model (Road/Track) debuted in the 1998 model year. Offered only with a 5-speed DOHC configuration, the R/T featured many of the ACR's mechanical upgrades including the numerically higher ratio 3.94 5-speed manual transmission, with the .81 5th gear and 130&nbsp;mph speed limit. The R/T, however, was intended for the street, with more comfort and convenience features standard or available, and specialized parts like the adjustable dampers removed, although the dampers as well as the front coil springs found on R/T models were slightly stiffer, offering an advantage over standard model Neons. R/Ts featured optional stripes over the top of the car, silver \"R/T\" badging on the front door panels and the right side of the trunk deck lid, and a functional wing. The \"Stripe Delete\" option was available from the factory, but with no credit to the Neon's price. All striped R/Ts (black, red, blue) had silver colored stripes, with the exception of the White R/Ts, which came with dark blue colored stripes. The R/T also came in 4-door form with limited numbers made.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second Generation (2000\u20132006)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Second generation\n|image = 2nd Plymouth Neon -- 05-22-2010.jpg\n|caption = Plymouth Neon (second generation)\n|production = 1999\u20132005\n|engine = {{ubl | 1.6 L ''[[Tritec engine#1.6(T16b3)|EJD]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline) | 2.0 L ''[[Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engine#A588|A588]]'' I4 (gasoline) | 2.4L ''[[Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDV/EDT]]'' Turbo I4 (gasoline) }}\n|transmission = {{ubl | 5-speed ''[[New Venture Gear|NVG]] T-350'' manual | 3-speed ''[[TorqueFlite#A413 or 31TH|TorqueFlite 31TH]]'' automatic | 4-speed ''[[Ultradrive#40TE|Ultradrive 40TE]]'' automatic | 4-speed ''[[Ultradrive#A604/41TE|Ultradrive 41TE]]'' automatic }}\n|class = Compact sedan\n|body_style = 4-door sedan\n|width = {{convert|67.4|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|wheelbase = {{convert|105.0|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|174.4|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|56.0|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Dodge SRT-4]]\n|aka = {{ubl | Chrysler Neon | Dodge Neon | Plymouth Neon (1999\u20132001) | Dodge SX 2.0 }}\n|designer = Robert McMahan; Robert Boniface (1996)\n}}\n\nSales of the second generation model started with model year 2000 and production ended with the 2005 model year.

An optional Magnum engine configuration (with an active intake manifold, and other engine revisions to increase power) that produced {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was available. Both engines had a redline of 6762&nbsp;rpm.\n\n[[File:Dodge Neon 2.0i LX 2003 (14268138518).jpg|thumb|Chrysler Neon]]\n\nThe second generation was more refined than the first generation car. It was advertised that the second generation Neon had over 1,000 refinements from the original generation. The first generation's frameless windows were replaced with a full-framed door. Other [[Noise, Vibration, and Harshness|NVH]] refinements were implemented. The new interior and greater size increased weight. The [[DOHC]] engine (Chrysler code name ECC) was no longer available.\n\nIn 2000, the R/T trim returned after a one-year hiatus. The R/T consisted of a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} SOHC Magnum 2.0&nbsp;L Engine, {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels, spoiler, dual chrome exhaust tips, quicker steering box and stiffer springs. The 2001 and 2002 R/Ts had a flat, 'hammerhead' spoiler. From 2000-2003, the R/T was sold as a Chrysler in the United Kingdom. The Neon was offered with a sport package for the 2001 model year only commemorating Dodge's return to the NASCAR scene, called the Motorsports Edition. It was available on SE, ES, and R/T and on SE/ES models, consisted of an R/T wing, R/T {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels, R/T springs, Goodyear NASCAR raised yellow-lettering tires, 'Dodge Motorsports' side decals, white instrument cluster and R/T steering box. SE and ES cars were an R/T visually except for the lack of dual exhaust, R/T lower mouldings, fog lamps and R/T exclusive front bumper. The SE and ES only came equipped with the base model's {{convert|132|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine and was available with an automatic transmission (unlike the manual-only R/T model), the R/T retained the 150hp Magnum engine. In 2001, there was also a Sport Appearance Package available on SE and ES, which added the R/T wing and 16\u201d wheels as well as other option availability. 2001 was the last year for the Plymouth Neon, and the Plymouth brand as well. The last Plymouth Neon, which was also the last Plymouth ever produced (a silver four-door sedan), rolled off the assembly line on June 28, 2001.\n\nThe former Dodge and Plymouth Neon were briefly sold under the Chrysler name in Canada from 1999\u20132002, until being renamed as Dodge SX 2.0 for 2003. As before, in Europe, Australia, Mexico, Asia and South America, it continued to be sold as a Chrysler, as Dodge and Plymouth passenger cars were not marketed outside the U.S. and Canada at the time. Besides the 2.0&nbsp;L engine, it used the same [[Tritec engine|Tritec]] 1.6&nbsp;L unit found in the [[Mini (marque)|MINI]] prior to 2007. The 1.6&nbsp;L unit is a variation of the 2.0&nbsp;L SOHC engine designed by Chrysler and built by Tritec.<ref name=\"allpar\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/rover.html  |title=The Chrysler/Mini (Rover) 1.4 and 1.6 Engines |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2015-05-15}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the second generation Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002 model year, and the 03-05 received an updated 40TE four-speed auto, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.\n\n[[File:03-05 Dodge Neon.jpg|thumb|2003\u20132005 Dodge Neon (US)]]\n\nThe Chrysler Neon was renamed '''Dodge SX 2.0''' in Canada for 2003, and sold at Dodge dealerships.. In Australia and Canada, the Chrysler Neon was discontinued in 2002.\nIn 2002, the front clip was changed to match the '''R/T''' and '''ACR''' front clip with the exception of missing a lower lip.\n\nThe Neon was facelifted once again for 2003 with large \"crosseyed\" headlights and crosshair grille to make it look more like a [[Dodge Caravan]] and [[Dodge Stratus]].\n\nThe ACR model was discontinued for 2003; the R/T model for 2004. The Chrysler Neon continued to be sold in Europe until 2004.\n\nIn Brazil, the Neon was marketed as a [[luxury car|luxury]] [[mid-size]] sedan; for [[Mexico]] it was a competitor to the [[Ford Escort (North American)|Ford Escort]], and sold as a Chrysler with either the 1.6 or 2.0&nbsp;L engine and European-style [[taillight]]s (with separate amber indicator lights), except for the R/T model, which was a Dodge, with U.S.-style taillights.\n\nFor the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] market, the Neon proved more successful than for the rest of [[the Continent]]. Trim levels were 2.0 LX and 2.0 SE. However, some grey import versions came in from [[Mexico]].\n\nThis generation continued to be offered in Japan from 1999-2001. The Japanese version was installed with leather interior, and was marketed as a small luxury car to Japanese consumers. In 2002, the Neon was replaced by the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] in Japan.\n\n===Trim levels===\n'''Dodge Neon: 2000\u20132005'''\n*''Highline'' - 2000\u20132001- Included 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, 5-speed manual transmission, A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and 4 speakers, fourteen-inch (14\") steel wheels with wheel covers, manual windows, manual door locks, manual air conditioning, and antilock braking system (ABS).\n*''ES'' - 2000\u20132002- Added fifteen-inch (15\") alloy wheels, power door locks, and power front windows to '''Highline'''.\n*''SE'' - 2001\u20132005- Basically same features as '''Highline'''.\n*''R/T'' - 2001\u20132004- Added color-keyed exterior features and rear spoiler to '''ES'''.\n*''Motorsports Edition'' - 2001\n*ACR - 2001-2002- Stood for '''American Club Racer'''.\n*base - 2002\n[[File:Chrysler Neon Dash.jpg|thumb|right|European Chrysler Neon 2000 LE dashboard]]\n*''S'' - 2002\n*''SXT'' - 2002\u20132005- Added fifteen-inch (15\") alloy wheels, A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player and 6 speakers, rear spoiler, power front windows, keyless entry, and power door locks to '''SE'''.\n*[[Srt-4|SRT-4]] - 2003\u20132005- A turbocharged and intercooled 2.4 liter inline-4 gasoline engine (A853 engine) was used,  2.25\" exhaust with 2 resonators, no muffler, and dual 3.75\" stainless steel tips, suspension upgrades (stiffer springs & struts, ACR came with adjustable Tokico Illumina struts), larger brakes, 17x6 alloy wheels (16x7 for ACR), and high-profile rear wing spoiler.\n\n'''Plymouth Neon: 2000\u20132001'''\n*''Highline'' - 2000\u20132001- Included 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, 5-speed manual transmission, A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and 4 speakers, fourteen-inch (14\") steel wheels with wheel covers, manual windows, manual door locks, manual air conditioning, and antilock braking system (ABS).\n*''LX'' - 2000\u20132001\n\n'''Chrysler Neon: 2000\u20132004 (Europe)'''\n*''R/T'' - 2000\u20132003\n*''LX'' - 2000\u20132004\n*''SE'' - 2000\u20132003\n\n'''Chrysler Neon: 2000\u20132002 (Canada)'''\n*''LE'' - 2001 Limited Edition\n*''SE'' - 2000\u20132002\n\n===Final year===\nDaimlerChrysler discontinued the Neon, with the final cars assembled on September 23, 2005 at the [[Belvidere Assembly]] plant in [[Belvidere, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dodge Neon History|url=http://www.dodge-neon.net/history/|website=dodge-neon.net}}</ref> The Neon was replaced in the spring of 2006 with the 2007 [[Dodge Caliber]], which is based on the shared [[Chrysler]]/[[Mitsubishi Motors]] [[Mitsubishi GS platform|GS platform]].

It is the fourth entry in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series and an indirect sequel to ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena]]''. In North America, ''Armored Core 2'' was a launch title for the PlayStation 2. A direct sequel, ''[[Armored Core 2: Another Age]]'', was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2. \n\nThe story takes place almost 70 years after ''Master of Arena''. Following the colonization of [[Mars]], a powerful organization called the Frighteners overthrows the government at the behest of their leader, the enigmatic Leos Klein. The player is a mercenary who is tasked with dismantling the Frighteners and defeating Klein. \n\n''Armored Core 2''<nowiki/>'s gameplay is largely similar to that of its predecessors. Players take control of powerful machines called Armored Cores and engage in dangerous missions or fight in the Arena against other pilots. Like earlier games, ''Armored Core 2'' features a local multiplayer mode that includes a console linking feature and allows two players to fight each other with their own custom Armored Core.\n== Gameplay ==\n''Armored Core 2'' is a third-person shooter in which players pilot machines called Armored Cores. These Cores can be fully customized with different parts, weapons, and paint schemes to create a unique loadout.<ref name=gamerev/> Players must balance their loadout to ensure that they aren't too heavy or are using too much power. In order to purchase more parts, players must earn credits through missions or the Arena.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gamepro/>\n\nMissions are largely unchanged from the original ''Armored Core''. Players are given an objective to complete in open levels and can complete the objective however they choose. Enemies can consist of automated machines called MTs, mysterious unmanned weapons called Disorders, or other Armored Core pilots. Upon completion, repair and ammunition costs are deducted from the reward payout. If a player fails a mission, those costs are directly deducted from their overall balance.<ref name=ign/>\n\nThe Arena is a largely freeform gamemode that the player can enter at any time. At the start of the game, the player is ranked at the bottom of a 50-person ladder and must fight their way to the top.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gspot/> Some ranked pilots can be killed over the course of the story missions and removed from the ladder. As players win, they can earn credits or parts for their victories that can be used in both the Arena and story missions.<ref name=gspot/>\n\nIn addition to missions and the Arena, a local multiplayer mode allows players to fight their friends via split screen or console linking with a Sony I-link Fire Wire cable.<ref name=gamerev/> While split screen only requires one copy of the game, console linking requires two copies, along with two separate consoles and two televisions. Console linking allows for a larger number of location options in the game mode. Players with existing saves can load their custom Armored Core into these multiplayer matches.<ref name=gamepro/>\n\n==Plot==\n67 years after ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena|Master of Arena]]'', [[Earth|Earth's]] second largest corporation, Zio Matrix, acquires plans for a research project on [[Mars]], dating back before the Great Destruction. Using these plans, Zio Matrix sends a research team to Mars to begin the [[Terraforming]] Project, which causes the Martian surface and atmosphere to approximate that of Earth. Other corporations learn of the project and quickly follow Zio Matrix, bringing with them the competitive environment that existed on Earth, and the employ of the mercenaries of Nerves Concord.\n\nAs the three companies' war comes to a close, Zio Matrix attempts a coup against the government, which has regained control through its elite mercenary team, The Frighteners, led by Leos Klein.

It is the fourth entry in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series and an indirect sequel to ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena]]''. In North America, ''Armored Core 2'' was a launch title for the PlayStation 2. A direct sequel, ''[[Armored Core 2: Another Age]]'', was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2. \n\nThe story takes place almost 70 years after ''Master of Arena''. Following the colonization of [[Mars]], a powerful organization called the Frighteners overthrows the government at the behest of their leader, the enigmatic Leos Klein. The player is a mercenary who is tasked with dismantling the Frighteners and defeating Klein. \n\n''Armored Core 2''<nowiki/>'s gameplay is largely similar to that of its predecessors. Players take control of powerful machines called Armored Cores and engage in dangerous missions or fight in the Arena against other pilots. Like earlier games, ''Armored Core 2'' features a local multiplayer mode that includes a console linking feature and allows two players to fight each other with their own custom Armored Core.\n== Gameplay ==\n''Armored Core 2'' is a third-person shooter in which players pilot machines called Armored Cores. These Cores can be fully customized with different parts, weapons, and paint schemes to create a unique loadout.<ref name=gamerev/> Players must balance their loadout to ensure that they aren't too heavy or are using too much power. In order to purchase more parts, players must earn credits through missions or the Arena.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gamepro/>\n\nMissions are largely unchanged from the original ''Armored Core''. Players are given an objective to complete in open levels and can complete the objective however they choose. Enemies can consist of automated machines called MTs, mysterious unmanned weapons called Disorders, or other Armored Core pilots. Upon completion, repair and ammunition costs are deducted from the reward payout. If a player fails a mission, those costs are directly deducted from their overall balance.<ref name=ign/>\n\nThe Arena is a largely freeform gamemode that the player can enter at any time. At the start of the game, the player is ranked at the bottom of a 50-person ladder and must fight their way to the top.<ref name=allgame/><ref name=gspot/> Some ranked pilots can be killed over the course of the story missions and removed from the ladder. As players win, they can earn credits or parts for their victories that can be used in both the Arena and story missions.<ref name=gspot/>\n\nIn addition to missions and the Arena, a local multiplayer mode allows players to fight their friends via split screen or console linking with a Sony I-link Fire Wire cable.<ref name=gamerev/> While split screen only requires one copy of the game, console linking requires two copies, along with two separate consoles and two televisions. Console linking allows for a larger number of location options in the game mode. Players with existing saves can load their custom Armored Core into these multiplayer matches.<ref name=gamepro/>\n\n==Plot==\n67 years after ''[[Armored Core: Master of Arena|Master of Arena]]'', [[Earth|Earth's]] second largest corporation, Zio Matrix, acquires plans for a research project on [[Mars]], dating back before the Great Destruction. Using these plans, Zio Matrix sends a research team to Mars to begin the [[Terraforming]] Project, which causes the Martian surface and atmosphere to approximate that of Earth. Other corporations learn of the project and quickly follow Zio Matrix, bringing with them the competitive environment that existed on Earth, and the employ of the mercenaries of Nerves Concord.\n\nAs the three companies' war comes to a close, Zio Matrix attempts a coup against the government, which has regained control through its elite mercenary team, The Frighteners, led by Leos Klein. But in the chaos that ensues, the Frighteners turn on the government, assassinate its leader, and take control of powerful technology. The player character is tasked with confronting them and saving the human populace of Mars.\n\n== Release ==\n''Armored Core 2'' was initially released in [[Japan]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] on August 3, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/detail.html?csm=015|title=Armored Core 2 {{!}} FromSoftware|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fromsoftware.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> [[FromSoftware]] partnered with [[Agetec]] and released a [[North America|North American]] version on October 26, 2000 as a launch title for the PlayStation 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/28/the-ps2-launch-titles|title=The PS2 Launch Titles|author=IGN staff|date=October 27, 2000|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref> A [[Europe|European]] version was released in partnership with [[Ubisoft]] on March 23, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/35329/Armored-Core-2/|title=Armored Core 2 -

Written by [[Greg Daniels]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], the episode first aired in the United States on January 5, 2006 on [[NBC]]. The episode featured [[Rob Riggle]] and [[Amy Adams]] as guest stars.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) brings the office on a [[booze cruise]] and plans on doing some [[motivational speaking|\"motivational\" speaking]]. After he learns that the captain of the boat has other plans, a power struggle emerges. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy]]'s ([[David Denman]]) previously stagnant relationship blossoms, while [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and Katy's ([[Amy Adams]]) begins to falter.\n\nThe story for \"Booze Cruise\" was inspired by a friend of [[B. J. Novak]]'s who had gone on a booze cruise. Novak told Daniels about the trip, and Daniels then proceeded to write an episode about it. The episode featured the third and final appearance of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. The filming of the episode was a departure from the norm of the series; filming took place on an actual boat and because of this, many cast members got sea sick. \"Booze Cruise\" received largely positive reviews from critics. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.5 in the 18\u201349 demographic and was viewed by 8.7 million viewers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Dunder Mifflin]] crew goes on a cruise on a [[Lake Wallenpaupack]] ship ''Princess''\u2014in January. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) plans to use the cruise as both a party and a leadership training exercise. However, \"Captain Jack\" ([[Rob Riggle]]) keeps preventing him from giving a business lecture and compromises his metaphor involving himself as \"captain\" of the office.\n\nThe captain puts [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) in charge of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), who has brought his girlfriend [[Katy Moore]] ([[Amy Adams]]) on the cruise, and [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their significant others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, the passengers panic, one of them grabbing a life vest and jumping off the ship. The captain temporarily detains Michael by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.\n\nAfter hearing a war story from the captain, a drunken [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]) is inspired to announce a date for his wedding with Pam. Jim is crushed and breaks up with Katy, realizing that he does not want to be with her. He confesses his feelings for Pam to Michael, who acts surprised and claims Jim hid his feelings well. Michael encourages him to not give up on Pam.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Amy Adams (29708985502) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Amy Adams]] guest starred for the last time in the episode, playing Katy.]] \n\n\"Booze Cruise\" was written by [[Greg Daniels]], making it his fourth writing credit, and his second season two credit, after \"[[Halloween (The Office)|Halloween]]\" earlier in the year.<ref name=\"DVD2\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Office: The Complete First Season |titlelink=The Office (U.S. season 1) |year=2005 |others=[[Ken Kwapis]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref><ref name=\"halloween\">{{cite episode |title=Halloween  |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer); [[Paul Feig]] (director) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 18, 2005 |season=2 |number=5}}</ref> The episode was directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], making it his sixth directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"DVD2\"/><ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Office: The Complete Second Season |titlelink=The Office (American season 2) |year=2005{{ndash}}2006 |others=[[Greg Daniels]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref> [[Greg Daniels]] referred to this episode as \"our [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] version of [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Office A to Z|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Z-10830.aspx|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417220416/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Z-10830.aspx|archivedate=April 17, 2009|date=November 5, 2007}}</ref> The idea came from [[B.

Written by [[Greg Daniels]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], the episode first aired in the United States on January 5, 2006 on [[NBC]]. The episode featured [[Rob Riggle]] and [[Amy Adams]] as guest stars.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) brings the office on a [[booze cruise]] and plans on doing some [[motivational speaking|\"motivational\" speaking]]. After he learns that the captain of the boat has other plans, a power struggle emerges. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy]]'s ([[David Denman]]) previously stagnant relationship blossoms, while [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and Katy's ([[Amy Adams]]) begins to falter.\n\nThe story for \"Booze Cruise\" was inspired by a friend of [[B. J. Novak]]'s who had gone on a booze cruise. Novak told Daniels about the trip, and Daniels then proceeded to write an episode about it. The episode featured the third and final appearance of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. The filming of the episode was a departure from the norm of the series; filming took place on an actual boat and because of this, many cast members got sea sick. \"Booze Cruise\" received largely positive reviews from critics. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.5 in the 18\u201349 demographic and was viewed by 8.7 million viewers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Dunder Mifflin]] crew goes on a cruise on a [[Lake Wallenpaupack]] ship ''Princess''\u2014in January. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) plans to use the cruise as both a party and a leadership training exercise. However, \"Captain Jack\" ([[Rob Riggle]]) keeps preventing him from giving a business lecture and compromises his metaphor involving himself as \"captain\" of the office.\n\nThe captain puts [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) in charge of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), who has brought his girlfriend [[Katy Moore]] ([[Amy Adams]]) on the cruise, and [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their significant others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, the passengers panic, one of them grabbing a life vest and jumping off the ship. The captain temporarily detains Michael by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.\n\nAfter hearing a war story from the captain, a drunken [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]) is inspired to announce a date for his wedding with Pam. Jim is crushed and breaks up with Katy, realizing that he does not want to be with her. He confesses his feelings for Pam to Michael, who acts surprised and claims Jim hid his feelings well. Michael encourages him to not give up on Pam.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Amy Adams (29708985502) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Amy Adams]] guest starred for the last time in the episode, playing Katy.]] \n\n\"Booze Cruise\" was written by [[Greg Daniels]], making it his fourth writing credit, and his second season two credit, after \"[[Halloween (The Office)|Halloween]]\" earlier in the year.<ref name=\"DVD2\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Office: The Complete First Season |titlelink=The Office (U.S. season 1) |year=2005 |others=[[Ken Kwapis]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref><ref name=\"halloween\">{{cite episode |title=Halloween  |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer); [[Paul Feig]] (director) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 18, 2005 |season=2 |number=5}}</ref> The episode was directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], making it his sixth directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"DVD2\"/><ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Office: The Complete Second Season |titlelink=The Office (American season 2) |year=2005{{ndash}}2006 |others=[[Greg Daniels]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref> [[Greg Daniels]] referred to this episode as \"our [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] version of [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Office A to Z|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Z-10830.aspx|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417220416/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Z-10830.aspx|archivedate=April 17, 2009|date=November 5, 2007}}</ref> The idea came from [[B.

In his last game, he scored the only goal in Schalke's 1\u20130 victory against the [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgarian national team]] on 18 June 1963.<ref name=\"Bitter\"/> He played in 330 [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]] games in which he scored 129 goals.<ref name=\"WF\"/>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1959, Klodt played 19 times and scored three goals for the [[Germany national football team]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/klodtbernhard/ | title = Bernhard Klodt | accessdate = 25 January 2010 | language = German | publisher = fussballdaten.de}}</ref> He was part of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]]-winning squad, and also played in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. \n\nDuring the 1954 World Cup, Klodt had started in the [[outside right]] position instead of [[Helmut Rahn]]. He played in both games against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. Although he played fairly well in both games, [[Sepp Herberger]] decided to replace him with Rahn for the quarterfinal against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. Herberger's decision at first was not exclusively greeted with enthusiasm by the press, but after Rahn had scored against Yugoslavia, Klodt was out of the team for good. The basis for Herberger's decision was his hope that Rahn with his unconventional style and shooting prowess was more likely to turn around a game than any other player. Contrary to Rahn, Klodt was said to be less of an individualist and more of a teamplayer.<ref name=\"Bitter\">{{cite book | last = Bitter | first= J\u00fcrgen | title = Deutschlands Fu\u00dfball Nationalspieler| publisher =  Sportverlag | year = 1997 | page = 241f | language = German}}</ref>\n\n==After football==\nAfter his retirement from football, Klodt among other things coached the youth team of FC Schalke 04 and also worked as salesman for a brewery.
