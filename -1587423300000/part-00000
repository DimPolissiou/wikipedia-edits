''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|title=Wrestling, IOC make right moves in getting sport back on 2020 Olympics program|last=Hamilton|first=Tracee|date=8 September 2013|work=Washington Post|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143725/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|title=Olympics Moves to Drop Wrestling in 2020|last=Longman|first=Jer\u00e9|date=12 February 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621150844/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=bbc-nowrestling>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|title=Wrestling to be dropped from 2020 Olympic Games|work=BBC Sport|date=12 February 2013 |access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701064236/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\" />\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: [[baseball]]/[[softball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[wrestling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |title=Baseball/softball, squash and wrestling make cut for IOC Session vote in Buenos Aires |date=29 May 2013 |website=Olympic.org |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607170846/https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |archive-date=7 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The other five sports were rejected at this point: [[karate]], [[roller sport]]s, [[sport climbing]], [[wakeboarding]], and [[wushu (sport)|wushu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|title=Wrestling, baseball/softball and squash shortlisted by IOC for 2020 as five fail to make cut|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124611/http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> On 8&nbsp;September 2013, at the [[125th IOC Session]], wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and [[2024 Summer Olympics|2024]].<!--but as a non-\"core\" sport this time--> Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|title=Wrestling added to Olympic program for 2020 and 2024 Games|publisher=[[IOC]]|date=8 September 2013|access-date=8 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911122207/http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|archive-date=11 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder new IOC policies that shift the Games to use an \"event-based\" program rather than a \"sport-based\" program, the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the program.

''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|title=Wrestling, IOC make right moves in getting sport back on 2020 Olympics program|last=Hamilton|first=Tracee|date=8 September 2013|work=Washington Post|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143725/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|title=Olympics Moves to Drop Wrestling in 2020|last=Longman|first=Jer\u00e9|date=12 February 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621150844/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=bbc-nowrestling>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|title=Wrestling to be dropped from 2020 Olympic Games|work=BBC Sport|date=12 February 2013 |access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701064236/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\" />\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: [[baseball]]/[[softball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[wrestling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |title=Baseball/softball, squash and wrestling make cut for IOC Session vote in Buenos Aires |date=29 May 2013 |website=Olympic.org |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607170846/https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |archive-date=7 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The other five sports were rejected at this point: [[karate]], [[roller sport]]s, [[sport climbing]], [[wakeboarding]], and [[wushu (sport)|wushu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|title=Wrestling, baseball/softball and squash shortlisted by IOC for 2020 as five fail to make cut|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124611/http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> On 8&nbsp;September 2013, at the [[125th IOC Session]], wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and [[2024 Summer Olympics|2024]].<!--but as a non-\"core\" sport this time--> Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|title=Wrestling added to Olympic program for 2020 and 2024 Games|publisher=[[IOC]]|date=8 September 2013|access-date=8 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911122207/http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|archive-date=11 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder new IOC policies that shift the Games to use an \"event-based\" program rather than a \"sport-based\" program, the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the program.

When walking home one night, [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) notices Les being handed money by [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) grandson, [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]). Fatboy tries to tell Dot what Les and Charlie are up to, but is unsuccessful. In July, Les hires [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) at the undertakers, however he is disappointed when Billy doesn't turn up for work on his first day. Pam is upset when Les insults [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) while drunk, fearful it will reveal a big secret they have been keeping; that she euthanised their dying son, Lawrie. Billy eventually establishes a good working relationship with Les and a friendship as they spend Christmas together. Billy discovers the business is deeply in debt and forces Les to tell Pam this. They vow no more secrets, but after Les meets with his 'other woman', [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) and gives her an expensive necklace. Claudette and Pam are revealed to be old friends, as Claudette is a foster mother and Pam used to help children in care. Les holidays in Gran Canaria with Claudette, although Pam sees it as a coincidence when she learns from Claudette's foster daughter [[Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) that they are both there at the same time.\n\nLes arranges a party for the centenary of Coker & Sons, and Pam gets upset at the thought that their grandson, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), will not attend. The same day, Paul returns but is cold towards Les. He reveals he is aware of his long running affair with Claudette and that was why he went to work abroad in the first place, not because of Pam's decision to euthanise his father as they previously believed. Paul threatens to expose the affair to Pam so Les tries to end things with Claudette, but Claudette tells Les that it will not be that easy. Claudette's son [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) then becomes aware of the relationship between her and Les, and Paul tells Pam about it. Pam then finds Les's tie at Claudette's house, and when Les and Claudette give conflicting explanations, Pam leaves to stay with her sister. Les becomes very distraught at her departure, and Claudette urges him to tell Pam the truth, just as Pam returns and walks in on them together. Shortly after Claudette leaves the house, Pam urges Les to end the affair or their marriage is over. Two months later, Les visits Claudette for comfort after Pam refuses to speak to him on Lawrie's birthday. He later calls Claudette, telling her he cannot stop thinking about her, and makes an excuse to Pam to go and be with Claudette again. He is then caught in his underwear in Claudette's house by Donna, who concludes they are having an affair, and despite Les and Claudette denying it, Donna tells Pam what she saw. Pam then goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying gifts from Les until Claudette says the presents are not hers, and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam asks Les, he reveals that Christine is his secret [[Transvestism|feminine alter ego]], where he dresses up in women's clothes and has done so since he was seven years old, but after they married he did not need Christine until Lawrie died, when the alter-ego became a grief outlet for him, and Claudette has been supporting this secret. Pam is horrified at him having lied to, and tells Les he disgusts her. However, Pam agrees to \"meet\" Christine. Les, as Christine, explains that this is how he can cope with things, as Christine is more open than Les, and he is still the same person. Pam apparently begins to accept this, but when Paul interrupts, Pam says she cannot accept it, so packs a bag and leaves, while Paul comforts Les. Paul manages to convince Pam to return home to talk to Les, but when she gets hesitant again, Les moves out to give Pam some time to think, and he moves in with Billy. Pam and Les have dinner together but she still cannot get the image of him dressed as Christine out of her mind, soLes burns all of Christine's clothes and photos and Pam agrees to take things one day at a time, but [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) is watching and finds and pockets a surviving photo of Les dressed as Christine. Shortly after, Paul encourages Les to remind Pam of the man she first fell in love with and she agrees to his moving back in as long as they sleep in separate beds.\n\nA few months later, Les spurns Babe, so she sends Les an anonymous email, blackmailing him over his crossdressing. When Pam notices money has been paid from their account, Les admits he has been blackmailed. The blackmailing continues regularly, and Pam starts to suspect Babe, and eventually they discover the truth. Les confides in Claudette and says he misses Christine, so she gives him some of her clothes and makeup that she still has. Stressed, Les dresses up again but is caught by Paul. Paul refuses to destroy Christine's things for Les, saying Les should not suffer for who he is. When Pam finds Les dressed as Christine, she chastises him and he suffers a heart attack. Billy sees him as he enters the ambulance. Billy calls Les a \"pervert\" to Pam, so she fires him from the funeral parlour. Pam then tells Les they should retire away from London and Les agrees; when Paul and his boyfriend [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) find out, they decide they should take over the running of the funeral parlour. Paul's mother, [[Jenny Rawlinson]], arrives looking for him, but he only assumes she is the blackmailer and orders her away. Pam and Les vow to tell Paul who she is, but Paul is killed in a homophobic attack. Pam struggles to cope, refusing to talk to Les about Paul, so he considers dressing as Christine; he explains why he cross-dresses to Billy and gives him his job back. Les then decides to be strong for Pam so tells Claudette he will no longer be Christine, but the blackmailing continues, with Pam refusing to go to the police, but she tells Claudette that Babe is the blackmailer. After four months of blackmail, Claudette reveals this to Babe's family, and Babe, who has just been attacked by [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) and come close to death, tells Claudette that she now sees how bad she has been and regrets everything, so it will stop. Les and Pam later attend a court hearing for Paul's killers. Les calls one of them, [[Simon Atmore]] ([[Tom Palmer (actor)|Tom Palmer]]), a liar after he denies having anything to do with Paul's death. When they arrive home, Pam tells him he needs to be Christine again. Les later suffers a small heart attack after talking to [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) who tries to comfort him and he eventually dresses up as Christine. Les then asks Pam if she would consider leaving Walford together for a fresh start after the trial is over which she agrees. Les and Pam are delighted when Babe returns all of their money. However, they decide to leave and Les appoints Billy as the manager of Coker and Sons. Pam packs a box of Christine's wig and clothes suggesting she has accepted her. After saying an emotional farewell to his friends and after giving Billy his funeral hat, Les departs with Pam for a new life in [[Worthing]].\n\n=== Development and reception ===\nHaving been originally introduced as the funeral director who arranged [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]]' ([[Pam St. Clement]]) funeral, Sloman appeared in one episode on 9 January 2012 as a guest character.<ref name=\"9jan\"/> He then appeared in five episodes between June and July 2012.<ref name=\"20jun\"/><ref name=\"5jul\"/><ref name=\"10jul\"/><ref name=\"17jul\"/><ref name=\"31jul\"/> Les was reintroduced for one episode on 25 March 2014 when he arranges [[Nick Cotton]]'s ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) funeral.<ref name=\"Les2014\"/> Following this, Sloman was reintroduced as a regular cast member with Les' wife, [[Pam Coker|Pam]] ([[Lin Blakley]]) being introduced also.<ref name=\"LesPam14\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/entries/516c9e6c-c815-3d02-a577-fa34928043d8|title=New funeral parlour opens on Albert Square|date=4 April 2014|website=BBC}}</ref> Executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] said \"Les and Pam are part of our plans to rejuvenate the show's older generation.

Dennis is stabbed and killed in the early hours of New Year's Day 2006, and Sharon moves to Florida, where she gives birth to Dennis Jr. In July 2006, [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) receives the news that Sharon has given birth to her son.\n\nDennis appears in August 2012, on the day of Sharon's wedding, to her partner, [[John Hewland]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]). Sharon discovers that he is missing, and eventually realises that John has kidnapped him. Sharon asks her ex-lover [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), to help rescue Dennis,<ref name=\"13aug2\" /> and he takes the pair back to Walford.<ref name=\"14aug\" /> Dennis starts Walford Primary School, and starts to think of Phil as a father-figure. Dennis is upset when Phil's enemy [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) reveals the truth about his father's murder, as he believed that he was a helicopter pilot, who died saving others. Sharon admits to Dennis that she lied to protect him. The revelation upsets and enrages Dennis, though he later forgives his mother. In 2013, after losing their home at the local bed and breakfast, they move in with Derek's younger brother [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]). Jack teaches Dennis to box, leading to him starting a fight at school.\n\nIn 2014, Sharon is attacked in her bar and as a result, she loses her temper and shakes Dennis who is then frightened and runs away. In early 2015, a fiery clash leads Dennis to leave scratches on his mother's face. When he misbehaves in school, and around Sharon's friends when she is not there, Sharon refuses to believe that Dennis is lying about his behaviour, and blames those that he has upset when Sharon's childhood friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and his wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) inform her over Dennis' misbehaviour.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2015, after overhearing Sharon and Phil during dinner, Dennis (now played by [[Bleu Landau]]) tells his friend and Ian's son [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) that he knows he killed his half-sister, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). When Dennis and Bobby race their bikes, they fight on the Walford Common and Phil and Ian find Dennis. Phil is drunk whilst driving and crashes the car while distracted. Dennis is severely injured and taken to hospital. He has a [[subdural haematoma]] which requires an operation. Ian takes responsibility by saying he was driving, making a deal with Phil. However, Phil confesses that he was the one who drove the car, so when Dennis is discharged from the hospital, Sharon takes him away to stay with her father [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]). Dennis returns a week and a half later with Sharon for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Honey Mitchell]]'s ([[Emma Barton]]) second engagement party only to find Phil on the floor having collapsed from coughing up blood. Sharon reveals to [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) that Gavin hit Dennis during their stay and that is the reason why they left. However, in July 2016, Dennis misses Gavin and has a second mobile phone to which he only contacts Gavin from. Sharon discovers this and is furious, but is later unnerved when Gavin collects Dennis from school, and realises that he could easily abduct Dennis.\n\nIn November 2016, Sharon becomes concerned about Dennis's behaviour and decides to apply to send him to an alternative high school. Dennis takes the stabbing of a school friend, Eddie Kendall, hard and confides in his stepsister [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) that he does not want Phil to die, who has rejected a transplant. Phil overhears this and announces to his family he is going on the transplant list. Sharon decides to let Dennis go to Eddie's funeral. On the day of Eddie's funeral, Dennis is unsure about going, but Phil encourages him so he does not regret it and can say goodbye. Dennis later attends the funeral. In December 2016, Dennis gets a part in the Christmas show, and volunteers to take a part that involves his and Louise's characters kissing, saying he would not mind it, but the part is given to someone else. He is later reprimanded when he gets caught watching Louise and other girls getting changed. Sharon punishes Dennis for this but Phil says he was doing what normal boys do.\n\nWhile Sharon is on holiday with Phil, Sharon's best friend, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]), looks after Dennis and Louise. In March 2017, Dennis sees Michelle and 17-year-old [[Preston Cooper]] (Martin Anzor) kissing so starts blackmailing Michelle into buying him things and letting him stay off school. Michelle is furious when she finds out Dennis bought a video game using her credit card and Dennis brands her a paedophile, resulting in a slap from Michelle. Louise does not witness this but catches Michelle calling Dennis a \"brat\". Dennis demands \u00a3100 from Michelle to keep quiet about her hitting him, but she refuses and he kicks her. When Louise finds him, she tries to get through to him over arguing with Michelle and he reveals that Michelle and Preston are having an affair. The affair is revealed which leads to Michelle crashing Phil's car and Sharon returning and convincing Preston to return to the United States in April 2017. Sharon then tells Dennis and Louise to be nice to Michelle. When Louise has a party with her friends, [[Madison Drake]] and [[Alexandra D'Costa]] ([[Seraphina Beh]] and [[Sydney Craven]]), Dennis turns up and Louise lets him stay on the condition he keeps quiet about them having alcohol. Louise gets drunk after her drink is spiked and is sick, and as she staggers outside, she coughs up blood and collapses, which panics Dennis and those around Louise. In July 2017, Dennis and [[Will Mitchell]] (Freddie Phillips) plan to throw eggs at [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris (actor)|Zack Morris]]), but accidentally hit his half-sister, [[Bernadette Taylor]] (Clair Norris). Keegan gets into Dennis's house and tells them Bernadette is pregnant. Dennis and Will apologise and Keegan attempts to force Dennis to smoke a cigarette, but is caught and thrown out by Michelle. After this, Dennis forgives Michelle for hitting him. In August 2017, Sharon and Phil receive a date for Dennis' adoption hearing. Dennis asks Phil if he wants him to change his surname to Mitchell upon his adoption as he wants to keep his current surname, which Phil does not mind.\n\nIn 2018, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) gets Dennis to steal the keys to The Queen Vic as part of his plan to take revenge on the Carter family. Dennis wants a new phone but Sharon refuses so he buys a stolen phone from [[Jagger Rawley]] (Aaron Thomas Ward), and he then hides a bag of phones in the garage for him, which [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]) finds. Phil sees off Jagger's gang when they arrive and they later threaten Dennis via text message. Keanu confronts the gang and they attack them both, though Phil sees them off again. The gang later kidnap Dennis but he is rescued by Keanu. Stuart gives Dennis a bag of weapons before he breaks into The Queen Vic again and is shot. Dennis is shocked when he hears Stuart has been shot and worries that the police are looking for him, telling Sharon that he heard the gunshot. \n\nOn Christmas Day 2019, Dennis learns of the affair between Sharon and Keanu; he sides with Phil and the other Mitchells. He stays at the Vic for a while, bonding with his mother's rival, Shirley. Sharon persuades him that Phil is using him, and Dennis eventually trusts Sharon again. Dennis envies how [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Clay Milner Russell) is now getting attention from Sharon and Bobby accidentally pushes Dennis into a table, when he insults her. Dennis bullies Bobby over his conversion to [[Islam]], putting anonymous Islamophobic posts online, leading to Bobby being brutally attacked and hospitalised, which Ian finds out. A pregnant Sharon plans a getaway with Dennis, but it is unknown to him that she plans on inviting Keanu too. When he learns of this, Dennis runs away to the boat party. Ian discovers Dennis and confront him over Bobby before locks Dennis in a cabin in the boat; however, when the boat crashes and takes on water, Ian busts open the door to save Dennis. Before they can get out, a tidal wave in the boat smashes into them knocking them unconscious and carrying them out of the boat. The pair float to the surface, where Ian regains his consciousness, however, Dennis dies after drowning on the boat.\n\n===Reception===\nKate White of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said that she thinks Dennis' nickname \"Denny\" is, \"the single most annoying thing in soap.

Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked \"real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs\". She stated: {{quote|It is disgraceful to see a publicly funded broadcaster deliberately spreading misinformation about the child protection process because it is too lazy and arrogant to get it right. We regularly give advice to programmes about social work storylines; we would like to know who advised ''EastEnders'' so badly. Social workers have a difficult enough job as it is. Unlike the writers and actors on ''EastEnders'', they have to step through those front doors that no one else wants to step through, and they do it on a daily basis, to protect children, not to target families. ''EastEnders''{{'}} shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a tough job even tougher.<ref name=\"Social Workers Outraged\" />}} Another social worker said \"Accurate procedures were not followed [when a character's baby was taken away]. Was it police protection, section 20? Where was the immediate risk to the baby? As a social worker, I was in tears, as was a colleague of mine, watching how our profession was portrayed on television.\"<ref name=\"Fury\" /> The BBC responded to BASW by saying: {{quote|{{bullet}}We understand you're unhappy with the current storyline concerning Lexi and Lola as you feel it portrays social workers inaccurately. We consulted with the programme's production team in writing our response and we'd like to assure you our intention is not to portray social workers in a negative light.<br />{{bullet}}Whilst the audience has seen how much Lola loves Lexi and how responsible she can be with her baby, we were careful to ensure that when the social worker was visiting, she generally saw only more worrying behaviour. Lola was often abrasive when speaking to the social worker and casual\u2014sometimes even flippant in her responses to the social worker's suggestions.<br />{{bullet}}Given that Lola is a young mother, who has been, until this episode, wearing an electronic tag (for criminal damage to the car lot), with a history of getting into trouble with the police, and is known to have had a difficult childhood herself (indeed, three generations of the family have been through the care system), it was clearly important for social services to be involved with the family in order to ensure that Lola could cope with having a baby. In the last few weeks the social worker witnessed a series of unfortunate incidents, including Lexi wearing a tea-towel as a makeshift nappy, reports of Lola not taking Lexi to the mother and baby group, a messy and unclean flat, and the discovery that Billy had lied to her about having a job.<br />{{bullet}}Under the circumstances, we believe the audience will have understood why she had to act to remove Lexi quickly when the allegation of assault is made against Lola by Alexa. There was no suggestion that the social worker's actions were anything other than a genuine desire to protect Lexi, or that her concerns about Lola were unreasonable, given the picture she and the previous social worker had formed over a substantial period of time. There was certainly no inference that her actions were anything personal against Lola or her family.<ref name=\"Social Workers Outraged\" /><ref name=\"Left in tears\" />}} A social worker who received the BBC's statement commented: {{quote|I don't think I need to spell out the ridiculousness of this response from the BBC and whether the grounds they claim, such as wearing a tea towel as a nappy, would constitute grounds for emergency removal in real life. I work in a long-term care team and take great offence at the suggestion that because Lola was in care there is an assumption that social services should be involved in her care of her child. Not that I am suggesting she doesn't need some support, but where is her aftercare worker?

Kirsty does not believe him, and suspects Carl forced Max into this position. In desperation for money, Kirsty has sex with Carl, and then steals \u00a31000 from him. Max is then acquitted of the crime and reunites with Kirsty. However, Carl then tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison, and this leads to Max ending his relationship with her.\n\nIn early 2014, Kirsty becomes concerned when Carl is nowhere to be seen, unaware that he has actually been murdered by [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]). She asks [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]) about Carl's whereabouts, but nobody knows where he is. When [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) reveals to Max that Tanya is in a new relationship, he takes Kirsty back. The reunion is short, however, when Kirsty makes the mistake of cooking the meal with wine, knowing that Max's daughter Lauren is an alcoholic. Max throws the meal at the wall and Kirsty is thrown out of the house. The next day, Kirsty is homeless and Max gives her \u00a320 to live on, so she seeks advice from Shirley. At [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) engagement party, Kirsty acts drunk and tries to hug Max, stealing his car keys. Max, Lauren and many other locals step outside to find Kirsty in Max's car. She insults Max and throws away her wedding ring before leaving Walford.\n\n=== Development ===\nWareing knew about the part of Kirsty in April 2012, and discovered she had the part in August at a meeting with executive producer [[Lorraine Newman]] and series consultant [[Simon Ashdown]], who offered her the role. She started filming at the end of October, knowing her first episode would be on Christmas Day. She described her first scene as \"really weird\", \"surreal\" and \"bizarre\" because she had grown up watching ''EastEnders''. The character was kept a secret, with no announcement being made, and the only people Wareing told she had the part were her father and brother. She found it more difficult over time to keep the secret, as for her, it was \"exciting and nerve-wracking\" and she wanted to share her news. She had to tell people who saw her arriving at [[Elstree Studios|BBC Elstree Studios]] that she was temping in the office or playing a background role.<ref name=\"Digital Spy Kirsty interview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a447215/eastenders-kierston-wareing-talks-kirsty-branning-role.html|title='EastEnders': Kierston Wareing talks Kirsty Branning role|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=25 December 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWareing said in an interview released after her first episode was broadcast, that she loves playing Kirsty, saying \"there are a lot of places she can go, I feel.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy Kirsty interview\" /> She said that Kirsty has \"a lot of sides to her\", meaning there are a lot of directions in which the character could be taken.

When walking home one night, [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) notices Les being handed money by [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) grandson, [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]). Fatboy tries to tell Dot what Les and Charlie are up to, but is unsuccessful. In July, Les hires [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) at the undertakers, however he is disappointed when Billy doesn't turn up for work on his first day. Pam is upset when Les insults [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) while drunk, fearful it will reveal a big secret they have been keeping; that she euthanised their dying son, Lawrie. Billy eventually establishes a good working relationship with Les and a friendship as they spend Christmas together. Billy discovers the business is deeply in debt and forces Les to tell Pam this. They vow no more secrets, but after Les meets with his 'other woman', [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) and gives her an expensive necklace. Claudette and Pam are revealed to be old friends, as Claudette is a foster mother and Pam used to help children in care. Les holidays in Gran Canaria with Claudette, although Pam sees it as a coincidence when she learns from Claudette's foster daughter [[Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) that they are both there at the same time.\n\nLes arranges a party for the centenary of Coker & Sons, and Pam gets upset at the thought that their grandson, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), will not attend. The same day, Paul returns but is cold towards Les. He reveals he is aware of his long running affair with Claudette and that was why he went to work abroad in the first place, not because of Pam's decision to euthanise his father as they previously believed. Paul threatens to expose the affair to Pam so Les tries to end things with Claudette, but Claudette tells Les that it will not be that easy. Claudette's son [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) then becomes aware of the relationship between her and Les, and Paul tells Pam about it. Pam then finds Les's tie at Claudette's house, and when Les and Claudette give conflicting explanations, Pam leaves to stay with her sister. Les becomes very distraught at her departure, and Claudette urges him to tell Pam the truth, just as Pam returns and walks in on them together. Shortly after Claudette leaves the house, Pam urges Les to end the affair or their marriage is over. Two months later, Les visits Claudette for comfort after Pam refuses to speak to him on Lawrie's birthday. He later calls Claudette, telling her he cannot stop thinking about her, and makes an excuse to Pam to go and be with Claudette again. He is then caught in his underwear in Claudette's house by Donna, who concludes they are having an affair, and despite Les and Claudette denying it, Donna tells Pam what she saw. Pam then goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying gifts from Les until Claudette says the presents are not hers, and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam asks Les, he reveals that Christine is his secret [[Transvestism|feminine alter ego]], where he dresses up in women's clothes and has done so since he was seven years old, but after they married he did not need Christine until Lawrie died, when the alter-ego became a grief outlet for him, and Claudette has been supporting this secret. Pam is horrified at him having lied to, and tells Les he disgusts her. However, Pam agrees to \"meet\" Christine. Les, as Christine, explains that this is how he can cope with things, as Christine is more open than Les, and he is still the same person. Pam apparently begins to accept this, but when Paul interrupts, Pam says she cannot accept it, so packs a bag and leaves, while Paul comforts Les. Paul manages to convince Pam to return home to talk to Les, but when she gets hesitant again, Les moves out to give Pam some time to think, and he moves in with Billy. Pam and Les have dinner together but she still cannot get the image of him dressed as Christine out of her mind, soLes burns all of Christine's clothes and photos and Pam agrees to take things one day at a time, but [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) is watching and finds and pockets a surviving photo of Les dressed as Christine. Shortly after, Paul encourages Les to remind Pam of the man she first fell in love with and she agrees to his moving back in as long as they sleep in separate beds.\n\nA few months later, Les spurns Babe, so she sends Les an anonymous email, blackmailing him over his crossdressing. When Pam notices money has been paid from their account, Les admits he has been blackmailed. The blackmailing continues regularly, and Pam starts to suspect Babe, and eventually they discover the truth. Les confides in Claudette and says he misses Christine, so she gives him some of her clothes and makeup that she still has. Stressed, Les dresses up again but is caught by Paul. Paul refuses to destroy Christine's things for Les, saying Les should not suffer for who he is. When Pam finds Les dressed as Christine, she chastises him and he suffers a heart attack. Billy sees him as he enters the ambulance. Billy calls Les a \"pervert\" to Pam, so she fires him from the funeral parlour. Pam then tells Les they should retire away from London and Les agrees; when Paul and his boyfriend [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) find out, they decide they should take over the running of the funeral parlour. Paul's mother, [[Jenny Rawlinson]], arrives looking for him, but he only assumes she is the blackmailer and orders her away. Pam and Les vow to tell Paul who she is, but Paul is killed in a homophobic attack. Pam struggles to cope, refusing to talk to Les about Paul, so he considers dressing as Christine; he explains why he cross-dresses to Billy and gives him his job back. Les then decides to be strong for Pam so tells Claudette he will no longer be Christine, but the blackmailing continues, with Pam refusing to go to the police, but she tells Claudette that Babe is the blackmailer. After four months of blackmail, Claudette reveals this to Babe's family, and Babe, who has just been attacked by [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) and come close to death, tells Claudette that she now sees how bad she has been and regrets everything, so it will stop. Les and Pam later attend a court hearing for Paul's killers. Les calls one of them, [[Simon Atmore]] ([[Tom Palmer (actor)|Tom Palmer]]), a liar after he denies having anything to do with Paul's death. When they arrive home, Pam tells him he needs to be Christine again. Les later suffers a small heart attack after talking to [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) who tries to comfort him and he eventually dresses up as Christine. Les then asks Pam if she would consider leaving Walford together for a fresh start after the trial is over which she agrees. Les and Pam are delighted when Babe returns all of their money. However, they decide to leave and Les appoints Billy as the manager of Coker and Sons. Pam packs a box of Christine's wig and clothes suggesting she has accepted her. After saying an emotional farewell to his friends and after giving Billy his funeral hat, Les departs with Pam for a new life in [[Worthing]].\n\n=== Development and reception ===\nHaving been originally introduced as the funeral director who arranged [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]]' ([[Pam St. Clement]]) funeral, Sloman appeared in one episode on 9 January 2012 as a guest character.<ref name=\"9jan\"/> He then appeared in five episodes between June and July 2012.<ref name=\"20jun\"/><ref name=\"5jul\"/><ref name=\"10jul\"/><ref name=\"17jul\"/><ref name=\"31jul\"/> Les was reintroduced for one episode on 25 March 2014 when he arranges [[Nick Cotton]]'s ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) funeral.<ref name=\"Les2014\"/> Following this, Sloman was reintroduced as a regular cast member with Les' wife, [[Pam Coker|Pam]] ([[Lin Blakley]]) being introduced also.<ref name=\"LesPam14\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/entries/516c9e6c-c815-3d02-a577-fa34928043d8|title=New funeral parlour opens on Albert Square|date=4 April 2014|website=BBC}}</ref> Executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] said \"Les and Pam are part of our plans to rejuvenate the show's older generation.

When he misbehaves in school, and around Sharon's friends when she is not there, Sharon refuses to believe that Dennis is lying about his behaviour, and blames those that he has upset when Sharon's childhood friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and his wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) inform her over Dennis' misbehaviour.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2015, after overhearing Sharon and Phil during dinner, Dennis (now played by [[Bleu Landau]]) tells his friend and Ian's son [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) that he knows he killed his half-sister, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). When Dennis and Bobby race their bikes, they fight on the Walford Common and Phil and Ian find Dennis. Phil is drunk whilst driving and crashes the car while distracted. Dennis is severely injured and taken to hospital. He has a [[subdural haematoma]] which requires an operation. Ian takes responsibility by saying he was driving, making a deal with Phil. However, Phil confesses that he was the one who drove the car, so when Dennis is discharged from the hospital, Sharon takes him away to stay with her father [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]). Dennis returns a week and a half later with Sharon for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Honey Mitchell]]'s ([[Emma Barton]]) second engagement party only to find Phil on the floor having collapsed from coughing up blood. Sharon reveals to [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) that Gavin hit Dennis during their stay and that is the reason why they left. However, in July 2016, Dennis misses Gavin and has a second mobile phone to which he only contacts Gavin from. Sharon discovers this and is furious, but is later unnerved when Gavin collects Dennis from school, and realises that he could easily abduct Dennis.\n\nIn November 2016, Sharon becomes concerned about Dennis's behaviour and decides to apply to send him to an alternative high school. Dennis takes the stabbing of a school friend, Eddie Kendall, hard and confides in his stepsister [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) that he does not want Phil to die, who has rejected a transplant. Phil overhears this and announces to his family he is going on the transplant list. Sharon decides to let Dennis go to Eddie's funeral. On the day of Eddie's funeral, Dennis is unsure about going, but Phil encourages him so he does not regret it and can say goodbye. Dennis later attends the funeral. In December 2016, Dennis gets a part in the Christmas show, and volunteers to take a part that involves his and Louise's characters kissing, saying he would not mind it, but the part is given to someone else. He is later reprimanded when he gets caught watching Louise and other girls getting changed. Sharon punishes Dennis for this but Phil says he was doing what normal boys do.\n\nWhile Sharon is on holiday with Phil, Sharon's best friend, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]), looks after Dennis and Louise. In March 2017, Dennis sees Michelle and 17-year-old [[Preston Cooper]] (Martin Anzor) kissing so starts blackmailing Michelle into buying him things and letting him stay off school. Michelle is furious when she finds out Dennis bought a video game using her credit card and Dennis brands her a paedophile, resulting in a slap from Michelle. Louise does not witness this but catches Michelle calling Dennis a \"brat\". Dennis demands \u00a3100 from Michelle to keep quiet about her hitting him, but she refuses and he kicks her. When Louise finds him, she tries to get through to him over arguing with Michelle and he reveals that Michelle and Preston are having an affair. The affair is revealed which leads to Michelle crashing Phil's car and Sharon returning and convincing Preston to return to the United States in April 2017. Sharon then tells Dennis and Louise to be nice to Michelle. When Louise has a party with her friends, [[Madison Drake]] and [[Alexandra D'Costa]] ([[Seraphina Beh]] and [[Sydney Craven]]), Dennis turns up and Louise lets him stay on the condition he keeps quiet about them having alcohol. Louise gets drunk after her drink is spiked and is sick, and as she staggers outside, she coughs up blood and collapses, which panics Dennis and those around Louise. In July 2017, Dennis and [[Will Mitchell]] (Freddie Phillips) plan to throw eggs at [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris (actor)|Zack Morris]]), but accidentally hit his half-sister, [[Bernadette Taylor]] (Clair Norris). Keegan gets into Dennis's house and tells them Bernadette is pregnant. Dennis and Will apologise and Keegan attempts to force Dennis to smoke a cigarette, but is caught and thrown out by Michelle. After this, Dennis forgives Michelle for hitting him. In August 2017, Sharon and Phil receive a date for Dennis' adoption hearing. Dennis asks Phil if he wants him to change his surname to Mitchell upon his adoption as he wants to keep his current surname, which Phil does not mind.\n\nIn 2018, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) gets Dennis to steal the keys to The Queen Vic as part of his plan to take revenge on the Carter family. Dennis wants a new phone but Sharon refuses so he buys a stolen phone from [[Jagger Rawley]] (Aaron Thomas Ward), and he then hides a bag of phones in the garage for him, which [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]) finds. Phil sees off Jagger's gang when they arrive and they later threaten Dennis via text message. Keanu confronts the gang and they attack them both, though Phil sees them off again. The gang later kidnap Dennis but he is rescued by Keanu. Stuart gives Dennis a bag of weapons before he breaks into The Queen Vic again and is shot. Dennis is shocked when he hears Stuart has been shot and worries that the police are looking for him, telling Sharon that he heard the gunshot. \n\nOn Christmas Day 2019, Dennis learns of the affair between Sharon and Keanu; he sides with Phil and the other Mitchells. He stays at the Vic for a while, bonding with his mother's rival, Shirley. Sharon persuades him that Phil is using him, and Dennis eventually trusts Sharon again. Dennis envies how [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Clay Milner Russell) is now getting attention from Sharon and Bobby accidentally pushes Dennis into a table, when he insults her. Dennis bullies Bobby over his conversion to [[Islam]], putting anonymous Islamophobic posts online, leading to Bobby being brutally attacked and hospitalised, which Ian finds out. A pregnant Sharon plans a getaway with Dennis, but it is unknown to him that she plans on inviting Keanu too. When he learns of this, Dennis runs away to the boat party. Ian discovers Dennis and confront him over Bobby before locks Dennis in a cabin in the boat; however, when the boat crashes and takes on water, Ian busts open the door to save Dennis. Before they can get out, a tidal wave in the boat smashes into them knocking them unconscious and carrying them out of the boat. The pair float to the surface, where Ian regains his consciousness, however, Dennis dies after drowning on the boat.\n\n===Reception===\nKate White of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said that she thinks Dennis' nickname \"Denny\" is, \"the single most annoying thing in soap.

Lola was often abrasive when speaking to the social worker and casual\u2014sometimes even flippant in her responses to the social worker's suggestions.<br />{{bullet}}Given that Lola is a young mother, who has been, until this episode, wearing an electronic tag (for criminal damage to the car lot), with a history of getting into trouble with the police, and is known to have had a difficult childhood herself (indeed, three generations of the family have been through the care system), it was clearly important for social services to be involved with the family in order to ensure that Lola could cope with having a baby. In the last few weeks the social worker witnessed a series of unfortunate incidents, including Lexi wearing a tea-towel as a makeshift nappy, reports of Lola not taking Lexi to the mother and baby group, a messy and unclean flat, and the discovery that Billy had lied to her about having a job.<br />{{bullet}}Under the circumstances, we believe the audience will have understood why she had to act to remove Lexi quickly when the allegation of assault is made against Lola by Alexa. There was no suggestion that the social worker's actions were anything other than a genuine desire to protect Lexi, or that her concerns about Lola were unreasonable, given the picture she and the previous social worker had formed over a substantial period of time. There was certainly no inference that her actions were anything personal against Lola or her family.<ref name=\"Social Workers Outraged\" /><ref name=\"Left in tears\" />}} A social worker who received the BBC's statement commented: {{quote|I don't think I need to spell out the ridiculousness of this response from the BBC and whether the grounds they claim, such as wearing a tea towel as a nappy, would constitute grounds for emergency removal in real life. I work in a long-term care team and take great offence at the suggestion that because Lola was in care there is an assumption that social services should be involved in her care of her child. Not that I am suggesting she doesn't need some support, but where is her aftercare worker? I am always disappointed at how social workers are portrayed in ''EastEnders'', but this was the last resort.

Max is then acquitted of the crime and reunites with Kirsty. However, Carl then tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison, and this leads to Max ending his relationship with her.\n\nIn early 2014, Kirsty becomes concerned when Carl is nowhere to be seen, unaware that he has actually been murdered by [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]).

When [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) reveals to Max that Tanya is in a new relationship, he takes Kirsty back. The reunion is short, however, when Kirsty makes the mistake of cooking the meal with wine, knowing that Max's daughter Lauren is an alcoholic. Max throws the meal at the wall and Kirsty is thrown out of the house. The next day, Kirsty is homeless and Max gives her \u00a320 to live on, so she seeks advice from Shirley. At [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) engagement party, Kirsty acts drunk and tries to hug Max, stealing his car keys.

She described her first scene as \"really weird\", \"surreal\" and \"bizarre\" because she had grown up watching ''EastEnders''. The character was kept a secret, with no announcement being made, and the only people Wareing told she had the part were her father and brother. She found it more difficult over time to keep the secret, as for her, it was \"exciting and nerve-wracking\" and she wanted to share her news.

They also got a 36-yard field goal by kicker [[Jason Elam]] to make the score 10\u20130 at halftime.

Although Favre stated that he had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another [[Super Bowl]] victory. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing to do with what the Packers did or did not do. He said, seemingly contradictory to Cook's statements, that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, \"I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to.\" But since he had to make his decision right there and then he felt that he needed to retire. He was eligible for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013.

Practices were moved inside the [[Don Hutson Center]] during inclement weather. [[St. Norbert College]] served as the team base for all living arrangements for the 51st consecutive season. Players were expected to report on July 27, and practices commenced the following day and continued through August 27. Throughout the thirty one day span, seventeen included public practices. For the third straight year, night practices were again a part of the training camp schedule under Head Coach Mike McCarthy. Seven night practices, all beginning at 6:30&nbsp;p.m., were scheduled.\n\nDuring the first day of practice, [[Brett Favre]] did not file his reinstatement papers and did not appear at camp. Favre told GM [[Ted Thompson]] he would give him a couple of days to work out a trade before he reported. The only player on the active roster absent was RB [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] who was going through a contract dispute. All of the 2008 draft class was signed by the start of camp and participated.\n\nAfter the first day McCarthy stated that he thought the evening practice was sloppy, as the morning practice was. There again were many penalties before the snap. That is no surprise on Day 1, though. \"As a whole, I thought the pad level was high on both sides of the ball. I thought the footwork was sloppy. It looked like we were in mud at times. So, we'll look at the film.\" The pace of the practice was excellent\u201414&nbsp;minutes ahead of schedule.<ref name=\"TC1D\">{{cite news|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/ic/blogs/insider/2008/07/evening-practice-is-under-way.html|title=Evening practice is sloppy, toolimit|publisher=greenbaypressgazette.com|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2008-07-29|author=greenbaypressgazette.com Beat Writers}}</ref>\n\nDuring the evening practice on July 29, the Packers got word that [[Brett Favre]] had submitted him papers for reinstatement.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 29, [[ESPN]]'s [[NFL Live]] was broadcasting from Packers camp. Much of the broadcast circled around Brett Favre's return to football with minor focus on [[Aaron Rodgers]] performance as well as [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] and his current contract holdout situation.\n\nOn Thursday, the Packers did not have a formal practice but the team was addressed in the afternoon by former White House press secretary [[Ari Fleischer]]. During the late afternoon, it was reported by ESPN that [[Brett Favre]] had chartered a flight to Green Bay and would arrive later in the day in time to attend camp on Friday. After a series of delays, the flight was canceled and Favre did not fly to Green Bay.\n\nOn Saturday, August 2, it was announced that [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] came to terms with a four-year deal that could be worth as much as $30 million. [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] was in attendance for the 2008 Family Night scrimmage on Sunday August 3 but did not participate. A few hours before the scrimmage had taken place, quarterback [[Brett Favre]] was officially reinstated by [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Roger Goodell]] and landed in [[Wisconsin]].\n\nOn Monday, August 4, [[Brett Favre]] was officially added to the Packers active roster and it was announced that he would now compete against [[Aaron Rodgers]] for the Packers starting quarterback job. After a long conversation with [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] over the next couple of days, McCarthy felt that Favre was not committed to the team and they began working out a trade.\n\nAfter Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]], new starting quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] became the target of heckling by several disgruntled fans at training camp for the next couple of days.\n\nAfter the Packers preseason game on August 11, it was apparent that second string rookie quarterback [[Brian Brohm]] was in danger of being passed on the depth chart by another rookie quarterback, [[Matt Flynn]] due to Brian's lack of success in the preseason contest.\n\nAnother camp battle that had emerged is one between rookie offensive guard [[Josh Sitton]], [[Daryn Colledge]] and [[Allen Barbre]] for the starting left guard spot. Josh Sitton replaced right guard [[Jason Spitz]] in training camp due to Spitz being moved over to center in place of the injured [[Scott Wells]]. Sitton played so well in camp and in the first preseason game that he is now still taking reps with the first string offense at left guard even after the return of center Scott Wells.\n\n====Family night scrimmage====\n\nOn August 3, Lambeau Field held a full pads inter-team scrimmage that was delayed by rain and lightning. The scrimmage finally started around 8:00&nbsp;p.m. CST in front of 56,600 in attendance.\n\nHead Coach Mike McCarthy has talked about the defense being the starting point and common thread that will run through the team in 2008, and on Sunday night, several members of the secondary made an impact. \"As a whole, I thought their production was outstanding,\" McCarthy said of the defense. \"I really thought they flew to the ball. It looked to me, from not studying it, it looked like they did a good job with the bump at the line of scrimmage, disrupting the routes. I thought the defense had a very good night.\"<ref name=\"famnight\">{{cite news|url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/08/03/2/|title=Family Night Notebook: Secondary Looks Sharp | publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=2008-08-04|date=2008-08-03|author=Fanning, Tom|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080902064514/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/08/03/2/ |archivedate = September 2, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRookie cornerback [[Pat Lee (American football)|Pat Lee]] led the team with four passes defensed, Cornerback [[Tramon Williams]], who missed a good part of practice this week with a hip flexor injury, was back on the field and posted two pass breakups, both on third-down plays. Safety [[Charlie Peprah]] made his presence felt with three tackles and a pass breakup, as well as one of the bigger hits of the night. Safety [[Aaron Rouse]] posted the lone takeaway of the night when he intercepted a desperation heave by Rodgers to the back of the end zone intended for Jennings as time ticked away in the two-minute drill.<ref name=\"famnight\"/>\n\nOne area that impressed on Sunday night was the punt return game for the Packers. Rookie wide receiver Brett Swain was credited with two returns for 80&nbsp;yards, including a 66-yarder. He wasn't the only player to post a big play during the special teams work, with cornerback Will Blackmon recording a 56-yard return. Also, Punter [[Jon Ryan]] averaged 54.8&nbsp;yards on his four punts.<ref name=\"famnight\"/>\n\nMost of the team participated with exception to recently{{When|date=February 2011}} re-signed running back [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], and cornerbacks [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and [[Charles Woodson]]. All three were healthy but did not participate. [[Brett Favre]] also was not in attendance due to the fact that he was just reinstated back into the NFL earlier in the day.\n\nSix other players did not participate due to injury. This list included defensive tackles [[Justin Harrell]] (knee) and [[Ryan Pickett]] (back), running back [[DeShawn Wynn]] (concussion), cornerback [[Condrew Allen]] (knee), center [[Scott Wells]] (trunk) and defensive end [[Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila]] (knee).<ref name=\"famnight\"/>\n\n==Final roster==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#213d30; color:#fc0; text-align:center;\"|'''Green Bay Packers 2008 final roster'''\n|-\n|  style=\"font-size:95%; vertical-align:top;\"| '''Quarterbacks'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">11</span> ''[[Brian Brohm]]''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">10</span> ''[[Matt Flynn]]''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">12</span> [[Aaron Rodgers]]\n\n'''Running Backs'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">25</span> [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">35</span> [[Korey Hall]] FB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">32</span> [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">30</span> [[John Kuhn]] FB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">42</span> [[DeShawn Wynn]]\n\n'''Wide Receivers'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">80</span> [[Donald Driver]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">85</span> [[Greg Jennings]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">89</span> [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">82</span> [[Ruvell Martin]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">87</span> ''[[Jordy Nelson]]''\n\n'''Tight Ends'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">88</span> ''[[Jermichael Finley]]''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">84</span> [[Tory Humphrey]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">86</span> [[Donald Lee (American football)|Donald Lee]]\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n|  style=\"font-size:95%; vertical-align:top;\"|'''Offensive Linemen'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">78</span> [[Allen Barbre]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">76</span> [[Chad Clifton]] T\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">73</span> [[Daryn Colledge]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">68</span> ''[[Breno Giacomini]]'' T\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">67</span> [[Nevin McCaskill]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">75</span> [[Tony Moll]] T\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">71</span> ''[[Josh Sitton]]'' G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">72</span> [[Jason Spitz]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">63</span> [[Scott Wells (American football)|Scott Wells]] C\n\n'''Defensive Linemen'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">90</span> [[Colin Cole (American football)|Colin Cole]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">91</span> [[Justin Harrell]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">57</span> [[Jason Hunter (American football)|Jason Hunter]] DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">97</span> [[Johnny Jolly]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">74</span> [[Aaron Kampman]] DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">98</span> [[Alfred Malone]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">96</span> [[Michael Montgomery]] DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">79</span> [[Ryan Pickett]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">99</span> ''[[Jeremy Thompson (American football)|Jeremy Thompson]]'' DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">69</span> ''[[Anthony Toribio]]'' DT\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n|  style=\"font-size:95%; vertical-align:top;\"| '''Linebackers'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">55</span> [[Desmond Bishop]] MLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">54</span> [[Brandon Chillar]] OLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">53</span> [[Spencer Havner]] OLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">50</span> [[A.

Green Bay struggled early to move the ball, but a 56-yard [[Aaron Rodgers]] pass to [[Greg Jennings]] set the Packers up with a 1st and goal at the Vikings 6. The Packers scored 4 plays later on a 3rd down pass from Aaron Rodgers to fullback [[Korey Hall]]. Punt returner [[Will Blackmon]] also scored in the 3rd quarter on a 76-yard punt return to give the Packers a commanding 17\u20136 lead. Later in the 3rd, the Vikings scored a TD paired with a failed 2-point conversion attempt. The Packers responded with a 57-yard run by [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] to the Minnesota 2 that set up a 1-yard touchdown rush by Aaron Rodgers to make the score 24\u201312. The Vikings [[Adrian Peterson]] scored a 3-yard rushing touchdown on their next drive to bring the Packers lead back to 5 points with 2:43 left in the 4th quarter. The following Vikings onside kick was knocked out of bounds after touching safety [[Atari Bigby]].

It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach [[Tony Dungy]] thought otherwise and [[Peyton Manning]] left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision.\n\nAfter the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR [[Donald Driver]] to the 35-yard line.

After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's [[Adam Vinatieri]] attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT [[Johnny Jolly]].\n\nThe Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts [[Tim Jennings]] was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&nbsp;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]]. The highlight of the drive took place when FB [[Korey Hall]] received a pass from [[Aaron Rodgers]] and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by [[Mason Crosby]] to extend the lead to 27\u20137.\n\nThe Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by [[Peyton Manning]].

Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to [[Dallas Clark]] earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by [[Charles Woodson]] but S [[Aaron Rouse]] batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR [[Anthony Gonzalez]] at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&nbsp;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34\u20137 with about 4:30 remaining in the game.\n\nIn a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to [[Anthony Gonzalez]] at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to [[Dallas Clark]] and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1-yard line. RB [[Dominic Rhodes]] rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34\u201314.\n\nThe Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by [[Charles Woodson]]. [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] rushed for 9&nbsp;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two [[Aaron Rodgers]] kneel downs sealed the dominating victory.\n\nWith the win, the [[Green Bay Packers]] improved their record to 4\u20133 going into the bye week.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Week 9===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Packers\n|V1= 0|V2= 10|V3=3 |V4=3 |VOT=0\n|Host=Titans\n|H1=3 |H2=10 |H3=3 |H4=0 |HOT=3\n|Date=November 2\n|Location=[[LP Field]], [[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n|StartTime=1:00 p.m.\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=69,143\n|Weather=Sunny, 69\u00b0F\n|Referee=[[Bill Leavy]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kenny Albert]], [[Daryl Johnston]], and [[Tony Siragusa]]\n|TVStation=[[NFL on Fox|Fox]]\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n[[File:Derrick-Frost-TitansvsPackers-Nov-2-08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Derrick Frost]] punts at Tennessee, week 9]]\nComing off their bye week, the Packers flew to [[LP Field]] for a Week 9 interconference duel with the unbeaten [[Tennessee Titans]].

Until the [[2017 Green Bay Packers season|2017 season]], this was the last season in which the Packers did not qualify for the playoffs.\n\nIt was the first season since 1991 that quarterback [[Brett Favre]] was not on the team's roster. Favre retired in March, decided to come back over the summer and was ultimately traded to the [[New York Jets]] after the team told Favre playing in Green Bay again was not an option.

The Packers then traded pick 4\u2013128 to the [[St Louis Rams]] for picks 5\u2013137 and 7\u2013217.

Although Favre stated that he had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another [[Super Bowl]] victory. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing to do with what the Packers did or did not do. He said, seemingly contradictory to Cook's statements, that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, \"I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to.\" But since he had to make his decision right there and then he felt that he needed to retire. He was eligible for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013. The Packers also planned to retire Favre's No. 4 jersey during their regular season opener against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on September 8.

Practices were moved inside the [[Don Hutson Center]] during inclement weather. [[St. Norbert College]] served as the team base for all living arrangements for the 51st consecutive season. Players were expected to report on July 27, and practices commenced the following day and continued through August 27. Throughout the thirty one day span, seventeen included public practices. For the third straight year, night practices were again a part of the training camp schedule under Head Coach Mike McCarthy. Seven night practices, all beginning at 6:30&nbsp;p.m., were scheduled.\n\nDuring the first day of practice, [[Brett Favre]] did not file his reinstatement papers and did not appear at camp. Favre told GM [[Ted Thompson]] he would give him a couple of days to work out a trade before he reported. The only player on the active roster absent was RB [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] who was going through a contract dispute. All of the 2008 draft class was signed by the start of camp and participated.\n\nAfter the first day McCarthy stated that he thought the evening practice was sloppy, as the morning practice was. There again were many penalties before the snap. That is no surprise on Day 1, though. \"As a whole, I thought the pad level was high on both sides of the ball. I thought the footwork was sloppy. It looked like we were in mud at times. So, we'll look at the film.\" The pace of the practice was excellent\u201414&nbsp;minutes ahead of schedule.<ref name=\"TC1D\">{{cite news|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/ic/blogs/insider/2008/07/evening-practice-is-under-way.html|title=Evening practice is sloppy, toolimit|publisher=greenbaypressgazette.com|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2008-07-29|author=greenbaypressgazette.com Beat Writers}}</ref>\n\nDuring the evening practice on July 29, the Packers got word that [[Brett Favre]] had submitted him papers for reinstatement.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 29, [[ESPN]]'s [[NFL Live]] was broadcasting from Packers camp. Much of the broadcast circled around Brett Favre's return to football with minor focus on [[Aaron Rodgers]] performance as well as [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] and his current contract holdout situation.\n\nOn Thursday, the Packers did not have a formal practice but the team was addressed in the afternoon by former White House press secretary [[Ari Fleischer]]. During the late afternoon, it was reported by ESPN that [[Brett Favre]] had chartered a flight to Green Bay and would arrive later in the day in time to attend camp on Friday. After a series of delays, the flight was canceled and Favre did not fly to Green Bay.\n\nOn Saturday, August 2, it was announced that [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] came to terms with a four-year deal that could be worth as much as $30 million. [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] was in attendance for the 2008 Family Night scrimmage on Sunday August 3 but did not participate. A few hours before the scrimmage had taken place, quarterback [[Brett Favre]] was officially reinstated by [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Roger Goodell]] and landed in [[Wisconsin]].\n\nOn Monday, August 4, [[Brett Favre]] was officially added to the Packers active roster and it was announced that he would now compete against [[Aaron Rodgers]] for the Packers starting quarterback job. After a long conversation with [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] over the next couple of days, McCarthy felt that Favre was not committed to the team and they began working out a trade.\n\nAfter Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]], new starting quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] became the target of heckling by several disgruntled fans at training camp for the next couple of days.\n\nAfter the Packers preseason game on August 11, it was apparent that second string rookie quarterback [[Brian Brohm]] was in danger of being passed on the depth chart by another rookie quarterback, [[Matt Flynn]] due to Brian's lack of success in the preseason contest.\n\nAnother camp battle that had emerged is one between rookie offensive guard [[Josh Sitton]], [[Daryn Colledge]] and [[Allen Barbre]] for the starting left guard spot. Josh Sitton replaced right guard [[Jason Spitz]] in training camp due to Spitz being moved over to center in place of the injured [[Scott Wells]]. Sitton played so well in camp and in the first preseason game that he is now still taking reps with the first string offense at left guard even after the return of center Scott Wells.\n\n====Family night scrimmage====\n\nOn August 3, Lambeau Field held a full pads inter-team scrimmage that was delayed by rain and lightning. The scrimmage finally started around 8:00&nbsp;p.m. CST in front of 56,600 in attendance.\n\nHead Coach Mike McCarthy has talked about the defense being the starting point and common thread that will run through the team in 2008, and on Sunday night, several members of the secondary made an impact. \"As a whole, I thought their production was outstanding,\" McCarthy said of the defense. \"I really thought they flew to the ball. It looked to me, from not studying it, it looked like they did a good job with the bump at the line of scrimmage, disrupting the routes. I thought the defense had a very good night.\"<ref name=\"famnight\">{{cite news|url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/08/03/2/|title=Family Night Notebook: Secondary Looks Sharp | publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=2008-08-04|date=2008-08-03|author=Fanning, Tom|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080902064514/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/08/03/2/ |archivedate = September 2, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRookie cornerback [[Pat Lee (American football)|Pat Lee]] led the team with four passes defensed, Cornerback [[Tramon Williams]], who missed a good part of practice this week with a hip flexor injury, was back on the field and posted two pass breakups, both on third-down plays. Safety [[Charlie Peprah]] made his presence felt with three tackles and a pass breakup, as well as one of the bigger hits of the night. Safety [[Aaron Rouse]] posted the lone takeaway of the night when he intercepted a desperation heave by Rodgers to the back of the end zone intended for Jennings as time ticked away in the two-minute drill.<ref name=\"famnight\"/>\n\nOne area that impressed on Sunday night was the punt return game for the Packers. Rookie wide receiver Brett Swain was credited with two returns for 80&nbsp;yards, including a 66-yarder. He wasn't the only player to post a big play during the special teams work, with cornerback Will Blackmon recording a 56-yard return. Also, Punter [[Jon Ryan]] averaged 54.8&nbsp;yards on his four punts.<ref name=\"famnight\"/>\n\nMost of the team participated with exception to recently{{When|date=February 2011}} re-signed running back [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], and cornerbacks [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and [[Charles Woodson]]. All three were healthy but did not participate. [[Brett Favre]] also was not in attendance due to the fact that he was just reinstated back into the NFL earlier in the day.\n\nSix other players did not participate due to injury. This list included defensive tackles [[Justin Harrell]] (knee) and [[Ryan Pickett]] (back), running back [[DeShawn Wynn]] (concussion), cornerback [[Condrew Allen]] (knee), center [[Scott Wells]] (trunk) and defensive end [[Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila]] (knee).<ref name=\"famnight\"/>\n\n==Final roster==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#213d30; color:#fc0; text-align:center;\"|'''Green Bay Packers 2008 final roster'''\n|-\n|  style=\"font-size:95%; vertical-align:top;\"| '''Quarterbacks'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">11</span> ''[[Brian Brohm]]''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">10</span> ''[[Matt Flynn]]''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">12</span> [[Aaron Rodgers]]\n\n'''Running Backs'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">25</span> [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">35</span> [[Korey Hall]] FB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">32</span> [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">30</span> [[John Kuhn]] FB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">42</span> [[DeShawn Wynn]]\n\n'''Wide Receivers'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">80</span> [[Donald Driver]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">85</span> [[Greg Jennings]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">89</span> [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">82</span> [[Ruvell Martin]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">87</span> ''[[Jordy Nelson]]''\n\n'''Tight Ends'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">88</span> ''[[Jermichael Finley]]''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">84</span> [[Tory Humphrey]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">86</span> [[Donald Lee (American football)|Donald Lee]]\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n|  style=\"font-size:95%; vertical-align:top;\"|'''Offensive Linemen'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">78</span> [[Allen Barbre]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">76</span> [[Chad Clifton]] T\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">73</span> [[Daryn Colledge]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">68</span> ''[[Breno Giacomini]]'' T\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">67</span> [[Nevin McCaskill]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">75</span> [[Tony Moll]] T\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">71</span> ''[[Josh Sitton]]'' G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">72</span> [[Jason Spitz]] G\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">63</span> [[Scott Wells (American football)|Scott Wells]] C\n\n'''Defensive Linemen'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">90</span> [[Colin Cole (American football)|Colin Cole]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">91</span> [[Justin Harrell]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">57</span> [[Jason Hunter (American football)|Jason Hunter]] DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">97</span> [[Johnny Jolly]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">74</span> [[Aaron Kampman]] DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">98</span> [[Alfred Malone]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">96</span> [[Michael Montgomery]] DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">79</span> [[Ryan Pickett]] DT\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">99</span> ''[[Jeremy Thompson (American football)|Jeremy Thompson]]'' DE\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">69</span> ''[[Anthony Toribio]]'' DT\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n|  style=\"font-size:95%; vertical-align:top;\"| '''Linebackers'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">55</span> [[Desmond Bishop]] MLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">54</span> [[Brandon Chillar]] OLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">53</span> [[Spencer Havner]] OLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">50</span> [[A.

It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach [[Tony Dungy]] thought otherwise and [[Peyton Manning]] left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision.\n\nAfter the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR [[Donald Driver]] to the 35-yard line.

FS [[Nick Collins]] who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&nbsp;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24\u20137 lead early in the 3rd.\n\nAfter the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE [[Dallas Clark]]. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's [[Adam Vinatieri]] attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT [[Johnny Jolly]].\n\nThe Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts [[Tim Jennings]] was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&nbsp;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]]. The highlight of the drive took place when FB [[Korey Hall]] received a pass from [[Aaron Rodgers]] and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by [[Mason Crosby]] to extend the lead to 27\u20137.\n\nThe Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by [[Peyton Manning]]. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]]. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE [[Tory Humphrey]] and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest.\n\nThe Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]], but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest.\n\nWith time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to [[Dallas Clark]] earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by [[Charles Woodson]] but S [[Aaron Rouse]] batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR [[Anthony Gonzalez]] at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&nbsp;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34\u20137 with about 4:30 remaining in the game.\n\nIn a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to [[Anthony Gonzalez]] at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to [[Dallas Clark]] and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1-yard line. RB [[Dominic Rhodes]] rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34\u201314.\n\nThe Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by [[Charles Woodson]]. [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] rushed for 9&nbsp;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two [[Aaron Rodgers]] kneel downs sealed the dominating victory.\n\nWith the win, the [[Green Bay Packers]] improved their record to 4\u20133 going into the bye week.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Week 9===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Packers\n|V1= 0|V2= 10|V3=3 |V4=3 |VOT=0\n|Host=Titans\n|H1=3 |H2=10 |H3=3 |H4=0 |HOT=3\n|Date=November 2\n|Location=[[LP Field]], [[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n|StartTime=1:00 p.m.\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=69,143\n|Weather=Sunny, 69\u00b0F\n|Referee=[[Bill Leavy]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kenny Albert]], [[Daryl Johnston]], and [[Tony Siragusa]]\n|TVStation=[[NFL on Fox|Fox]]\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n[[File:Derrick-Frost-TitansvsPackers-Nov-2-08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Derrick Frost]] punts at Tennessee, week 9]]\nComing off their bye week, the Packers flew to [[LP Field]] for a Week 9 interconference duel with the unbeaten [[Tennessee Titans]].

Little did New England know that they would be a test for an offensive formation concocted as the Dolphins coaching staff wanted to put running backs [[Ricky Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]] onto the field at the same time.

The siege was fought at the same time as the [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Battle of Boulogne]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May), German units were held back to be ready to resist a resumption of the counter-attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}}, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}} was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 a.m.}} on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May.}}\n\nBy the time that the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] was ready to attack Calais, the  British [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]] and [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR) had reinforced the French and British troops in the port. On 22 May, the British troops had established roadblocks outside the town and French rearguards skirmished with German armoured units, as they advanced towards Calais. British tanks and infantry had been ordered south to reinforce Boulogne but were too late. They then received orders to escort a food convoy to Dunkirk but found the road blocked by German troops. On 23 May, the British began to retire to the old Calais walls (built in the 1670s) and on 24 May, the siege began. The attacks by the 10th Panzer Division were mostly costly failures and by evening, the Germans reported that about half their tanks had been knocked out and a third of the infantry were casualties. The German attacks were supported by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}}, while the Allied defenders were supported by their navies delivering supplies, evacuating wounded and bombarding German targets around the port.\n\nOn the night of {{nowrap|24/25 May,}} the defenders were forced to withdraw from the southern {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, to a line covering the Old Town and [[Citadel of Calais|Citadel]]; attacks next day against this shorter line were repulsed. The Germans tried several times to persuade the garrison to surrender but orders had been received from London to hold out, because an evacuation had been forbidden by the French commander of the northern ports. More German attacks early on 26 May failed and the German commander was given an ultimatum that if Calais was not captured by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.,}} the attackers would be pulled back and the town levelled by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}}. The Anglo-French defences began to collapse in the early afternoon and at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} the order \"every man for himself\" was given to the defenders, as Le Tellier, the French commander surrendered. Next day, small naval craft entered the harbour and lifted about {{nowrap|400 men,}} while aircraft of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm dropped supplies and attacked German artillery emplacements.\n\nIn 1949, Churchill wrote that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk, helping to save the 300,000 soldiers of the BEF, a claim that Guderian contradicted in 1951. In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops to close a gap west of Dunkirk. In 2006, [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had a greater effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real danger was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. Reinforcements sent from Britain to Boulogne and Calais arrived in time to forestall the Germans and hold them off when they advanced again on 22 May.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===Calais===\n[[File:Location Authie and Bresle River-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Topography south of Calais}}]]\nThe term ''[[Channel Ports]]'' refers to [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Dunkirk]] (and sometimes [[Ostend]] in Belgium). The ports are the nearest to [[Cap Gris Nez]], the shortest crossing from England and are the most popular for passenger traffic. Calais is built on low ground with low sand dunes on either side and is enclosed by fortifications. There was a [[Citadel of Calais|citadel]] in the old town surrounded by water and in 1940 on the east side, the moat was still wet but elsewhere had become a dry ditch. Surrounding the town was an {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, a defensive fortification, which originally consisted of twelve [[bastions]] linked by a [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], with a perimeter of {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, built by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] from 1667 to 1707.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\nIn many places, the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} was overlooked by suburban buildings built in the nineteenth century. Two of the southern bastions and the wall linking them had been demolished to make way for railway lines, leading to railway sidings and quays of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} in the harbour. About {{convert|1.6|km|mi|order=flip}} outside the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} to the west was Fort Nieulay. Two other forts to the south and east were derelict or had disappeared.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=80}}{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=220}} Outside the town, low ground to the east and south is cut by ditches, which limit the landward approach to roads raised above ground level. To the west and south-west, there is a ridge of higher ground between Calais and Boulogne, from which Calais is overlooked.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\n===BEF===\nWhen plans for the deployment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) were made, the British [[Imperial General Staff]] drew from experience in the [[First World War]]. The British Expeditionary Force had used the Channel Ports as their {{lang|fr|[[entrep\u00f4t]]}}s for supplies, even though they were only {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Western Front. Had the German [[Spring Offensive]] of 1918 succeeded in breaking through the front and capturing or even threatening the ports, the BEF would have been in a desperate position. During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the BEF had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Calais was used for communication and for troop movements, especially for men granted compassionate leave.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}}\n\n===The Battle of France===\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, [[Army Group A]] ({{lang|de|[[Generaloberst]]}} [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]) broke through the French [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth Army]] (General [[Andr\u00e9 Corap]]) in the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by {{lang|de|[[1st Panzer Army|Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} comprising {{lang|de|[[XIX Armee Korps]]}} under {{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Heinz Guderian]] and the {{lang|de|[[XXXXI Panzer Corps|XLI Armee Korps]]}} ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]). On 20 May, the Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]], cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]], a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=279}} Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the \"Arras halt order\" being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV {{lang|de|Korps}} (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI {{lang|de|Korps}} was moved eastwards, when the corps was only {{convert|50|km|mi|order=flip}} from Dunkirk.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''[[C\u00f4te d'Opale]]''}}]]\nLate on 21 May, {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]}} (OKH)  rescinded the halt order; {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} was to resume the advance and move about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. The next day, Guderian gave orders for the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Rudolf Veiel]]) to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generallautnant}} [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) as a flank guard on the right, advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais; the 1st Panzer Division reaching the vicinity of the port during the late afternoon.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} The [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) was detached to guard against a possible counter-attack from the south. Parts of the 1st Panzer Division and 2nd Panzer Division were also held back to defend bridgeheads on the south bank of the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=288}}{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n{{see also|Battle of Boulogne (1940)#Battle of Boulogne|l1=Battle of Boulogne}}\nCalais had been raided by {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} bombers several times, which caused disruption to military movements, confusion and traffic jams, with refugees making for Calais meeting refugees fleeing the port. The French army units in Calais were commanded by {{lang|fr|[[Commandant]]}} (Major) Raymond Le Tellier and the northernmost bastions and fortifications were manned by French naval reservists and volunteers commanded by the {{lang|de|Commandant du Front de Mer}} (Capitaine de Fregate Carlos de Lambertye). Various army stragglers, including infantry and a machine-gun company had arrived in the town.{{sfnm|1a1=Neave|1y=1972|1p=80|2a1=Sebag-Montefiore|2y=2006|2p=220}} On 19 May, Lieutenant-General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the [[Adjutant General]] of the BEF, appointed Colonel Rupert Holland to command the British troops in Calais and to arrange the evacuation of non-combatant personnel and wounded.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}} The British contingent consisted of a platoon of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] (A&SH) who were guarding a radar site,{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=30}} the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment [[Royal Artillery|RA]], 58th (A&SH) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA and the [[1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|1st Searchlight Regiment RA]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=161}}\n\nWhen the Germans captured Abbeville on 20 May, the [[War Office]] in Britain ordered troops to be despatched to the Channel Ports as a precaution. The [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] was sent to Boulogne. The [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR, Lieutenant-Colonel R. Keller), the 1st Battalion [[Queen Victoria's Rifles]] (QVR, Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. M. Ellison-Macartney), the 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA and the new [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Motor Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Claude Nicholson (British Army)|Claude Nicholson]]), were ordered to Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Most of the units dispatched to Calais were unprepared for action in some respects. The 3rd RTR was part of the [[3rd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Heavy Armoured Brigade]] (Brigadier [[John Crocker]]) and had been about to leave for Cherbourg, to join the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Armoured Division]], which was assembling at [[Pacy-sur-Eure]] in [[Normandy]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} The QVR were a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] motor-cycle battalion, nominally the divisional cavalry for the [[56th (London) Division]]. They had briefly been attached to the 30th Motor Brigade in April but then were returned to the 56th (London) Division for Home Defence, being deprived of their twenty-two scout cars.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=64}} The 30th Motor Brigade had been formed on 24 April 1940, from the 1st Support Group, to take part in the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. After these orders were cancelled, the brigade was posted to [[East Anglia]] to meet a supposed threat of invasion.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=90}} The main body of the brigade were the 1st Battalion, the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]] (1st RB, Lieutenant Colonel [[Chandos Hoskyns (British Soldier)|Chandos Hoskyns]]) and the 2nd Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (2nd KRRC, Lieutenant Colonel [[Euan Miller]]); these were both highly trained units, each about 750 strong.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=89}}\n\nLate on 21 May, the QVR were ordered to proceed by train to Dover to embark for France. All the motor-cycle combinations and other vehicles were to be left behind.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=67}} After a confused move it was realised that there had been a staff error and that there was room for the motor-cycle combinations aboard the {{TSS|Canterbury|1929|6}} but they did not arrive before the ship sailed.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=68}} Lieutenant-Colonel Keller received orders on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May}} at Fordingbridge to move the 3rd RTR to Southampton but during the journey the personnel train was diverted to Dover, while the vehicles continued to Southampton as planned. Keller was briefed at Dover to go to Calais and given sealed orders for the British port commander. The ships carrying the personnel of the 3rd RTR and the QVR departed Dover at {{nowrap|11:00 a.m.}} They arrived at Calais around {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.,}} under a pall of smoke from buildings on fire in the town. The QVR landed without their motorcycles, transport or [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|3-inch mortars]] and only smoke bombs for the [[2-inch mortar]]s. Many of the men were armed only with revolvers and had to scavenge for rifles from those dumped on the quay by personnel hastily departing for England.{{sfn|Neave|1972|pp=65}} The 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA also arrived but in the haste to move, four of the twelve anti-tank guns had to be left behind.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=93}}\n\nWhile they waited for their vehicles to arrive, the men of the 3rd RTR were ordered to disperse in the sand dunes and were bombed soon after. Keller met Holland who told him to take orders from the BEF GHQ but at {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.,}} Brownrigg arrived in Calais and ordered Keller to move the 3rd RTR south-west as soon as it had unloaded, to join the 20th Guards Brigade at Boulogne. After Brownrigg left, Major Ken Bailey turned up from GHQ with orders for the 3rd RTR to go to St. Omer and Hazebrouck, {{convert|29|mi|km|abbr=on}} ''east'' of Boulogne, to make contact with GHQ.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=213\u2013214}} Brownrigg had gone to Dover, unaware that his orders at Calais had been superseded. He met Nicholson and briefed him to relieve Boulogne with the 30th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd RTR.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=162}}\n\nThe ship with the 3rd RTR tanks arrived from Southampton at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} but unloading was very slow, as {{convert|7000|impgal|l|abbr=on}} of petrol had been loaded on deck and had to be moved using only the ship's derricks, as a power cut had immobilised the cranes on the docks. A power cut and a strike by the ship's crew for {{frac|4|1|2}} hours during the night of {{nowrap|22/23 May,}} added to the delay and the captain had intended to leave the harbour without waiting, until he was held up at gunpoint by a 3rd RTR officer.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=214}} The dock workers were exhausted, having been at work unloading rations for the BEF for many hours and it was not until the following morning that the vehicles had been unloaded and refuelled.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=161}} The cruiser tanks had been loaded first and had to be unloaded after everything else. More delay was caused by the tank guns having been coated in a preservative and loaded separately.

In the early afternoon of 23 May, it was unlikely that the British troops on the Calais {{lang|fr|enceinte}} were prepared to receive an attack, the 2nd KRRC and 1st RB having disembarked only an hour earlier at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} The unloading of the 2nd KRRC vehicles was delayed until {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and half of the battalion did not arrive at its positions until {{nowrap|6\u20136:30 p.m.}} An attack on Calais in the early afternoon would only have met the QVR.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=598}}\n\nThe day after Calais surrendered, the first British personnel were evacuated from Dunkirk. In {{lang|de|[[Panzer Leader (book)|Erinnerungen eines Soldaten]]}} (1950, English edition 1952), Guderian replied to a passage in [[The Second World War (book series)|''Their Finest Hour'']] (1949) by Winston Churchill, that Hitler had ordered the panzers to stop outside Dunkirk in the hope that the British would make peace overtures. Guderian denied this and wrote that the defence of Calais was heroic but made no difference to the course of events at Dunkirk.{{sfn|Guderian|1976|p=120}} In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that the defence of Calais and Boulogne diverted three panzer divisions from the French First Army and the BEF; by the time that the Germans had captured the ports and reorganised, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ronald Forbes Adam|Ronald Adam]]) had moved west and blocked the routes to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=168}}\n\nIn 2005, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the Franco-British counter-attack at Arras on 21 May, had a disproportionate effect on the Germans, because the German higher commanders were apprehensive about flank security. [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], the commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} perceived a \"serious threat\" and informed Colonel-General [[Franz Halder]] (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), that he had to wait until the crisis was resolved before continuing. Colonel-General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] commander, ordered the tanks to halt, an order supported by Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A. On 22 May, when the Anglo-French attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} moved on Boulogne and Calais. At {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]}} (OKW, High Command of the Armed Forces) the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order all mobile units to operate either side of Arras and further west; infantry units were to operate to the east of the town.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=287}}\n\nThe crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian, the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast and a race for the channel ports began. Guderian had ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to capture Boulogne, the 1st Panzer Division to take Calais and the 10th Panzer Division to seize Dunkirk, before the halt order. Most of the BEF and the French First Army were still {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} from the coast but despite delays, British troops were sent from England to Boulogne and Calais just in time to forestall the XIX Corps panzer divisions on 22 May. Had the panzers advanced at the same speed on 21 May as they had on 20 May, before the halt order stopped their advance for {{nowrap|24 hours,}} Boulogne and Calais would have fallen easily. (Without a halt at Montcornet on 15 May and the second halt on 21 May, after the Battle of Arras, the final halt order of 24 May would have been irrelevant, because Dunkirk would have already fallen to the 10th Panzer Division.){{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-383-0337-10, Frankreich, Calais, Denkmal vor H\u00e4userruinen.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Calais in ruins after the siege}}]]\nIn 1952, Guderian wrote that the British surrendered at {{nowrap|4:45 p.m.}} and that 20,000 prisoners were taken, including {{nowrap|3,000\u20134,000}} British troops, the remainder being French, Belgian and Dutch, most of whom had been \"locked in cellars by the British\" after they had ceased to fight.{{sfn|Guderian|1976|p=118}} In 2006, Sebag-Montefiore wrote that German casualties killed and wounded during the battle were not recorded but probably amounted to several hundred.

The siege was fought at the same time as the [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Battle of Boulogne]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May), German units were held back to be ready to resist a resumption of the counter-attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}}, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}} was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 a.m.}} on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May.}}\n\nBy the time that the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] was ready to attack Calais, the  British [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]] and [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR) had reinforced the French and British troops in the port. On 22 May, the British troops had established roadblocks outside the town and French rearguards skirmished with German armoured units, as they advanced towards Calais. British tanks and infantry had been ordered south to reinforce Boulogne but were too late. They then received orders to escort a food convoy to Dunkirk but found the road blocked by German troops. On 23 May, the British began to retire to the old Calais walls (built in the 1670s) and on 24 May, the siege began. The attacks by the 10th Panzer Division were mostly costly failures and by evening, the Germans reported that about half their tanks had been knocked out and a third of the infantry were casualties. The German attacks were supported by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}}, while the Allied defenders were supported by their navies delivering supplies, evacuating wounded and bombarding German targets around the port.\n\nOn the night of {{nowrap|24/25 May,}} the defenders were forced to withdraw from the southern {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, to a line covering the Old Town and [[Citadel of Calais|Citadel]]; attacks next day against this shorter line were repulsed. The Germans tried several times to persuade the garrison to surrender but orders had been received from London to hold out, because an evacuation had been forbidden by the French commander of the northern ports. More German attacks early on 26 May failed and the German commander was given an ultimatum that if Calais was not captured by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.,}} the attackers would be pulled back and the town levelled by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}}. The Anglo-French defences began to collapse in the early afternoon and at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} the order \"every man for himself\" was given to the defenders, as Le Tellier, the French commander surrendered. Next day, small naval craft entered the harbour and lifted about {{nowrap|400 men,}} while aircraft of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm dropped supplies and attacked German artillery emplacements.\n\nIn 1949, Churchill wrote that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk, helping to save the 300,000 soldiers of the BEF, a claim that Guderian contradicted in 1951. In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops to close a gap west of Dunkirk. In 2006, [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had a greater effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real danger was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. Reinforcements sent from Britain to Boulogne and Calais arrived in time to forestall the Germans and hold them off when they advanced again on 22 May.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===Calais===\n[[File:Location Authie and Bresle River-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Topography south of Calais}}]]\nThe term ''[[Channel Ports]]'' refers to [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Dunkirk]] (and sometimes [[Ostend]] in Belgium). The ports are the nearest to [[Cap Gris Nez]], the shortest crossing from England and are the most popular for passenger traffic. Calais is built on low ground with low sand dunes on either side and is enclosed by fortifications. There was a [[Citadel of Calais|citadel]] in the old town surrounded by water and in 1940 on the east side, the moat was still wet but elsewhere had become a dry ditch. Surrounding the town was an {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, a defensive fortification, which originally consisted of twelve [[bastions]] linked by a [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], with a perimeter of {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, built by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] from 1667 to 1707.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\nIn many places, the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} was overlooked by suburban buildings built in the nineteenth century. Two of the southern bastions and the wall linking them had been demolished to make way for railway lines, leading to railway sidings and quays of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} in the harbour. About {{convert|1.6|km|mi|order=flip}} outside the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} to the west was Fort Nieulay. Two other forts to the south and east were derelict or had disappeared.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=80}}{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=220}} Outside the town, low ground to the east and south is cut by ditches, which limit the landward approach to roads raised above ground level. To the west and south-west, there is a ridge of higher ground between Calais and Boulogne, from which Calais is overlooked.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\n===BEF===\nWhen plans for the deployment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) were made, the British [[Imperial General Staff]] drew from experience in the [[First World War]]. The British Expeditionary Force had used the Channel Ports as their {{lang|fr|[[entrep\u00f4t]]}}s for supplies, even though they were only {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Western Front. Had the German [[Spring Offensive]] of 1918 succeeded in breaking through the front and capturing or even threatening the ports, the BEF would have been in a desperate position. During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the BEF had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Calais was used for communication and for troop movements, especially for men granted compassionate leave.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}}\n\n===The Battle of France===\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, [[Army Group A]] ({{lang|de|[[Generaloberst]]}} [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]) broke through the French [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth Army]] (General [[Andr\u00e9 Corap]]) in the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by {{lang|de|[[1st Panzer Army|Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} comprising {{lang|de|[[XIX Armee Korps]]}} under {{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Heinz Guderian]] and the {{lang|de|[[XXXXI Panzer Corps|XLI Armee Korps]]}} ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]). On 20 May, the Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]], cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]], a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=279}} Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the \"Arras halt order\" being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV {{lang|de|Korps}} (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI {{lang|de|Korps}} was moved eastwards, when the corps was only {{convert|50|km|mi|order=flip}} from Dunkirk.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''[[C\u00f4te d'Opale]]''}}]]\nLate on 21 May, {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]}} (OKH)  rescinded the halt order; {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} was to resume the advance and move about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais.

The French garrison of Fort Nieulay, outside the western ramparts surrendered after a bombardment. French marines in Fort Lapin and the coastal artillery emplacements spiked the guns and retreated.

The defenders on the ramparts ran short of ammunition and the 229th Battery was reduced to two operational anti-tank guns.

Colonel-General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] commander, ordered the tanks to halt, an order supported by Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A. On 22 May, when the Anglo-French attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} moved on Boulogne and Calais. At {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]}} (OKW, High Command of the Armed Forces) the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order all mobile units to operate either side of Arras and further west; infantry units were to operate to the east of the town.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=287}}\n\nThe crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian, the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast and a race for the channel ports began.
