Clemm was joined in the home by her ailing mother, Elizabeth Cairnes Poe, and her daughter [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]]. Edgar Allan Poe moved in with the family in 1833<ref name=Silverman96/> around the age of 23, after leaving [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Virginia was 10 years old at the time; Poe would marry her three years later, though their only public ceremony was in 1836. Poe lived in the house from about 1833 to 1835.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/arts/edgar-allan-poe-house-in-baltimore-faces-closing.html|title=Fiscal Woe Haunting Baltimore Poe House|date=8 August 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe house was rented using [[pension]] money that Elizabeth collected thanks to her husband, David Poe Sr., who was a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The home is small and Poe's room on the top floor has a ceiling with a sharp pitch which is six feet high at its tallest point.<ref>Haas, Irvin. ''Historic Homes of American Authors''. Washington, DC: The Preservation Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-89133-180-8}}. p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, homes in the area, including Poe's, were set for demolition to make room for the \"Poe Homes\" [[public housing]] project.  The house was saved by the efforts of the [http://www.eapoe.org Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore], which made arrangements with the city of Baltimore and opened the home as [http://www.eapoe.org/balt/poehse.htm The Baltimore Poe House] in 1949. \nFormer displays in the Museum included a lock of Poe's hair, a small piece of Poe's coffin, some original china that once belonged to John Allan (Poe's guardian after [[Eliza Poe]]'s death), and a large reproduction of the portrait of Virginia Clemm painted after her death as well as many other Poe-related images. An original 1849 [[obituary]] by Rufus Griswold in the October 24, 1849 edition of the ''Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper'' is also on display along with a reprint of Poe's original announcement for the creation of a new literary magazine to be called ''[[The Stylus]]'' &mdash; an endeavor that never came to fruition.\n\nThe Museum hosted a number of Poe events throughout the year. It claimed, for example, the largest Poe birthday celebration in the world held every January at the [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]], where Poe was buried following his death in October 1849. In 2009, the curator, Jeff Jerome, planned the biggest event of the Poe Bicentennial at Westminster Hall. He held a third funeral for Poe. Over 1,200 people attended two services.

Initially the size of a [[regiment]], the LSSAH eventually grew into an elite [[military division|division-sized]] unit during [[World War II]].\n\nThe LSSAH participated in combat during the [[invasion of Poland]], and was amalgamated into the [[Waffen-SS]] together with the ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) and the combat units of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV) prior to Operation [[Operation Barbarossa|''Barbarossa'']] in 1941. By mid-1942 it had been increased in size from a regiment to a [[Panzergrenadier]] division and was designated '''SS Panzergrenadier Division \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\"'''. It received its final form as a [[Panzer division]] in October 1943.\n\nMembers of the LSSAH perpetrated numerous atrocities and war crimes, including the [[Malmedy massacre]]. They killed an estimated 5,000 prisoners of war in the period 1940\u20131945, mostly on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Margolian|2000|p=14}}\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early history (1923\u20131933)==\nIn the early days of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of reliable men was needed. [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] formed a guard formation from the ''19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie''; from this formation the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) soon evolved. [[Adolf Hitler]] in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service rather than \"a suspect mass\", such as the SA.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} It was designated the ''Stabswache'' (staff guard).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}} The ''Stabswache'' were issued unique badges, but at this point was still under SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (\"death's head\") as the unit's insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]] who used ''[[Oskar von Hutier|Hutier]]'' [[infiltration tactics]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}\n\nIn May 1923, the unit was renamed ''Sto\u00dftrupp'' (Shock Troop)\u2013Hitler.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} The unit numbered no more than 20 members at that time.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=10, 16}} On 9 November 1923, the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', along with the SA and several other Nazi paramilitary units, took part in the abortive [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]]. In the aftermath, Hitler was imprisoned and his party and all associated formations, including the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', were disbanded.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=62}}\n\n[[File:LSSS AH.svg|thumb|left|upright|The second model of the LSSAH Standard]]\n\nIn the mid-1920s, violence remained a large part of Bavarian politics.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}} Hitler was a potential target. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (protection command).{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}}  The unit was renamed the ''Sturmstaffel'' (assault squadron) and in November was renamed the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', abbreviated to SS.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=26\u201329}} By 1933 the SS had grown from a small bodyguard unit to a formation of over 50,000 men. The decision was made to form a new bodyguard unit, again called the ''Stabswache'', which was mostly made up of men from the [[1st SS-Standarte]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=3}} By 1933 this unit was placed under the command of [[Sepp Dietrich]], who selected 117 men to form the ''SS-Stabswache'' Berlin on 17 March 1933.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} The unit replaced the army guards at the [[Reich Chancellery]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} Out of this initial group, three eventually became divisional commanders, at least eight would become regimental commanders, fifteen became battalion commanders, and over thirty became company commanders in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=1}} Eleven men from the first company of 117 went on to win the Knights Cross, and forty of them were awarded the German Cross in gold for bravery.{{sfn|Johnson|1999|p=15}} Later in 1933, two further training units were formed: ''SS-Sonderkommando Zossen'' on 10 May, and a second unit, designated ''SS-Sonderkommando J\u00fcterbog'' on 8 July.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} These were the only SS units to receive military training at that time. Most of the training staff came from the ranks of the army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} On 3 September 1933 the two ''Sonderkommando'' merged into the ''SS-Sonderkommando Berlin'' under Dietrich's command.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=13}} Most of their duties involved providing outer security for Hitler at his residences, public appearances and guard duty at the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}}\n\nIn November 1933, on the 10th anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch, the ''Sonderkommando'' took part in the rally and memorial service for the NSDAP members who had been killed during the putsch. During the ceremony, the members of the ''Sonderkommando'' swore personal allegiance to Hitler. At the conclusion the unit received the new title, \"''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler''\" (LAH).{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The term ''Leibstandarte'' was derived partly from ''[[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]]'' \u2013 a somewhat archaic German translation of \"Guard of Corps\" or personal bodyguard of a military leader (\"Leib\" = lit. \"body, torso\") \u2013 and ''Standarte'': the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) or ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) term for a regiment-sized unit, also the German word for a specific type of heraldic flag ([[Heraldic flag#Standard|Standard]]).\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17311, Berlin-Lichterfelde, Hitler bei Leibstandarte.jpg|thumb|December 1935 parade for [[Adolf Hitler]] at the LSSAH Barracks. [[Sepp Dietrich]] is on the far right]]\n\nOn 13 April 1934, ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered the ''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler'' (LAH) to be renamed \"''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler''\" (LSSAH). Himmler inserted the SS initials into the name to make it clear that the unit was independent from the SA or army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The LSSAH was considered a \"National Socialist\" unit, which eventually grew into an elite Panzer [[military division|division]] of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=xxv, 12, 18, 58, 202, 203, 285}} Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nDuring 1934, ''[[Stabschef (SA)|Stabschef-SA]]'' Ernst R\u00f6hm continued to push for greater political influence for his already powerful SA. Hitler decided that the SA had to be eliminated as an independent political force and ordered the LSSAH to prepare for the action. The LSSAH formed two companies under the control of [[J\u00fcrgen Wagner]] and Otto Reich, these formations were moved to Munich on 30 June.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}}\n\nHitler ordered all SA leaders to attend a meeting at the Hanselbauer Hotel in [[Bad Wiessee]], near Munich. Hitler along with Sepp Dietrich and a unit from the LSSAH travelled to Bad Wiessee to personally oversee R\u00f6hm's arrest on 30 June. Later at around 17:00 hours, Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the LSSAH to form an \"execution squad\" and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}} There in the prison courtyard, the LSSAH firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=23}} Additional alleged \"traitors\" were shot in Berlin by a unit of the ''Leibstandarte''.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=24}} On 1 July Hitler finally agreed with G\u00f6ring and Himmler that R\u00f6hm should be executed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} In what the Nazis called the R\u00f6hm Putsch, but otherwise came to be known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]], companies of the LSSAH, together with the [[Gestapo]] and G\u00f6ring's ''Landespolizeigruppe'', performed [[Death Squad]] actions. At least 85, but most likely no less than twice that number of people, were executed without trial over the next few days.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=39}}\n\nThis action succeeded in effectively decapitating the SA and removing R\u00f6hm's threat to Hitler's leadership. In recognition of their actions, both the LSSAH and the ''Landespolizeigruppe'' ''General G\u00f6ring'' were expanded to regimental size and motorized. In addition, the SS became an independent organization, no longer part of the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=316}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H15390, Berlin, Kaserne der LSSAH, Vergatterung.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler'' barracks in Berlin, 1938]]\n\nThe LSSAH provided the honor guard at many of the [[Nuremberg Rallies]], and in 1935 took part in the reoccupation of the [[Saarland]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=2}} On 6 June 1935, the LSSAH officially adopted a field-grey uniform to identify itself more with the army, which wore a similar uniform.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=44}} The LSSAH was later in the vanguard of the march into Austria as part of the [[Anschluss]], and in 1938 the unit took part in the occupation of the [[Sudetenland#Sudetenland as part of Nazi Germany|Sudetenland]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=4}} By 1939, the LSSAH was a full infantry regiment with three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and anti-tank, reconnaissance and engineer sub-units.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=4}} Soon after its involvement in the annexation of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], the LSSAH was redesignated ''\"Infanterie-Regiment Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (mot.)\"''. When Hitler ordered the formation of an SS division in mid-1939, the ''Leibstandarte'' was designated to form its own unit, unlike the other ''[[Standarte]]n'' of the ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) (''SS-Standarte Deutschland'', ''SS-Standarte Germania'', and ''SS-Standarte Der F\u00fchrer'').{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=6}} The Polish crisis of August 1939 put these plans on hold, and the LSSAH was ordered to join [[XIII Army Corps (Germany)|XIII. ''Armeekorps'']], a part of [[Army Group South]], which was preparing for the attack on Poland.\n\nThe ''Leibstandarte'' division's symbol was a [[skeleton key]], in honor of its first commander, Josef \"Sepp\" Dietrich (''Dietrich'' is German for skeleton key or [[Lock picking|lock pick]]); it was retained and modified to later serve as the symbol for [[I SS Panzer Corps]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=421}}\n\n==Invasion of Poland==\nDuring the initial stages of the [[invasion of Poland]], the LSSAH was attached to the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|''17.Infanterie-Division'']]{{sfn|Butler|2001|p=23}} and tasked with providing flank protection for the southern pincer. The regiment was involved in several battles against [[Polish cavalry]] brigades attempting to hit the flanks of the German advance. At [[Pabianice]], a town near [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], the LSSAH fought elements of the [[Polish 28th Infantry Division]] and the [[Wo\u0142y\u0144ska Cavalry Brigade]] in close combat.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=157}} Throughout the campaign, the unit was notorious for burning villages.{{sfn|Butler|2001|p=45}} In addition, members of the LSSAH committed atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including the murder of 50 Jews in [[B\u0142onie]] and the massacre of 200 civilians, including children, who were machine gunned in [[Z\u0142oczew]]. Shootings also took place in Boles\u0142awiec, [[Torzeniec]], [[Goworowo]], [[M\u0142awa]], and [[W\u0142oc\u0142awek]].{{sfn|Rossino|2003|pp=114, 159\u2013161}}\n\nAfter the success at Pabianice, the LSSAH was sent to the area near [[Warsaw]] and attached to the [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|''4.Panzer-Division'']] under then ''Generalmajor'' (brigadier general) [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]. The unit saw action preventing encircled Polish units from escaping, and repelling several attempts by other Polish troops to break through. In spite of the swift military victory over Poland, the regular army had reservations about the performance of the LSSAH and SS-VT units due to their higher casualty rate than the army units.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=5}}\n\n==Invasion of France==\nIn early 1940 the LSSAH was expanded into a full independent motorized infantry regiment and a ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' (Assault Gun) battery was added to their establishment.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=6}} The regiment was shifted to the Dutch border for the launch of [[Fall Gelb]]. It was to form the vanguard of the ground advance into the Netherlands, tasked with capturing a vital bridge over the [[IJssel]], attacking the main line of defense at the ''Grebbeberg'' (the Grebbeline), and linking up with the ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' of ''Generaloberst'' [[Kurt Student]]'s airborne forces, the [[German 7th Air Division|''7.Flieger-Division'']] and the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|''22.Luftlande-Infanterie-Division'']].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Weill-059-04, Metz, Heinrich Himmler neben Panzer.jpg|thumb|[[Heinrich Himmler]] inspecting a [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]] of the 1st SS Division, [[Metz]], September 1940]]\n\n''Fall Gelb''\u2014the invasion of France and the Low Countries\u2014was launched on 10 May 1940. On that day, the LSSAH crossed the Dutch border,{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=6}} covered over {{convert|75|km}}, and secured a crossing over the IJssel near [[Zutphen]] after discovering that their target bridge had been destroyed. Over the next four days, the LSSAH covered over {{convert|215|km}}, and upon entering [[Rotterdam]], several of its soldiers accidentally shot at and seriously wounded General Student.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=158}} After the surrender of Rotterdam, the LSSAH left for the [[Hague]], which they reached on 15 May, after capturing 3,500 Dutch soldiers as [[prisoners of war]].{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=154}} After the surrender of the Netherlands on 15 May, the regiment was then moved south to France.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=65}}\n\nAfter the British [[Battle of Arras (1940)|counterattack at Arras]], the LSSAH, along with the [[SS Division Das Reich|''SS-Verf\u00fcgungs-Division'']], were moved to hold the perimeter around [[Dunkirk]] and reduce the size of the pocket containing the encircled [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] and French forces.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=65\u201369}} The LSSAH took up a position 15 miles south west of [[Dunkirk]] along the line of the Aa Canal, facing the Allied defensive line near Watten.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=154}} That night the OKW ordered the advance to halt, with the British Expeditionary Force trapped. The LSSAH paused for the night. However, on the following day of 25 May, in defiance of Hitler's orders, Dietrich ordered his 3rd battalion to cross the canal and take the [[Watten, Nord|Wattenberg]] Heights beyond, where [[United Kingdom|British]] artillery observers were putting the regiment at risk. They assaulted the heights and drove the observers off. Instead of being censured for his act of defiance, Dietrich was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=143, 154}}\n\nOn 26 May the German advance resumed. By 28 May the LSSAH had taken the village of [[Wormhout]], only ten miles from Dunkirk.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=154}} After their surrender, soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]], along with some other units (including [[French Army|French soldiers]]) were taken to a barn in ''La Plaine au Bois'' near [[Wormhout]] and [[Esquelbecq]]. It was there that troops of the LSSAH 2nd battalion, under the command of SS-''Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke]] committed the [[Wormhoudt massacre]], where 80 British and French prisoners of war were killed.{{sfn|Butler|2001|pp=81\u201383}}{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=251\u2013253}} Although it is unarguable that the massacre occurred, Mohnke's level of involvement is impossible to know; he was never formally charged and brought to trial.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=253}}\n\n==Invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece==\n{{Main|Battle of Greece}}\nAfter the conclusion of the Western campaign on 22 June 1940, the LSSAH spent six months in [[Metz]] ([[Moselle]]). It was expanded to brigade size (6,500 men). A 'Flak battalion' and a [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz|StuG]] [[Artillery battery|''Batterie'']] were among the units added to the LSSAH. A new flag was presented by Heinrich Himmler in September 1940.{{sfn|Stein|1984|loc=p. 28, n.7: Ansprache des Reichsf\u00fchrers SS aus Anlass der \u00dcbergabe der F\u00fchrer-standarte an die Leibstandarte 'Adolf Hitler', Metz, Fort Alvensleben, am 7.

After the Luftwaffe's failure in the [[Battle of Britain]] and the cancellation of the planned invasion, the LSSAH was shifted to [[Bulgaria]] in February 1941 in preparation for [[Operation Marita]], part of the planned invasion of [[Greece]] and [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=7}}\n\nThe operation was launched on 6 April 1941 by aerial bombings of central-southern Yugoslavia, specially over Belgrade causing enormous destructions and thousands of victims and woundeds. After the LSSAH entered on 12 April into the Iugoslavian capital, then to follow the route of the [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|9.Panzer-Division]], part of ''General der Panzertruppe'' [[Georg Stumme]]'s [[XL Panzer Corps]]. The LSSAH crossed the border near [[Bitola]] and was soon deep in Greek territory.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-158-0094-33, Balkan, Sp\u00e4hpanzer der Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schwerer Panzersp\u00e4hwagen|Sd.Kfz. 231 armored cars]] of the LSSAH advance into the [[Balkans]]; photo near Sofia, Bulgaria with the Vitosha mountain in the background]]\nThe LSSAH captured [[Vevi]] on 10 April.

An Australian artillery officer wrote of the Germans' \"insolence\" in driving \"trucks down the main road \u2014 to within {{convert|3000|yd}} of our infantry\" and there unloading the troops. The Germans were forced off the road by artillery fire and faced fierce resistance for more than two days. On the morning of 12 April the Germans renewed their attack, and by late afternoon the pass was cleared.{{sfn|Australian Veterans Affairs}}\n\nWith the fall of the two passes the main line of resistance of the [[Epirus Army Section|Greek Epirus army]] was broken, and the campaign became a battle to prevent the escape of the enemy. On 20 April, following a pitched battle in the {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[Metsovon]] Pass in the [[Pindus Mountains]], the commander of the Greek Epirus army surrendered the entire force to Dietrich. British Commonwealth troops were now the only Allied forces remaining in Greece, and they were falling back across the [[Corinth Canal]] to the [[Peloponnesos]]. By 26 April the LSSAH had reached the [[Gulf of Patras]], and in an effort to cut off the retreating British Commonwealth forces, Dietrich ordered that his regiment cross the Gulf and secure the town of [[Patras]] in the Peloponnesos. Since no transport vessels were available, the LSSAH commandeered fishing boats and successfully completed the crossing, but were forced to leave much of their heavy equipment behind. By 30 April the last British Commonwealth troops had either been captured or escaped. The LSSAH occupied a position of honor in the victory parade through [[Athens]]. After Operation Marita, the LSSAH was ordered north to join the forces of [[Army Group South]] massing for the launch of Operation ''[[Operation Barbarossa|Barbarossa]]''.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=8}}\n\n==Invasion of the Soviet Union==\nFollowing LSSAH's outstanding performance during Marita, Himmler ordered that it should be upgraded to divisional status.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=8}} The regiment, already the size of a reinforced brigade, was to be given motorized transport and redesignated \"''SS-Division (mot.)

This meant that the ''SS Panzergrenadier'' divisions were full-strength Panzer divisions in all but name.

On 12 February Waffen-SS troops of the LSSAH occupied the two villages, where retreating Soviet forces had wounded two SS officers. In retaliation, five days later LSSAH troops killed 872 men, women and children. Some 240 of these were burned alive in the church of Yefremovka.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=356-357}}\n\nThe reputation of the \"Blowtorch Battalion\" was confirmed in August 1944, when ''Sturmbannf\u00fchrer'' Jacob Hanreich was captured south of Falaise in France and interrogated by the Allies. He stated that Peiper was \"particularly eager to execute the order to burn villages\". Hanreich had previously served with ''Leibstandarte'' but was with SS Division ''Hitlerjugend'' at the time of his capture.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=354}}\n\nAdditional sources support the division's reputation for brutality. The following statement, taken from the surreptitious recording of POWs' conversations by the Allies, describes the atrocities on the Eastern Front. SS-''Untersturmf\u00fchrer'' Kr\u00e4mer (captured on the Western Front during his service with the SS Division ''Hitlerjugend'') recounted the following from his time with the LSSAH:{{sfn|Neitzel|Welzer|2012|p=309}} \n<blockquote>I have experienced it in Russia at Orel. An MG 42 was set up in the main aisle of a church, [...] and the Russian men, women and children were taken into the church, without knowing at all what was happening. Then they were shot immediately with the MG 42 and petrol was poured on them and the whole place was set on fire.</blockquote>\n\n===Fabrikaktion Operation===\nElements of LSSAH took part in [[Fabrikaktion]] \"factory action\" a/k/a/ ''Gro\u00dfaktion Juden'' \"Major Action (on) Jews\", an operation to capture remaining German Jews that worked in the [[arms industry]]. Men of the LSSAH helped the Gestapo round up Jews in Berlin; people were taken from their jobs and herded in to cattle wagons on 27\u201328 February 1943.

The LSSAH's panzers, advancing in ''[[Panzerkeil]]''s (wedges), soon ran into the elaborate defenses of the Red Army, which slowed the advance. By 9 July, the II SS Panzer Corps had advanced {{convert|48|km|abbr=on}} north, and were nearing the small town of [[Prokhorovka, Belgorod Oblast|Prokhorovka]]. The LSSAH again took the lead; by now its strength was reduced to just 77 armored vehicles. The 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, supported by several tanks, advanced up the road to Prokhorovka against heavy resistance. By midday, the infantry had cleared the Komsomolets State Farm and begun the attack on Hill 241.6, which they secured shortly after nightfall on 10 July.\n\nThe next day the advance resumed, with the division capturing Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2 in heavy fighting against Soviet [[Paratroop]]s of the [[Soviet 9th Guards Airborne Division|9th Guards Airborne Division]]. On 12 July, the Soviets threw the [[5th Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Tank Army]] into a [[Battle of Prokhorovka|counterattack near Prokhorovka]]. Two tank [[corps]] faced the LSSAH, hitting the Germans around Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2. In the ensuing fighting, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. The Soviet counterattack had stalled the German advance, and the division was forced to fall back to Oktiabr'skii. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army lost 300 tanks destroyed and further 300 damaged on 12 July.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Fighting continued the next day, but the focus of the Soviet attack had then shifted to the Totenkopf, on the left of the LSSAH.\n\nWith the battle at Prokhorovka still in the balance, Soviet High Command launched an offensive of their own, [[Operation Kutuzov]], near [[Oryol|Orel]] causing Hitler to order the cessation of Citadel. The II SS Panzer Corps was pulled back. The LSSAH was ordered out of the line, having suffered 2,753 casualties including 474 killed.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=14}} Eleven tanks were also lost during Citadel. The division was sent to Italy to help stabilize the situation there caused by the deposal of [[Benito Mussolini]] by the [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] government and the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] which began on the night of 9\u201310 July 1943.

During this period, the ''Leibstandarte'' was involved in several skirmishes with [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s.

Subsequently the prisoners were shot and their remains found by Allied troops two months later. The soldiers had their fingers cut off, legs broken, and at least one was shot while trying to bandage a comrade's wounds.{{sfn|U.S. Wereth Memorial}}\n\n==Eastern Front 1945==\n{{Main|Operation Spring Awakening}}\n\n[[Operation Spring Awakening]] (6 March 1945 \u2013 16 March 1945) was the last major German offensive launched during World War II. It began in great secrecy on 6 March 1945. The German forces launched attacks in Hungary near [[Lake Balaton]]. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the failed Ardennes Offensive on the Western Front, including the [[6th Panzer Army|6th SS Panzer Army]] and the LSSAH. Operation Spring Awakening was a failure for the German side. Within a week, the early gains were halted by massive counter-attacks by Soviet forces. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, yet Hitler somehow had believed victory was attainable.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=450}}\n\nAfter the failure of Operation Spring Awakening, Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army retreated in stages to the [[Vienna]] area. The Germans prepared defensive positions in an attempt to hold the city against the fast arriving Red Army, in what become known as the [[Vienna Offensive]]. The Germans could not hold Vienna, which fell to the Soviet forces on 13 April.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}}\n\nThis defeat resulted in the ''\u00c4rmelstreifen'' (Cuff Titles Order) or \"armband order\", which was issued by Hitler to the commander of the 6th SS Panzer Army, Sepp Dietrich. Hitler claimed that the troops  \"did not fight as the situation demanded.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}} As a mark of disgrace, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their [[cuff title]]s (German: ''\u00c4rmelstreifen''). Dietrich refused to carry out the order and did not relay the message to the troops.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=238}} According to [[Heinz Guderian]], most cuff titles had already been removed; he later wrote that the removal of unit cuffs from the ''Leibstandarte'', ''Totenkopf'', ''Hohenstaufen'', and the ''Das Reich'' Divisions was accomplished for security reasons.{{sfn|Guderian|1952|p=419}}\n\n===Battle of Berlin===\nPart of the LSSAH ended the war fighting in Berlin. On 23 April 1945, Hitler appointed ''Brigadef\u00fchrer'' Mohnke the commander for the central government district (Zitadelle sector) that included the [[Reich Chancellery]] and ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]''.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=42}} Mohnke's command post was under the Reich Chancellery in the bunkers therein. He formed ''Kampfgruppe'' Mohnke which was divided into two weak regiments made up of approximately 2,000 men.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=287}} The core group were the 800 of the ''Leibstandarte'' Guard Battalion (assigned to guard the F\u00fchrer).{{sfn|Fischer|2008|pp=42\u201343}} After [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's suicide]], they received orders to break out. Prior to the attempt, Mohnke briefed all commanders who could be reached within the Zitadelle sector about Hitler's death and the planned break out.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=49}} It started at 2300 hours on 1 May. Mohnke led the first of ten small groups.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=382}} Several very small groups managed to reach the Americans at the Elbe's west bank, but most, including Mohnke's group, could not get through the Soviet lines. Many were taken prisoner and some committed suicide. On 2 May hostilities officially ended by order of Helmuth Weidling, Commandant of the Berlin Defense Area.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nAfter Vienna was captured, the LSSAH had fewer than 1,600 men and 16 tanks.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=280}} Apart from the remains of Berlin Guard Battalion, the LSSAH surrendered to US forces in the [[Steyr]] area on 8 May 1945.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=182}}\n\n==

Initially the size of a [[regiment]], the LSSAH eventually grew into an elite [[military division|division-sized]] unit during [[World War II]].\n\nThe LSSAH participated in combat during the [[invasion of Poland]], and was amalgamated into the [[Waffen-SS]] together with the ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) and the combat units of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV) prior to Operation [[Operation Barbarossa|''Barbarossa'']] in 1941. By mid-1942 it had been increased in size from a regiment to a [[Panzergrenadier]] division and was designated '''SS Panzergrenadier Division \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\"'''. It received its final form as a [[Panzer division]] in October 1943.\n\nMembers of the LSSAH perpetrated numerous atrocities and war crimes, including the [[Malmedy massacre]]. They killed an estimated 5,000 prisoners of war in the period 1940\u20131945, mostly on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Margolian|2000|p=14}}\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early history (1923\u20131933)==\nIn the early days of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of reliable men was needed. [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] formed a guard formation from the ''19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie''; from this formation the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) soon evolved. [[Adolf Hitler]] in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service rather than \"a suspect mass\", such as the SA.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} It was designated the ''Stabswache'' (staff guard).{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}} The ''Stabswache'' were issued unique badges, but at this point was still under SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (\"death's head\") as the unit's insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]] who used ''[[Oskar von Hutier|Hutier]]'' [[infiltration tactics]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}\n\nIn May 1923, the unit was renamed ''Sto\u00dftrupp'' (Shock Troop)\u2013Hitler.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=16}} The unit numbered no more than 20 members at that time.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=10, 16}} On 9 November 1923, the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', along with the SA and several other Nazi paramilitary units, took part in the abortive [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]]. In the aftermath, Hitler was imprisoned and his party and all associated formations, including the ''Sto\u00dftrupp'', were disbanded.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=62}}\n\n[[File:LSSS AH.svg|thumb|left|upright|The second model of the LSSAH Standard]]\n\nIn the mid-1920s, violence remained a large part of Bavarian politics.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}} Hitler was a potential target. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (protection command).{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=26}}  The unit was renamed the ''Sturmstaffel'' (assault squadron) and in November was renamed the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', abbreviated to SS.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=26\u201329}} By 1933 the SS had grown from a small bodyguard unit to a formation of over 50,000 men. The decision was made to form a new bodyguard unit, again called the ''Stabswache'', which was mostly made up of men from the [[1st SS-Standarte]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=3}} By 1933 this unit was placed under the command of [[Sepp Dietrich]], who selected 117 men to form the ''SS-Stabswache'' Berlin on 17 March 1933.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} The unit replaced the army guards at the [[Reich Chancellery]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=9}} Out of this initial group, three eventually became divisional commanders, at least eight would become regimental commanders, fifteen became battalion commanders, and over thirty became company commanders in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=1}} Eleven men from the first company of 117 went on to win the Knights Cross, and forty of them were awarded the German Cross in gold for bravery.{{sfn|Johnson|1999|p=15}} Later in 1933, two further training units were formed: ''SS-Sonderkommando Zossen'' on 10 May, and a second unit, designated ''SS-Sonderkommando J\u00fcterbog'' on 8 July.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} These were the only SS units to receive military training at that time. Most of the training staff came from the ranks of the army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=11}} On 3 September 1933 the two ''Sonderkommando'' merged into the ''SS-Sonderkommando Berlin'' under Dietrich's command.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=13}} Most of their duties involved providing outer security for Hitler at his residences, public appearances and guard duty at the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=45}}\n\nIn November 1933, on the 10th anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch, the ''Sonderkommando'' took part in the rally and memorial service for the NSDAP members who had been killed during the putsch. During the ceremony, the members of the ''Sonderkommando'' swore personal allegiance to Hitler. At the conclusion the unit received a new title, \"''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler''\" (LAH).{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The term ''Leibstandarte'' was derived partly from ''[[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]]'' \u2013 a somewhat archaic German translation of \"Guard of Corps\" or personal bodyguard of a military leader (\"Leib\" = lit. \"body, torso\") \u2013 and ''Standarte'': the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) or ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) term for a regiment-sized unit, also the German word for a specific type of heraldic flag ([[Heraldic flag#Standard|Standard]]).\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17311, Berlin-Lichterfelde, Hitler bei Leibstandarte.jpg|thumb|December 1935 parade for [[Adolf Hitler]] at the LSSAH Barracks. [[Sepp Dietrich]] is on the far right]]\n\nOn 13 April 1934, ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered the ''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler'' (LAH) to be renamed \"''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler''\" (LSSAH). Himmler inserted the SS initials into the name to make it clear that the unit was independent from the SA or army.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}} The LSSAH was considered a \"National Socialist\" unit, which eventually grew into an elite Panzer [[military division|division]] of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=xxv, 12, 18, 58, 202, 203, 285}} Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nDuring 1934, ''[[Stabschef (SA)|Stabschef-SA]]'' Ernst R\u00f6hm continued to push for greater political influence for his already powerful SA. Hitler decided that the SA had to be eliminated as an independent political force and ordered the LSSAH to prepare for the action. The LSSAH formed two companies under the control of [[J\u00fcrgen Wagner]] and Otto Reich, these formations were moved to Munich on 30 June.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}}\n\nHitler ordered all SA leaders to attend a meeting at the Hanselbauer Hotel in [[Bad Wiessee]], near Munich. Hitler along with Sepp Dietrich and a unit from the LSSAH travelled to Bad Wiessee to personally oversee R\u00f6hm's arrest on 30 June. Later at around 17:00 hours, Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the LSSAH to form an \"execution squad\" and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=22, 23}} There in the prison courtyard, the LSSAH firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=23}} Additional alleged \"traitors\" were shot in Berlin by a unit of the ''Leibstandarte''.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=24}} On 1 July Hitler finally agreed with G\u00f6ring and Himmler that R\u00f6hm should be executed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} In what the Nazis called the R\u00f6hm Putsch, but otherwise came to be known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]], companies of the LSSAH, together with the [[Gestapo]] and G\u00f6ring's ''Landespolizeigruppe'', performed [[Death Squad]] actions. At least 85, but most likely no less than twice that number of people, were executed without trial over the next few days.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=39}}\n\nThis action succeeded in effectively decapitating the SA and removing R\u00f6hm's threat to Hitler's leadership. In recognition of their actions, both the LSSAH and the ''Landespolizeigruppe'' ''General G\u00f6ring'' were expanded to regimental size and motorized. In addition, the SS became an independent organization, no longer part of the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=316}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H15390, Berlin, Kaserne der LSSAH, Vergatterung.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler'' barracks in Berlin, 1938]]\n\nThe LSSAH provided the honor guard at many of the [[Nuremberg Rallies]], and in 1935 took part in the reoccupation of the [[Saarland]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=2}} On 6 June 1935, the LSSAH officially adopted a field-grey uniform to identify itself more with the army, which wore a similar uniform.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=44}} The LSSAH was later in the vanguard of the march into Austria as part of the [[Anschluss]], and in 1938 the unit took part in the occupation of the [[Sudetenland#Sudetenland as part of Nazi Germany|Sudetenland]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=4}} By 1939, the LSSAH was a full infantry regiment with three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and anti-tank, reconnaissance and engineer sub-units.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=4}} Soon after its involvement in the annexation of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], the LSSAH was redesignated ''\"Infanterie-Regiment Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (mot.)\"''. When Hitler ordered the formation of an SS division in mid-1939, the ''Leibstandarte'' was designated to form its own unit, unlike the other ''[[Standarte]]n'' of the ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) (''SS-Standarte Deutschland'', ''SS-Standarte Germania'', and ''SS-Standarte Der F\u00fchrer'').{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=6}} The Polish crisis of August 1939 put these plans on hold, and the LSSAH was ordered to join [[XIII Army Corps (Germany)|XIII. ''Armeekorps'']], a part of [[Army Group South]], which was preparing for the attack on Poland.\n\nThe ''Leibstandarte'' division's symbol was a [[skeleton key]], in honor of its first commander, Josef \"Sepp\" Dietrich (''Dietrich'' is German for skeleton key or [[Lock picking|lock pick]]); it was retained and modified to later serve as the symbol for [[I SS Panzer Corps]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|p=421}}\n\n==Invasion of Poland==\nDuring the initial stages of the [[invasion of Poland]], the LSSAH was attached to the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|''17.Infanterie-Division'']]{{sfn|Butler|2001|p=23}} and tasked with providing flank protection for the southern pincer. The regiment was involved in several battles against [[Polish cavalry]] brigades attempting to hit the flanks of the German advance. At [[Pabianice]], a town near [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], the LSSAH fought elements of the [[Polish 28th Infantry Division]] and the [[Wo\u0142y\u0144ska Cavalry Brigade]] in close combat.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=157}} Throughout the campaign, the unit was notorious for burning villages.{{sfn|Butler|2001|p=45}} In addition, members of the LSSAH committed atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including the murder of 50 Jews in [[B\u0142onie]] and the massacre of 200 civilians, including children, who were machine gunned in [[Z\u0142oczew]]. Shootings also took place in Boles\u0142awiec, [[Torzeniec]], [[Goworowo]], [[M\u0142awa]], and [[W\u0142oc\u0142awek]].{{sfn|Rossino|2003|pp=114, 159\u2013161}}\n\nAfter the success at Pabianice, the LSSAH was sent to the area near [[Warsaw]] and attached to the [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|''4.Panzer-Division'']] under then ''Generalmajor'' (brigadier general) [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]. The unit saw action preventing encircled Polish units from escaping, and repelling several attempts by other Polish troops to break through. In spite of the swift military victory over Poland, the regular army had reservations about the performance of the LSSAH and SS-VT units due to their higher casualty rate than the army units.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=5}}\n\n==Invasion of France==\nIn early 1940 the LSSAH was expanded into a full independent motorized infantry regiment and a ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' (Assault Gun) battery was added to their establishment.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=6}} The regiment was shifted to the Dutch border for the launch of [[Fall Gelb]].

British Commonwealth troops were now the only Allied forces remaining in Greece, and they were falling back across the [[Corinth Canal]] to the [[Peloponnesos]]. By 26 April the LSSAH had reached the [[Gulf of Patras]], and in an effort to cut off the retreating British Commonwealth forces, Dietrich ordered that his regiment cross the Gulf and secure the town of [[Patras]] in the Peloponnesos. Since no transport vessels were available, the LSSAH commandeered fishing boats and successfully completed the crossing, but were forced to leave much of their heavy equipment behind. By 30 April the last British Commonwealth troops had either been captured or escaped. The LSSAH occupied a position of honor in the victory parade through [[Athens]].

SS-''Untersturmf\u00fchrer'' Kr\u00e4mer (captured on the Western Front during his service with the SS Division ''Hitlerjugend'') recounted the following from his time with the LSSAH:{{sfn|Neitzel|Welzer|2012|p=309}} \n<blockquote>I have experienced it in Russia at Orel. An MG 42 was set up in the main aisle of a church, [...] and the Russian men, women and children were taken into the church, without knowing at all what was happening.

Men of the LSSAH helped the Gestapo round up Jews in Berlin; people were taken from their jobs and herded in to cattle wagons on 27\u201328 February 1943.

The LSSAH again took the lead; by now its strength was reduced to just 77 armored vehicles. The 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, supported by several tanks, advanced up the road to Prokhorovka against heavy resistance. By midday, the infantry had cleared the Komsomolets State Farm and begun the attack on Hill 241.6, which they secured shortly after nightfall on 10 July.\n\nThe next day the advance resumed, with the division capturing Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2 in heavy fighting against Soviet [[Paratroop]]s of the [[Soviet 9th Guards Airborne Division|9th Guards Airborne Division]]. On 12 July, the Soviets threw the [[5th Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Tank Army]] into a [[Battle of Prokhorovka|counterattack near Prokhorovka]]. Two tank [[corps]] faced the LSSAH, hitting the Germans around Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2. In the ensuing fighting, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. The Soviet counterattack had stalled the German advance, and the division was forced to fall back to Oktiabr'skii.

The battle group  took part in the fighting to escape the encirclement, forming a part of the spearhead which linked up with the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] near [[Buczacz]] on 6 April.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=16}} The LSSAH Division was reformed in Belgium and was at full strength by 25 April 1944.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=21}}\n\n==Western Front==\nThe division was transferred again as part of the [[I SS Panzer Corps]] which at this time consisted of the 101 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, [[SS Division Hitlerjugend]], [[SS Division G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] and the [[Panzer Lehr Division]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=7}} The LSSAH had been positioned north of the River [[Seine]] to counter any possible landing in the area of the [[Pas de Calais]] so the first units did not arrive in Normandy until after the [[D-Day|Allied invasion]] there on 6 June 1944; part of it arrived on the night of 27\u201328 June with the whole division taking another week.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=131}} By 4 July the I SS Panzer Corps was reformed, and now consisted of the LSSAH and the Hitlerjugend.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=145}} The first action they were involved in was the defense of [[Carpiquet]] village and airfield in the Allied [[Operation Windsor]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=148}} There then followed a number of Allied attacks \u2013  Operations [[Operation Charnwood|Charnwood]] and [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|Jupiter]].

[[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British VIII Corps]], with three armored divisions, launched the attack aiming to seize the German-held Bourgu\u00e9bus Ridge, along with the area between [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]] and [[Vimont, Calvados|Vimont]]. The operation was preceded by a three-hour bombing by 2,500 aircraft.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=174}} The Division strength prior to Goodwood was reported as 59 Panzer IVs, 46 Panthers and 35 StuG IIIs.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=172}}\n\nII/1st SS Panzer Regiment, located near Garcelles, received orders to attack the British at [[Soliers]]. While moving its 13 Panthers towards Bourgu\u00e9bus, the unit engaged 60 British tanks, destroying 20 of them and capturing Soliers. Around 12:00, the Panther Battalion, I/1st SS Panzer regiment, was engaged in combat with the [[British 29th Armoured Brigade]] of the [[British 11th Armoured Division]]. The body of the LSSAH was rushed to the front from [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], where it was being held in reserve. It counterattacked at 17:00, together with the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]], and halted the British offensive on the left front.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=178}}\n\nThe British resumed their assault at around 13:00 on 19 July, having brought up reinforcements to continue the attack. They overran some of the forward German units and approached Bourgu\u00e9bus Ridge at 16:00. They came under fire from Panthers of the ''Leibstandarte'', who had taken up positions on the ridge. Reinforcements of the [[12th SS Panzer Division]] arrived at the right flank at around 15:00. The Canadians attacked next in the [[Battle of Verri\u00e8res Ridge]] and [[Operation Spring]] (see map), where the LSSAH came up against a number of Allied divisions, including the [[Guards Armoured Division]], [[British 7th Armoured Division|7th Armoured]], [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division|2nd]] and [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division|3rd Canadian]] Divisions.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=192}}\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{Main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOn 25 July 1944, US forces under General [[Omar Bradley]] succeeded in breaking through the German defenses as part of [[Operation Cobra]] and entered Brittany.{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=163}}{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=410}} Hitler forbade any retreat, and ordered a counteroffensive, codenamed [[Operation L\u00fcttich]],{{sfn|Lewin|1978|p=38}} by the XLVII Panzer Corps, consisting of the [[2nd Panzer Division]], part of the LSSAH, the [[SS Division Das Reich]] and the [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|116th Panzer Division]].{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=164}} The plan for the attack to hit the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]] east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast.{{sfn |Van der Vat|2003|p=163}} The US response was aided by [[Ultra]] intelligence, which had revealed the plans for Operation L\u00fcttich by 4 August.{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=415}} As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the [[RAF]].{{sfn|D&#39;Este|1984|p=416}}\n\n[[File:St.-Lambert-surrender.jpg|thumb|German soldiers surrender in St. Lambert on 19 August 1944.]]\nThe LSSAH and other divisions went on the attack on 7 August. The 1st SS Panzer Regiment, along with two battalions of motorized infantry, one combat engineer company, and the division's flak battalion, were used for the attack. The weather was not suitable for flying that morning, which disadvantaged the Allies. The SS Division Das Reich recaptured Mortain, and an armored battle group under [[Joachim Peiper]] reached Bourlopin, but had to halt due to US counterattacks and air strikes.\n\nThe much-reduced division was encircled in the [[Falaise pocket]] by US, Canadian, and Polish forces. Some LSSAH units broke out of the pocket on 22 August, leaving behind all their tanks and artillery. The division sustained 5,000 casualties during the Normandy campaign.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|pp=262\u2013264}} During their retreat from France, members of the LSSAH and the SS Division Hitlerjugend division murdered 34 French civilians in the towns of [[Tavaux]] and [[Plomion]].{{sfn|Beevor|2010|p=446}}\n\n===Ardennes Offensive===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge}}\n[[File:Kampfgruppe Knittel's troops on the road to Stavelot.jpg|thumb|Kampfgruppe Knittel's troops on the road to [[Stavelot]] to support Peiper]]\n\nThe Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 \u2013 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive launched through the forested [[Ardennes|Ardennes Mountains region]] of Belgium, France and Luxembourg.. The offensive was called ''Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein'' (Operation \"Watch on the Rhine\") by the Germans. The 'bulge' was the initial incursion the Germans put into the Allies' line of advance, as seen in maps presented in contemporary newspapers.{{sfn|Cole|1965}}{{page needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n[[File:Tiger II La Gleize2008.jpg|thumb|A preserved [[Tiger II]] tank left by the ''Kampfgruppe'' [[Joachim Peiper|Peiper]] at La Gleize in December 1944]]\n[[Wilhelm Mohnke]], now in command of the LSSAH, attached to the [[I SS Panzer Corps]], was the spearhead of the operation.

At 12:30, near the hamlet of Baugnez, on the height halfway between the town of [[Malmedy]] and Ligneuville, Peiper's ''Kampfgruppe'' encountered a convoy of the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], [[7th Armored Division (United States)|US 7th Armored Division]].{{sfn|Cole|1965|p=75}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=216}} After a brief battle the Americans surrendered.

Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper himself was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the killings.{{sfn|Parker|2012|p=278}}\n\nPeiper entered Stavelot on 18 December but encountered fierce resistance from the American defenders. Unable to defeat them, he left a smaller support force in town and headed for the bridge at [[Trois-Ponts]] with the bulk of his strength, but by the time he reached it, retreating US engineers had already destroyed it. Peiper then headed for the village of [[La Gleize]] and from there on to [[Stoumont]]. There, as Peiper approached, engineers blew up the bridge. US defenders were entrenched and ready. Peiper's men were cut off from the main German force and supplies when the Americans recaptured the poorly defended Stavelot on 19 December. As their situation in Stoumont was becoming hopeless, Peiper decided to pull back to La Gleize where he set up his defenses, waiting for the German relief force. Since no such force was able to penetrate the US line, Peiper decided to break out back to the German lines on 23 December. The men of the ''Kampfgruppe'' abandoned their vehicles and heavy equipment, although most of the men were able to escape.\n\nWith each passing day, enemy resistance stiffened and the advance was eventually halted on all fronts. The German High Command ordered that a renewed attack begin on 1 January 1945. Yet by this time, the Allies had regrouped their forces and were ready to repulse any attack launched by the Germans. The operation formally ended on 27 January 1945, and three days later Mohnke was promoted to SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]''. LSSAH and the I SS Panzer Corps were then transferred to Hungary to bolster the crumbling situation there. Mohnke was wounded in an air raid.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=41}} In his place, SS-''Brigadef\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Kumm]] was appointed the new Division Commander as of 15 February 1945.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=41}}\n\n====Killing of Wereth 11====\n{{main|Wereth 11 Massacre}}\n[[File:Wereth 11 Memorial.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|right|Memorial to the ''Wereth 11'']]\nDuring Battle of the Bulge, troops from ''3./SS-PzAA1 LSSAH'' captured eleven African-American soldiers from the [[333rd Artillery Battalion (United States)|333rd Artillery Battalion]] in the hamlet of Wereth. Subsequently the prisoners were shot and their remains found by Allied troops two months later. The soldiers had their fingers cut off, legs broken, and at least one was shot while trying to bandage a comrade's wounds.{{sfn|U.S. Wereth Memorial}}\n\n==Eastern Front 1945==\n{{Main|Operation Spring Awakening}}\n\n[[Operation Spring Awakening]] (6 March 1945 \u2013 16 March 1945) was the last major German offensive launched during World War II. It began in great secrecy on 6 March 1945. The German forces launched attacks in Hungary near [[Lake Balaton]]. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the failed Ardennes Offensive on the Western Front, including the [[6th Panzer Army|6th SS Panzer Army]] and the LSSAH. Operation Spring Awakening was a failure for the German side. Within a week, the early gains were halted by massive counter-attacks by Soviet forces. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, yet Hitler somehow had believed victory was attainable.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=450}}\n\nAfter the failure of Operation Spring Awakening, Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army retreated in stages to the [[Vienna]] area. The Germans prepared defensive positions in an attempt to hold the city against the fast arriving Red Army, in what become known as the [[Vienna Offensive]]. The Germans could not hold Vienna, which fell to the Soviet forces on 13 April.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}}\n\nThis defeat resulted in the ''\u00c4rmelstreifen'' (Cuff Titles Order) or \"armband order\", which was issued by Hitler to the commander of the 6th SS Panzer Army, Sepp Dietrich. Hitler claimed that the troops  \"did not fight as the situation demanded.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}} As a mark of disgrace, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their [[cuff title]]s (German: ''\u00c4rmelstreifen''). Dietrich refused to carry out the order and did not relay the message to the troops.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=238}} According to [[Heinz Guderian]], most cuff titles had already been removed; he later wrote that the removal of unit cuffs from the ''Leibstandarte'', ''Totenkopf'', ''Hohenstaufen'', and the ''Das Reich'' Divisions was accomplished for security reasons.{{sfn|Guderian|1952|p=419}}\n\n===Battle of Berlin===\nPart of the LSSAH ended the war fighting in Berlin. On 23 April 1945, Hitler appointed ''Brigadef\u00fchrer'' Mohnke the commander for the central government district (Zitadelle sector) that included the [[Reich Chancellery]] and ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]''.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=42}} Mohnke's command post was under the Reich Chancellery in the bunkers therein.

Prior to the attempt, Mohnke briefed all commanders who could be reached within the Zitadelle sector about Hitler's death and the planned break out.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|p=49}} It started at 2300 hours on 1 May. Mohnke led the first of ten small groups.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=382}} Several very small groups managed to reach the Americans at the Elbe's west bank, but most, including Mohnke's group, could not get through the Soviet lines. Many were taken prisoner and some committed suicide. On 2 May hostilities officially ended by order of Helmuth Weidling, Commandant of the Berlin Defense Area.{{sfn|Fischer|2008|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nAfter Vienna was captured, the LSSAH had fewer than 1,600 men and 16 tanks.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=280}} Apart from the remains of Berlin Guard Battalion, the LSSAH surrendered to US forces in the [[Steyr]] area on 8 May 1945.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=182}}\n\n==
