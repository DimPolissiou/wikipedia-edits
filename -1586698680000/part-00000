She is the recipient of a [[Golden Globe Award]] and has been nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and four [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nAfter Ryder's film debut in  ''[[Lucas (film)|Lucas]]'' (1986), she gained attention with her performance in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). She further rose to prominence with major roles in ''[[Heathers]]'' (1988), ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'' (1990), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).

[[Michael Schur]] and [[Rashida Jones]] wrote the teleplay for the episode, based on a story by series creator and co-showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]], while [[Joe Wright]] acted as director. It premiered on [[Netflix]] on 21 October 2016, alongside the rest of the third series.\n\nThe episode is set in a world where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their [[socioeconomic status]]. Lacie ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]) is a young woman overly obsessed with her ratings; she finds an opportunity to elevate her ratings greatly and move into a more luxurious residence after being chosen by her popular childhood friend ([[Alice Eve]]) as the maid of honour for her wedding. Her obsession leads to several mishaps on her journey to the wedding that culminate in a rapid reduction in her ratings.\n\nUnder Netflix, the episode was given a much larger budget than the previous episodes of the programme, when it had been under [[Channel 4]]. Brooker wrote an outline for the episode, then Schur wrote the former half of the episode and Jones wrote the latter. Production was undertaken in a manner similar to a short film; \"Nosedive\" was filmed in [[South Africa]], with [[Seamus McGarvey]] as [[director of photography]] and Joel Collins and James Foster as the [[production designers]]. The tone of the episode is less bleak and more comedic than other ''Black Mirror'' episodes, with the ending significantly more positive than in episodes of the programme's prior two series.\n\nThe episode received mainly positive reviews and is middling in critics' lists of ''Black Mirror'' episodes, qualitatively. The pastel visual aesthetics were widely praised, along with [[Max Richter]]'s soundtrack and Howard's performance. A criticism from several reviewers was the episode's predictability and ending, though the script and comedic undertones were praised by some. Many critics noted the similarity of the episode to real world app [[Peeple (mobile application)|Peeple]] and China's upcoming [[Social Credit System]], along with fictional works about social media with themes of gender and obsession with image. The episode was nominated for several awards, including a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination for Howard and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for McGarvey. A board game ''Nosedive'', based on the episode, was released in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nSociety has embraced a technology wherein everyone shares their daily activities through eye implants and mobile devices and rates their interactions with others on a scale of one to five stars, cumulatively affecting everyone's [[socioeconomic status]].\n\nLacie Pound ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]) seeks to raise her 4.2 rating to 4.5 for a discount on a luxury apartment; however, despite her attempts to be an outgoing and pleasant socialite, her rating has plateaued. Lacie talks to a consultant who suggests gaining favour from very highly-rated people. Lacie uploads a photograph of Mr. Rags, a ragdoll that she and her childhood friend Naomi ([[Alice Eve]]) made together. Naomi, who is currently rated 4.8, rates the photo five stars and calls Lacie, saying that she is engaged and inviting Lacie to deliver a speech as the maid of honour. Lacie agrees and commits on the apartment, anticipating many high ratings from the guests.\n\nOn the day of her flight, several mishaps cause people to rate Lacie negatively, dropping her rating below 4.2. At the airport, her flight is cancelled and she cannot buy a seat with her current rating. When Lacie causes a scene, security penalizes her by subtracting a full point for 24 hours. Because of her low rating, Lacie can only rent an older car to drive to the wedding, which she cannot recharge when it runs out of power. She is forced to hitchhike with Susan ([[Cherry Jones]]), a truck driver rated below 2.0. Susan tells Lacie that she used to care about her rating until her late husband was passed over for vital cancer treatment because their scores were deemed not high enough; she says she feels much freer without obsessing over ratings.\n\nThe next day, while Lacie is en route to the wedding, Naomi tells her to not come, as her severely reduced rating will negatively impact Naomi's own ratings. Enraged, Lacie reaches the wedding and sneaks in during the reception. She grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written but becomes more and more upset, finally grabbing a knife and threatening to behead Mr. Rags. The guests rate Lacie negatively, causing her rating to fall below one star. Security arrives and arrests Lacie. She is taken to prison, and the technology supporting the rating system is removed from her eyes. She and the man in the cell opposite hers ([[Sope Dirisu]]) realise they can now speak without worrying about being rated, and gleefully hurl insults at each other.\n\n==Production==\n{{external media\n|video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDiYGjp5iFg Black Mirror \u2013 Season 3]<br>The trailer for series three of ''Black Mirror''.\n|video2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R32qWdOWrTo Black Mirror \u2013 Nosedive Featurette]<br>Brief commentary by Charlie Brooker and Bryce Dallas Howard.\n}}\n\"Nosedive\" is the first episode of the third series of ''Black Mirror''; all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016.

Schur was also a fan of ''Black Mirror'' and Rashida Jones suggested that they could co-write the episode. With Jones and Schur on board, the main character changed from someone focused on playing the ratings system to a people-pleaser, the work presentation was changed to a wedding and the idea of Lacie having a childhood talisman was introduced. Lacie's brother was originally an ex-boyfriend.<ref name=\"ibm\"/> Schur wrote the first half of the episode (up to Lacie beginning her travel in a rented car), while Rashida Jones wrote the second half, and the two then combined their scripts.<ref name=\"avclub interview\"/> In the initial draft, the episode ended with Lacie's work presentation going viral and her achieving fame.

Betancourt says that historically, women have been portrayed as victims of technology, a pattern which these works fit. For instance, Ingrid and Lacie are both obsessed with coming across as perfect online. In contrast, male characters are traditionally the voice of reason: in these works, Lacie's brother Ryan, Mercer (''The Circle'') and Taylor's husband (''Ingrid Goes West'') serve this purpose.<ref name=\"pacific\"/> Furthermore, the androgyny of \"Nosedive\" character Susan is linked to her disdain for social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailytitan.com/2017/04/female-gaze-black-mirror-explores-gendered-expectations-social-media/|title=The Female Gaze: 'Black Mirror' explores the gendered expectations of social media|work=[[The Daily Titan]]|last=Casas|first=Darlene|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> Betancourt writes that these characterisations do not accord with research on how men and women use technology, where some studies report that men have more emotional investment in positive feedback on social media.

They tactically assign them to stacks and then each player selects a stack. In the Experience phase, players assign each other experiences such as \"Receiving an anonymous hate cake\" and each player then rates their received experiences from one to five stars.

[[Michael Schur]] and [[Rashida Jones]] wrote the teleplay for the episode, based on a story by series creator and co-showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]], while [[Joe Wright]] acted as director. It premiered on [[Netflix]] on 21 October 2016, alongside the rest of the third series.\n\nThe episode is set in a world where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their [[socioeconomic status]]. Lacie ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]) is a young woman overly obsessed with her ratings; she finds an opportunity to elevate her ratings greatly and move into a more luxurious residence after being chosen by her popular childhood friend ([[Alice Eve]]) as the maid of honour for her wedding. Her obsession leads to several mishaps on her journey to the wedding that culminate in a rapid reduction in her ratings.\n\nUnder Netflix, the episode was given a much larger budget than the previous episodes of the programme, when it had been under [[Channel 4]]. Brooker wrote an outline for the episode, then Schur wrote the former half of the episode and Jones wrote the latter. Production was undertaken in a manner similar to a short film; \"Nosedive\" was filmed in [[South Africa]], with [[Seamus McGarvey]] as [[director of photography]] and Joel Collins and James Foster as the [[production designers]]. The tone of the episode is less bleak and more comedic than other ''Black Mirror'' episodes, with the ending significantly more positive than in episodes of the programme's prior two series.\n\nThe episode received mainly positive reviews and is middling in critics' lists of ''Black Mirror'' episodes, qualitatively. The pastel visual aesthetics were widely praised, along with [[Max Richter]]'s soundtrack and Howard's performance. A criticism from several reviewers was the episode's predictability and ending, though the script and comedic undertones were praised by some. Many critics noted the similarity of the episode to real world app [[Peeple (mobile application)|Peeple]] and China's upcoming [[Social Credit System]], along with fictional works about social media with themes of gender and obsession with image. The episode was nominated for several awards, including a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination for Howard and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for McGarvey. A board game ''Nosedive'', based on the episode, was released in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nSociety has embraced a technology wherein everyone shares their daily activities through eye implants and mobile devices and rates their interactions with others on a scale of one to five stars, cumulatively affecting everyone's [[socioeconomic status]].\n\nLacie Pound ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]) seeks to raise her 4.2 rating to 4.5 for a discount on a luxury apartment; however, despite her attempts to be an outgoing and pleasant socialite, her rating has plateaued. Lacie talks to a consultant who suggests gaining favour from very highly-rated people. Lacie uploads a photograph of Mr. Rags, a ragdoll that she and her childhood friend Naomi ([[Alice Eve]]) made together. Naomi, who is currently rated 4.8, rates the photo five stars and calls Lacie, saying that she is engaged and inviting Lacie to deliver a speech as the maid of honour. Lacie agrees and commits on the apartment, anticipating many high ratings from the guests.\n\nOn the day of her flight, several mishaps cause people to rate Lacie negatively, dropping her rating below 4.2. At the airport, her flight is cancelled and she cannot buy a seat with her current rating. When Lacie causes a scene, security penalizes her by subtracting a full point for 24 hours. Because of her low rating, Lacie can only rent an older car to drive to the wedding, which she cannot recharge when it runs out of power. She is forced to hitchhike with Susan ([[Cherry Jones]]), a truck driver rated below 2.0. Susan tells Lacie that she used to care about her rating until her late husband was passed over for vital cancer treatment because their scores were deemed not high enough; she says she feels much freer without obsessing over ratings.\n\nThe next day, while Lacie is en route to the wedding, Naomi tells her to not come, as her severely reduced rating will negatively impact Naomi's own ratings. Enraged, Lacie reaches the wedding and sneaks in during the reception. She grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written but becomes more and more upset, finally grabbing a knife and threatening to behead Mr. Rags. The guests rate Lacie negatively, causing her rating to fall below one star. Security arrives and arrests Lacie. She is taken to prison, and the technology supporting the rating system is removed from her eyes. She and the man in the cell opposite hers ([[Sope Dirisu]]) realise they can now speak without worrying about being rated, and gleefully hurl insults at each other.\n\n==Production==\n{{external media\n|video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDiYGjp5iFg Black Mirror \u2013 Season 3]<br>The trailer for series three of ''Black Mirror''.\n|video2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R32qWdOWrTo Black Mirror \u2013 Nosedive Featurette]<br>Brief commentary by Charlie Brooker and Bryce Dallas Howard.\n}}\n\"Nosedive\" is the first episode of the third series of ''Black Mirror''; all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016.

Betancourt says that historically, women have been portrayed as victims of technology, a pattern which these works fit. For instance, Ingrid and Lacie are both obsessed with coming across as perfect online. In contrast, male characters are traditionally the voice of reason: in these works, Lacie's brother Ryan, Mercer (''The Circle'') and Taylor's husband (''Ingrid Goes West'') serve this purpose.<ref name=\"pacific\"/> Furthermore, the androgyny of \"Nosedive\" character Susan is linked to her disdain for social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailytitan.com/2017/04/female-gaze-black-mirror-explores-gendered-expectations-social-media/|title=The Female Gaze: 'Black Mirror' explores the gendered expectations of social media|work=[[The Daily Titan]]|last=Casas|first=Darlene|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> Betancourt writes that these characterisations do not accord with research on how men and women use technology, where some studies report that men have more emotional investment in positive feedback on social media.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} north of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]] in the centre of the parish, Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/>\n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch \u2013 the latter made from reeds from the banks of the Tay. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what there were six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref> On an [[Ordnance Survey]] map of 1861, a \"mill dam\" is shown southeast of the settlement, towards today's Guardswell Farm.<ref>[https://i0.wp.com/holeousia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pitmiddle-village-1861.jpg?ssl=1 Ordnance Survey map, 1861]</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.
