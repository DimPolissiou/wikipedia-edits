Cedar Mills Lake was first referred to on old maps by the explorers, Fremont and Nicollet.  The lake had the Indian name of \u201cRanti-tia-wita\u201d or \u201c Island of the Red Cedar\u201d.  Daniel A. Cross was the first to make a settlement there with his family in 1856. He was later killed during the Sioux Uprising of 1862.  In 1857, R. J. Brodwell, O. S. Merriam, Philander Ball, George R. Jewett, Elmer Eighmey, and a few others settled there.  George Nichols built a flour mill there in 1858 and he ran it until 1867.  The first store was established in the town by J. D. Baldwin.  The first school was taught by Sophia Pratt in 1860, in the home of Daniel Cross.  In September 1862, a small group of the Hutchinson Guards left the Hutchinson stockade and went to Meeker County in search of Caleb Sanborn and other missing settlers. Some of the Guard were Daniel Cross, T. R. Webb, Lieutenant Oliver Pierce, and Frank Jewett.  When the party reached the north side of Cedar Lake woods, they were suddenly ambushed by thirteen Indians. Daniel Cross was shot and killed instantly. The search party had no time to pick up Cross's body as they were running to escape.\n\nThe Indians quickly scalped Daniel Cross, put his scalp on a pole, and carried it as a battle flag while they chased the men who were fleeing. T.R. Webb ran to Cedar Lake, jumped in a small boat, and paddled his way to Cedar Island where he hid for the night. Webb returned to Hutchinson the next morning. The remaining men also made it to Hutchinson safely. The next day a group of men went out to find the bodies of Cross and Sanborn, which had been badly mutilated, and they brought them back to Hutchinson.\n\nHere's another Sioux Uprising story that involved Cedar Mills.  On Monday morning, August 18, 1862, Henry J. Lasher learned of the massacre at Acton, and he sent his family to his wife's brother-in-law, D. B. Peck, who lived nearby.  Lasher set out to notify the settlers in Greenleaf of the attacks.  He found the settlers had already gone, so he made his way back to Peck's. Henry sent his family back to his farm and he stayed to help Peck harvest.  On Thursday, he heard gunfire coming from near his farm and so he went to Cedar Mills to get someone to accompany him back to his farm to see if his family was all right.  No one would go to help him, so Henry went alone.  On reaching his farm, he met a group of about twenty people who had left Forest City to come and bury those killed at Acton.\n\nLasher and his family returned to Cedar Mills, and Peck, with his team of horses, hauled 1,600 pounds of flour and other provisions from his farm to Henry's. When they arrived at Henry's farm, they found some eight or ten families had gathered from the surrounding country, all bent on fleeing for safety.  After some talk, it was decided to build a \u201cfort\u201d and remain.   Henry was appointed captain, and they decided to fortify \u201cthe Point\u201d in Cedar Lake and remain there until the uprising was over. Weymouth and Lasher stood guard at the crossing by the Cedar Lake mill.  On Wednesday, a party of thirty or forty refugees from Yellow Medicine County turned up, accompanied by a friendly Indian named John Other Day.\n\nWith the refugees who arrived at Cedar Lake with Other Day was Stuart B. Garvie, who had been wounded by buck-shot in the lower abdomen. Garvie died the following day, August 22, in Lasher's house.  An Indian named Haypinkpa or \u201cTip of the Horn\u201d was tried, convicted of the murder of Garvie, and hung in Mankato in the mass hangings.\n\nA post office called Cedar Mills was established in 1860 with Charles G. Topping as the postmaster.  In 1861, Henry J. Lasher became the postmaster and during the Sioux Uprising he buried all the official papers and for years there was no post office in Cedar Mills.  In 1870, it was established again but it closed in 1955.  The town itself wasn't organized until January 25, 1870.  Both Cedar Mills and Cosmos are located on the South Fork of the Crow River which empties into the Mississippi by Dayton, Minnesota.  It drains one of the largest watersheds (over 200 square miles) in central Minnesota.  In the 2010 census, 45 people were found to be living in Cedar Mills.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?task=display&state=MN&county=Meeker | title=Meeker County | publisher=Jim Forte Postal History | accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.34|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nMinnesota State Highways [[Minnesota State Highway 7|7]] and [[Minnesota State Highway 22|22]] are two of the main routes in the community.

The next day a group of men went out to find the bodies of Cross and Sanborn, which had been badly mutilated, and they brought them back to Hutchinson.\n\nHere\u2019s another Sioux Uprising story that involved Cedar Mills.  On Monday morning, August 18, 1862, Henry J. Lasher learned of the massacre at Acton, and he sent his family to his wife\u2019s brother-in-law, D. B. Peck, who lived nearby.  Lasher set out to notify the settlers in Greenleaf of the attacks.  He found the settlers had already gone, so he made his way back to Peck\u2019s.

Weymouth and Lasher stood guard at the crossing by the Cedar Lake mill.  On Wednesday, a party of thirty or forty refugees from Yellow Medicine County turned up, accompanied by a friendly Indian named John Other Day.\n\nWith the refugees who arrived at Cedar Lake with Other Day was Stuart B. Garvie, who had been wounded by buck-shot in the lower abdomen. Garvie died the following day, August 22, in Lasher\u2019s house.  An Indian named Haypinkpa or \u201cTip of the Horn\u201d was tried, convicted of the murder of Garvie, and hung in Mankato in the mass hangings.\n\nA post office called Cedar Mills was established in 1860 with Charles G.

The Battalion was stationed in [[Belfast]] from 5 July 1973 to 31 October 1973. The Grenadiers were given responsibility first for the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Shankill Road]] area and the predominantly Catholic [[Ardoyne]] area. This was a time of high tension and regular contacts with paramilitaries. Ostensibly, the battalion's main objectives were to search for weapons and to find paramilitaries. Nairac was frequently involved in such activity on the streets of Belfast, and was a community relations activist at the Ardoyne sports club. The battalion's tour was adjudged a success with 58 weapons, 9,000 rounds of ammunition and 693&nbsp;lbs of explosives taken and 104 men jailed. The battalion had no casualties and did not shoot anyone. After his tour had ended he stayed on as liaison officer for the replacement battalion, the 1st Battalion of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]].  On their first patrol, Nairac narrowly avoided the impact of the explosion of a [[car bomb]] on the [[Crumlin Road]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Parker | first = John  | title = Secret Hero | publisher = Metro| year=  2004 | pages =21\u201331 | month = | isbn = 1-84358-100-0}}</ref>\n\nRather than returning to his battalion, which was being transferred to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], Nairac volunteered for [[military intelligence]] duties in Northern Ireland.

Posted to South [[County Armagh]], 4 Field Survey Troop was given the task of performing surveillance duties.

The Battalion was stationed in [[Belfast]] from 5 July 1973 to 31 October 1973. The Grenadiers were given responsibility first for the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Shankill Road]] area and the predominantly Catholic [[Ardoyne]] area. This was a time of high tension and regular contacts with paramilitaries. Ostensibly, the battalion's main objectives were to search for weapons and to find paramilitaries. Nairac was frequently involved in such activity on the streets of Belfast, and was a community relations activist at the Ardoyne sports club. The battalion's tour was adjudged a success with 58 weapons, 9,000 rounds of ammunition and 693&nbsp;lbs of explosives taken and 104 men jailed. The battalion had no casualties and did not shoot anyone. After his tour had ended he stayed on as liaison officer for the replacement battalion, the 1st Battalion of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]].  On their first patrol, Nairac narrowly avoided the impact of the explosion of a [[car bomb]] on the [[Crumlin Road]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Parker | first = John  | title = Secret Hero | publisher = Metro| year=  2004 | pages =21\u201331 | month = | isbn = 1-84358-100-0}}</ref>\n\nRather than returning to his battalion, which was being transferred to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], Nairac volunteered for [[military intelligence]] duties in Northern Ireland. Following completion of several training courses, he returned to Northern Ireland in 1974, attached to 4 Field Survey Troop, [[Royal Engineers]], one of the three sub-units of a Special Duties unit known as [[14 Intelligence Company]] (14 Int). Posted to South [[County Armagh]], 4 Field Survey Troop was given the task of performing surveillance duties. Nairac was the liaison officer for the unit, the local British Army brigade and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC).<ref>{{cite book | last = Parker | first = John | title = Secret Hero | publisher = Metro| year=  2004 | pages =32\u201366 | month = | isbn = 1-84358-100-0 }}</ref>\n\nHe assumed duties outside his official jurisdiction as a liaison officer, including undercover operations.

The narrator states:\n\n{{Quote|We have evidence from police, military and loyalist sources which confirms the links between Nairac and the [[Portadown]] loyalist paramilitaries. And also that in May 1974, he was meeting with these paramilitaries, supplying them with arms and helping them plan acts of terrorism against republican targets. In particular, the three prime Dublin [bomb attacks] suspects, [[Robert McConnell (loyalist)|Robert McConnell]], [[Harris Boyle]] and the man called 'The Jackal' ([[Robin Jackson]], [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] [UVF] member from Lurgan), were run before and after the Dublin bombings by Captain Nairac.}}\n\nAccording to the documentary, support for this allegation was said to have come from various sources:\n\n{{Quote|They include officers from [[RUC Special Branch]], [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] and [[Special Patrol Group (RUC)|Special Patrol Group]]; officers from the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda\u00ed]] [[Special Detective Unit|Special Branch]]; and key senior loyalists who were in charge of the [[County Armagh]] paramilitaries of the day....}}\n\nGeoff Knupfer of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains stated that Nairac was in [[Ashford, Kent]], England at the time of the bombings.<ref name=\"it\"/>\n\n===Holroyd===\nIt was alleged by a former [[Secret Intelligence Service]] operative, [[Captain Fred Holroyd]], that Nairac admitted involvement in the assassination of IRA member [[John Francis Green]] on 10 January 1975 to him. Holroyd claimed in a ''[[New Statesman]]'' article written by [[Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] that Nairac had boasted about Green's death and showed him a colour [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photograph of Green's corpse taken directly after his assassination.<ref>Rolston, Bill and Gilmartin, Mairead: ''Unfinished business: state killings and the quest for truth''. Beyond the Pale Publications, p. 34. {{ISBN|1-900960-09-5}}</ref>\n\nThese claims were given prominence when, in 1987, [[Ken Livingstone]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] told the House of Commons that Nairac was quite likely to have been the person who organised [[Miami Showband killings|the killing of three Miami Showband musicians]].<ref>Livingstone, Ken ''You Can't Say That'' pp 294\u20135</ref>\n\nThe Barron Report stated that:{{quote|The evidence before the Inquiry that the polaroid photograph allegedly taken by the killers after the murder was actually taken by a Garda officer on the following morning seriously undermines the evidence that Nairac himself had been involved in the shooting.}}\n\nHolroyd's evidence was also questioned by Barron in the following terms: {{quote|The picture derived from this is of a man increasingly frustrated with the failure of the British Authorities to take his claims seriously; who saw the threat to reveal a crossborder SAS assassination as perhaps his only remaining weapon in the fight to secure a proper review of his own case.

In 1856, a [[tornado]] swept through the town killing nine people and destroying most of its buildings. The seat of the county was moved to Dallas not long after.\n\n==History==\nCedar Hill was founded around 1846 by a small group of settlers from the [[Peters Colony]].  They came from Kentucky, Alabama, and surrounding areas to arrive in the Dallas area of North Texas.  197 families and 184 single men settled in what is now Cedar Hill, making it the largest settlement in the area at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://cedarhillmuseum.com/history/|website=Cedar Hill Museum of History}}</ref>\n\nCedar Hill currently has 5 homes listed on the [[National Park Service]]\u2019s National Register of Historic Places,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/|website=National Park Service}}</ref> 4 historical structures on the [[Texas Historical Commission]]\u2019s list of Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, and 2 graveyards designated as \u201cHistorical Texas Cemeteries\u201d by the Texas Historical Commission, one of which is believed to be the oldest integrated cemetery in Dallas County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks|url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/preserve/projects-and-programs/recorded-texas-historic-landmarks|website=Texas Historical Commission}}</ref>\n\n===1856 Tornado===\nOn April 29, 1856, Cedar Hill was struck by a tornado that claimed at least nine lives, damaged property, killed livestock, and reportedly left only two structures standing.  Among the survivors was teacher and pastor, Robert Crawford.  Crawford donated four acres of his land to church trustees to be designated as a free and indiscriminate public graveyard.  Nine victims of the tornado were buried on Crawford's land.<ref>{{cite web|title=More History|url=http://cedarhillmuseum.com/history/more-history/|website=Cedar Hill Museum of History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Crawford's Tornado Graveyard|url=http://cedarhilltx.com/1727/Crawfords-Tornado-Graveyard|website=cedarhilltx.com}}</ref>\n\nThe graveyard lay lost for about 100 years. It was rediscovered and certified by the Texas Historical Commission in 2006, and was named the Crawford Tornado Graveyard.  The graveyard was reconsecrated in a blessing ceremony<ref>{{cite web|title=Graveyard Blessing|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbQR1AEaZ7w|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=11 July 2016|date=29 March 2012}}</ref> on October 7, 2011.

An economic development advisory committee was formed by the city council that surveyed the residents to see how they envisioned Cedar Hill's future. Based on the response, subcommittees were formed to look into funding, asset enhancement, and community image.\n\nIn January 1994 voters approved a special sales tax to fund the economic development efforts, and the Cedar Hill EDC was incorporated in September 1994. They began with an annual budget of $150,000, and have increased it to $3.5 million with their development efforts.  The economic development corporation has been a huge proponent in development activity in the City, assisting with recruiting and retaining businesses.\n\nSince 2000, the city has added several retail outlets. The opening of The Plaza at Cedar Hill, in the fall of 2000, began the growth. This {{convert|260000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} retail center included a variety of large and small stores, including [[Pier 1 Imports]], [[Macaroni Grill]], David's Seafood, [[Chili's]], [[Hobby Lobby]] and [[OfficeMax]].

Restaurants nearby include [[Joe's Crab Shack]], [[Saltgrass Steak House]] and [[Panera Bread]]. A couple of years later, Cedar Hill Pointe was built, which opened in 2005, with [[Best Buy]], Rooms to Go Beds, [[Wolf Camera]] and other retail stores.\n\n[[Hillside Village]] (formerly Uptown Village at Cedar Hill), Cedar Hill's upscale lifestyle center, opened in March 2008. The {{convert|615000|sqft|adj=on}} lifestyle shopping center includes three [[anchor store]]s ([[Dillard's]], [[Barnes & Noble]], and [[Dick's Sporting Goods]]), 65 additional stores, and numerous restaurants.

The park consists of 1,826 acres of land and miles of shoreline.<ref name=\"Cedar Hill State Park History\">{{cite web|title=Cedar Hill State Park History|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/cedar-hill/cedar-hill-state-park-history|website=Texas Parks & Wildlife}}</ref>  The area is a transition zone between the rolling [[tallgrass prairie]] with its black clay soil and the rugged [[Austin Chalk|limestone escarpment]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interpretive Guido to Cedar Hill State Park and Penn Farm Agricultural History Center|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_br_p4503_0131o.pdf|website=Texas Parks & Wildlife}}</ref>\n\nThe park considers the native tallgrass prairie remnants to be its most important natural feature.  In the early 1800s a vast tallgrass prairie stretched from Texas to Canada.  Today, less than one percent survives.  These endangered remnants include [[Indian Grass|Indian grass]], [[Little Bluestem|little bluestem]], [[big bluestem]], [[sideoats grama]], and [[switchgrass]].  The park has reintroduced [[Eastern gamagrass|Eastern gamma grass]] and [[Meadow Pink|meadow pinks]] in selected areas.<ref name=\"Cedar Hill State Park Nature\">{{cite web|title=Cedar Hill State Park Nature|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/cedar-hill/nature|website=Texas Parks & Wildlife}}</ref>\n\nIn the wooded hills of the park, common animals include bobcats, coyotes, foxes, squirrels, [[armadillo]]s, and raccoons. Lake fishing is good for largemouth bass, white bass, crappie, and catfish.<ref name=\"Cedar Hill State Park Nature\"/>\n\nThe Cedar Hill State Park has approximately 200 species of birds and is home to many other [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropical]] migrants.  The most sought after bird at the park is the [[painted bunting]], common from May through August.<ref name=\"Cedar Hill State Park Nature\"/>\n\n====Joe Pool Lake====\nCedar Hill rests on the edge of [[Joe Pool Lake]].  The lake was impounded in 1986, has a surface area of 6,469 acres and a maximum depth of 75 feet.  Joe Pool Lake can be accessed through the Cedar Hill State Park or any other of the three parks located along its borders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fishing Joe Pool Lake|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/fish/recreational/lakes/joe_pool/|website=tpwd.texas.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Pool Lake, Texas|url=http://www.joe-pool-lake.org/|website=www.joe-pool-lake.org}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\nCedar Hill hosts local, regional, and national sports tournaments.  Cedar Hill's sports complexes collectively include 21 baseball and softball fields, 18 soccer pitches, 7 basketball courts, 6 tennis courts, 4 football fields, and a 36-hole disc golf course.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting Facilities {{!}} Cedar Hill, TX - Official Website|url=http://cedarhilltx.com/1693/Sporting-Facilities|website=cedarhilltx.com}}</ref>\n\n===Points of Interest===\n\n====Towers====\nIn the 1950s, Cedar Hill became home to what was then known as Hill Tower.  At 880 feet above sea level, Cedar Hill's elevation made it a desirable location for installation of the broadcast antennas.  Hill Tower was the first single tower owned and operated by two television stations at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|title=RCA Broadcast News, October 1955|url=http://www.akdart.com/vtr/rca/rca.html|work=www.akdart.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, then CBS affiliate, KRLD-TV, and ABC affiliate WFAA-TV, were the leading television stations of Dallas. Both stations were in competition for the same location, thus the idea of Hill Tower was born.   The tower would reach over 1,500 feet into the sky and be topped with an 80-foot triangular platform consisting of two antennas, one for each station.  Dubbed 'the candelabra', both antennas were of equal height and equal centers of radiation.<ref>{{cite news|title=RCA Broadcast News, October 1955|url=http://www.akdart.com/vtr/rca/rca.html|work=www.akdart.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the construction of Hill Tower, many other local television and radio stations have located here, and more recently, mobile communications technology service providers.  Today, Cedar Hill has the highest concentration of radio and television communication antennas in the county with 14 towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|title=Towers {{!}} Cedar Hill, TX - Official Website|url=http://cedarhilltx.com/1725/Towers|website=cedarhilltx.com}}</ref>\n\nVisible from 20 miles away on a clear night, the towers have become a landmark for travelers.<ref name=\"More History\"/>  They also serve as a navigational landmark for aircraft pilots who use the towers as a guide.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Penn Farm Agricultural History Center====\nFarmers such as John Wesley Penn utilized the natural resources of the land to build farms and provided shelter and sustenance for their families.  The Penn family lived and grazed livestock on the native prairie grasses for over a hundred years.  During that time, most of the [[tallgrass prairie]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] vanished \u2013 plowed under and replaced with crops of wheat or [[cotton]]. Perhaps because of the rocky surface and hilly terrain of the Cedar Hill area, the prairie remnants at Penn Farm survived and are maintained today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interpretive Guide to Cedar Hill State Park and Penn Farm Agricultural Center|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_br_p4503_0131o.pdf|website=Texas Parks & Wildlife}}</ref>\n\n[[Penn Farm Agricultural History Center]] was created from the remnants of Penn Farm, which date back to the 1850s.<ref name=\"Cedar Hill State Park History\"/>  The center is located within Cedar Hill State Park.  It was designed to educate people about early life in Cedar Hill and to demonstrate how human invention rendered the greatest impact on the tallgrass prairie once prominent in this area.  Many of the original structures still remain standing, showing the evolution of machinery constructed and adapted by the Penn family as needs changed and modern conveniences were added.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interpretive Guide to Cedar Hill State Park and Penn Farm Agricultural Center|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_br_p4503_0131o.pdf|website=Texas Parks & Wildlife}}</ref>\n\n====Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center====\nDogwood Canyon Audubon Center was built as a partnership between Cedar Hill and the [[National Audubon Society]].  On April 23, 2008, John Flicker, former president of the National Audubon Society, led the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center.  The Center officially opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farwell|first1=Scott|title=Ecosystems converge at Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center, opening in Cedar Hill this weekend|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/cedar-hill/headlines/20110906-ecosystems-converge-at-dogwood-canyon-audubon-center-opening-in-cedar-hill-this-weekend.ece|publisher=Dallas Morning News|date=6 Sep 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Robert|title=New Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center is a nature lover\u2019s dream|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/robert-miller/20110903-new-dogwood-canyon-audubon-center-is-a-nature-lovers-dream.ece|work=Dallas Morning News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center {{!}} Cedar Hill, TX - Official Website|url=http://cedarhilltx.com/861/Dogwood-Canyon-Audubon-Center|website=cedarhilltx.com}}</ref>\n\nThe visitor center has been awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)]] Gold Certification, established by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and verified by the [[Green Building Certification Institute|Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI)]], for energy use, lighting, water, and material use as well as incorporating a variety of other sustainable strategies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Building|url=http://dogwoodcanyon.audubon.org/conservation/green-building|website=dogwoodcanyon.audubon.org|date=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center partnered with the [[Cedar Hill Independent School District]] on a study linking outdoor science education to academic performance.

In 1856, a [[tornado]] swept through the town killing nine people and destroying most of its buildings. The seat of the county was moved to Dallas not long after.\n\n==History==\nCedar Hill was founded around 1846 by a small group of settlers from the [[Peters Colony]].  They came from Kentucky, Alabama, and surrounding areas to arrive in the Dallas area of North Texas.  197 families and 184 single men settled in what is now Cedar Hill, making it the largest settlement in the area at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://cedarhillmuseum.com/history/|website=Cedar Hill Museum of History}}</ref>\n\nCedar Hill currently has 5 homes listed on the [[National Park Service]]\u2019s National Register of Historic Places,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/|website=National Park Service}}</ref> 4 historical structures on the [[Texas Historical Commission]]\u2019s list of Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, and 2 graveyards designated as \u201cHistorical Texas Cemeteries\u201d by the Texas Historical Commission, one of which is believed to be the oldest integrated cemetery in Dallas County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks|url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/preserve/projects-and-programs/recorded-texas-historic-landmarks|website=Texas Historical Commission}}</ref>\n\n===1856 Tornado===\nOn April 29, 1856, Cedar Hill was struck by a tornado that claimed at least nine lives, damaged property, killed livestock, and reportedly left only two structures standing.  Among the survivors was teacher and pastor, Robert Crawford.  Crawford donated four acres of his land to church trustees to be designated as a free and indiscriminate public graveyard.  Nine victims of the tornado were buried on Crawford\u2019s land.<ref>{{cite web|title=More History|url=http://cedarhillmuseum.com/history/more-history/|website=Cedar Hill Museum of History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Crawford's Tornado Graveyard|url=http://cedarhilltx.com/1727/Crawfords-Tornado-Graveyard|website=cedarhilltx.com}}</ref>\n\nThe graveyard lay lost for about 100 years.

An economic development advisory committee was formed by the city council that surveyed the residents to see how they envisioned Cedar Hill's future. Based on the response, subcommittees were formed to look into funding, asset enhancement, and community image.\n\nIn January 1994 voters approved a special sales tax to fund the economic development efforts, and the Cedar Hill EDC was incorporated in September 1994. They began with an annual budget of $150,000, and have increased it to $3.5 million with their development efforts.  The economic development corporation has been a huge proponent in development activity in the City, assisting with recruiting and retaining businesses.\n\nSince 2000, the city has added several retail outlets. The opening of The Plaza at Cedar Hill, in the fall of 2000, began the growth. This {{convert|260000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} retail center included a variety of large and small stores, including [[Pier 1 Imports]], [[Macaroni Grill]], David's Seafood, [[Chili's]], [[Hobby Lobby]] and [[OfficeMax]].

At 880 feet above sea level, Cedar Hill\u2019s elevation made it a desirable location for installation of the broadcast antennas.  Hill Tower was the first single tower owned and operated by two television stations at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|title=RCA Broadcast News, October 1955|url=http://www.akdart.com/vtr/rca/rca.html|work=www.akdart.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, then CBS affiliate, KRLD-TV, and ABC affiliate WFAA-TV, were the leading television stations of Dallas. Both stations were in competition for the same location, thus the idea of Hill Tower was born.   The tower would reach over 1,500 feet into the sky and be topped with an 80-foot triangular platform consisting of two antennas, one for each station.  Dubbed 'the candelabra', both antennas were of equal height and equal centers of radiation.<ref>{{cite news|title=RCA Broadcast News, October 1955|url=http://www.akdart.com/vtr/rca/rca.html|work=www.akdart.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the construction of Hill Tower, many other local television and radio stations have located here, and more recently, mobile communications technology service providers.

The Penn family lived and grazed livestock on the native prairie grasses for over a hundred years.  During that time, most of the [[tallgrass prairie]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] vanished \u2013 plowed under and replaced with crops of wheat or [[cotton]]. Perhaps because of the rocky surface and hilly terrain of the Cedar Hill area, the prairie remnants at Penn Farm survived and are maintained today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interpretive Guide to Cedar Hill State Park and Penn Farm Agricultural Center|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_br_p4503_0131o.pdf|website=Texas Parks & Wildlife}}</ref>\n\n[[Penn Farm Agricultural History Center]] was created from the remnants of Penn Farm, which date back to the 1850s.<ref name=\"Cedar Hill State Park History\"/>  The center is located within Cedar Hill State Park.  It was designed to educate people about early life in Cedar Hill and to demonstrate how human invention rendered the greatest impact on the tallgrass prairie once prominent in this area.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.
