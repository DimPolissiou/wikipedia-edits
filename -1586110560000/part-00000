It is the capital of [[H\u00e0 Giang Province]]. The city has an area of 135.33&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 71,689 inhabitants. The population is composed of 22 different ethnicities, of which 55.7% are [[Kinh]] and [[T\u00e0y people]].\n\n==History==\nUp until the 19th century the settlement of [[V\u1ecb Xuy\u00ean]], to the south of H\u00e0 Giang (chu Han: \u6cb3\u694a), was the principal market town in the area. Under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]] the town of H\u00e0 Giang, in what is now [[:vi:Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa District]], began to grow in size. In 1842 the town was included in the former [[Tuy\u00ean Quang Province]]. The town became an important French military outpost after 1886.<ref>Tim Doling ''North East VietNam: mountains and ethnic minorities'' 2000 Page 98 \"Throughout the medieval and early modern period, the largest settlement in the area was at V\u1ecb Xuy\u00ean, south of H\u00e0 Giang, but under the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty (1802-1945) the town of H\u00e0 Giang - located on the east bank of the L\u00f4 River in what is now the Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u1ee7 District- began to grow steadily in size.

When separated, [[H\u00e0 Giang Province]] contained 10 administrative units, and H\u00e0 Giang town became the provincial town of H\u00e0 Giang.\n\nOn September 27, 2010, H\u00e0 Giang town was officially upgraded into a provincial city.\n\nIn March 2014, the urban development project type II was approved by the Prime Minister in Decision No. 190, which includes the provinces of [[V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac Province|V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac]], H\u00e0 Giang, and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf Province|Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf]], thanks to a non-refundable aid package from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). With regards to H\u00e0 Giang province, the project includes upgrading of roads, construction of 2 new bridges, and upgrading the sewage system. This investment in H\u00e0 Giang will promote economic and social sustainable development, a prerequisite for the development of the area.\n\n==Administration==\nThe following administrative units are recognized as part of H\u00e0 Giang city:\n\n* [[:vi:Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa Ward]]\n* Minh Khai Ward\n* [[:vi:Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i Ward]]\n* [[:vi:Quang Trung, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Quang Trung Ward]]\n* Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e0 Ward \n* Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Thi\u1ec7n\n* Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0110\u1ed9\n* Ng\u1ecdc \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng\n\n==Economy==\nH\u00e0 Giang province is a highly mountainous region. Much of the province is too mountainous for agriculture, leaving much of the land covered by forests. H\u00e0 Giang's central plateau is good for growing plums, peaches, and persimmons, which the province exports. Tea is also grown. \n\nH\u00e0 Giang is one of the poorest provinces of Vietnam. Traditionally, the vast majority of its economic activity revolved around agriculture and forestry, but in recent years, there have been attempts to establish a manufacturing industry. Infrastructure in H\u00e0 Giang has seen improvement, but remains poor - roads, schools, and health services are less developed than in many other parts of Vietnam. Since the designation of [[Dong Van Karst Plateau Geopark]] in 2010, the tourism industry has been growing.\n\n==Demographics==\nMany people in H\u00e0 Giang belong to one of Vietnam's ethnic minorities. Aside from the Viet (or [[Kinh]]), the most numerous ethnic groups in H\u00e0 Giang are the [[T\u00e0y people|T\u00e0y]], the [[Dao people|Dao]], and the [[Hmong people|Hmong]].\n\n==Climate==\nLike most of northern Vietnam, H\u00e0 Giang has a dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cwa''').\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y

With regards to H\u00e0 Giang province, the project includes upgrading of roads, construction of 2 new bridges, and upgrading the sewage system. This investment in H\u00e0 Giang will promote economic and social sustainable development, a prerequisite for the development of the area.\n\n==Administration==\nThe following administrative units are recognized as part of H\u00e0 Giang city:\n\n* [[:vi:Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa Ward]]\n* Minh Khai Ward\n* [[:vi:Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i Ward]]\n* [[:vi:Quang Trung, th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 Giang|Quang Trung Ward]]\n* Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e0 Ward \n* Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Thi\u1ec7n\n* Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0110\u1ed9\n* Ng\u1ecdc \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng\n\n==Economy==\nH\u00e0 Giang province is a highly mountainous region. Much of the province is too mountainous for agriculture, leaving much of the land covered by forests. H\u00e0 Giang's central plateau is good for growing plums, peaches, and persimmons, which the province exports. Tea is also grown. \n\nH\u00e0 Giang is one of the poorest provinces of Vietnam. Traditionally, the vast majority of its economic activity revolved around agriculture and forestry, but in recent years, there have been attempts to establish a manufacturing industry. Infrastructure in H\u00e0 Giang has seen improvement, but remains poor - roads, schools, and health services are less developed than in many other parts of Vietnam. Since the designation of [[Dong Van Karst Plateau Geopark]] in 2010, the tourism industry has been growing.\n\n==Demographics==\nMany people in H\u00e0 Giang belong to one of Vietnam\u2019s ethnic minorities. Aside from the Viet (or [[Kinh]]), the most numerous ethnic groups in H\u00e0 Giang are the [[T\u00e0y people|T\u00e0y]], the [[Dao people|Dao]], and the [[Hmong people|Hmong]].\n\n==Climate==\nLike most of northern Vietnam, H\u00e0 Giang has a dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cwa''').\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|location = H\u00e0 Giang\n|Jan high C = 19.5\n|Feb high C = 20.7\n|Mar high C = 24.2\n|Apr high C = 28.1\n|May high C = 31.3\n|Jun high C = 32.2\n|Jul high C = 32.4\n|Aug high C = 32.6\n|Sep high C = 31.7\n|Oct high C = 28.7\n|Nov high C = 25.1\n|Dec high C = 21.6\n|year high C = 27.3\n|Jan mean C = 15.5\n|Feb mean C = 16.9\n|Mar mean C = 20.3\n|Apr mean C = 24.0\n|May mean C = 26.7\n|Jun mean C = 27.6\n|Jul mean C = 27.6\n|Aug mean C = 27.4\n|Sep mean C = 26.3\n|Oct mean C = 23.7\n|Nov mean C = 20.1\n|Dec mean C = 16.7\n|year mean C = 22.7\n|Jan low C = 13.2\n|Feb low C = 14.6\n|Mar low C = 17.7\n|Apr low C = 21.0\n|May low C = 23.3\n|Jun low C = 24.4\n|Jul low C = 24.6\n|Aug low C = 24.3\n|Sep low C = 23.1\n|Oct low C = 20.7\n|Nov low C = 16.9\n|Dec low C = 13.8\n|year low C = 19.8\n|Jan record high C = 30.0 |Jan record low C = 1.5\n|Feb record high C = 39.8 |Feb record low C = 4.9\n|Mar record high C = 35.3 |Mar record low C = 5.4\n|Apr record high C = 38.3 |Apr record low C = 10.0\n|May record high C = 40.1 |May record low C = 15.2\n|Jun record high C = 38.9 |Jun record low C = 17.3\n|Jul record high C = 40.0 |Jul record low C = 20.1\n|Aug record high C = 39.0 |Aug record low C = 18.1\n|Sep record high C = 38.4 |Sep record low C = 14.3\n|Oct record high C = 38.2 |Oct record low C = 9.8\n|Nov record high C = 33.1 |Nov record low C = 6.5\n|Dec record high C = 30.8 |Dec record low C = 2.0\n|year record high C = 40.1  |year record low C = 1.5 \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 39\n|Feb precipitation mm = 42\n|Mar precipitation mm = 62\n|Apr precipitation mm = 110\n|May precipitation mm = 311\n|Jun precipitation mm = 448\n|Jul precipitation mm = 520\n|Aug precipitation mm = 409\n|Sep precipitation mm = 250\n|Oct precipitation mm = 171\n|Nov precipitation mm = 91\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41\n|year precipitation mm = 2492\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.1\n|Feb precipitation days = 10.6\n|Mar precipitation days = 12.3\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.4\n|May precipitation days = 18.4\n|Jun precipitation days = 21.0\n|Jul precipitation days = 24.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 21.7\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 14.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 10.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.4\n|year precipitation days = 184.2\n|Jan humidity = 84.9\n|Feb humidity = 84.2\n|Mar humidity = 82.8\n|Apr humidity = 81.8\n|May humidity = 80.9\n|Jun humidity = 84.4\n|Jul humidity = 86.2\n|Aug humidity = 85.8\n|Sep humidity = 84.1\n|Oct humidity = 83.7\n|Nov humidity = 83.8\n|Dec humidity = 84.3\n|year humidity = 83.9\n|Jan sun = 56\n|Feb sun = 54\n|Mar sun = 70\n|Apr sun = 109\n|May sun = 157\n|Jun sun = 132\n|Jul sun = 157\n|Aug sun = 174\n|Sep sun = 163\n|Oct sun = 130\n|Nov sun = 109\n|Dec sun = 94\n|year sun = 1406\n|source 1 = Vietnam Institute for Building Science and Technology<ref name=IBST>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180722172120/http://ibst.vn/DATA/nhyen/QCVN%2002-2009%20BXD%20So%20lieu%20tu%20nhien.pdf\n| archivedate = 22 July 2018\n| url = http://ibst.vn/DATA/nhyen/QCVN%2002-2009%20BXD%20So%20lieu%20tu%20nhien.pdf\n| title = Vietnam Building Code Natural Physical & Climatic Data for Construction\n| publisher = Vietnam Institute for Building Science and Technology\n| accessdate = 3 August 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|22|50|N|104|59|E|region:VN_type:city_source:enwiki-GNS|display=title}}\n{{Cities in Vietnam}}\n{{Districts of Northeast Vietnam}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ha Giang}}\n[[Category:Provincial capitals in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Populated places in H\u00e0 Giang Province]]\n[[Category:Districts of H\u00e0 Giang Province]]\n[[Category:Cities in Vietnam]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDemographics:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A0_Giang"}

In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under [[East India Company]] and [[British Raj]], the city's population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.<ref name=jn2010>Jan Nijman, A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS, Tijdschrift Voor economic en social geographies, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 4\u201317, February 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanty dwellings, Railway tracks and Mosque in Dharavi Slum Mumbai India February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shanty dwellings next to railway tracks in Dharavi (about 2010).

People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbars, a large Gujarati community of potters (another polluting industry). The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Mumbai, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the [[embroidery]] workers from [[Uttar Pradesh]], started the ready-made garments trade.<ref name=\"NatGeo\" /> These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that have settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi, by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dharavi's first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.<ref name=jn2010 />\n\n===Post-independence===\nAt India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Mumbai and all of India.

Concerns have also been raised by residents who fear that some of their small businesses in the \"informal\" sector may not be relocated under the redevelopment plan.

Dharavi is southern end of Ward H East, and other residential and commercial areas in the Ward marked in dark blue include [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santacruz]], [[Vile Parle]] and [[Mahim]].]]\nDharavi is a large area situated between Mumbai's two main suburban railway lines, the Western and Central Railways. To the west of Dharavi are [[Mahim]] and [[Bandra]], and to the north lies the [[Mithi River]]. The Mithi River empties into the [[Arabian Sea]] through the [[Mahim Creek]]. The area of [[Antop Hill]] lies to the east while the locality called [[Matunga]] is located in the South. Due to its location and poor sewage and drainage systems, Dharavi particularly becomes vulnerable to floods during the [[wet season]].\n\nDharavi is considered one of the largest slums in the world. The low-rise building style and narrow street structure of the area make Dharavi very cramped and confined. Like most slums, it is overpopulated. Compared to Mumbai's urban [[floor space index]] (FSI) of a range from 5 to 15, in Dharavi it is about 13.3 [[citation needed]]. Government officials are considering changing the Dharavi's floor space index to 4. Despite the expensive Mumbai lifestyle, Dharavi provides a cheap alternative where rent is as low as Rs.1,000 per month.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:An embroidery unit in Dharavi, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|left|An embroidery unit in Dharavi.]]\nIn addition to the traditional [[pottery]] and textile industries in Dharavi,<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> there is an increasingly large [[recycling]] industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of [[Mumbai]].

Water access derives from public standpipes stationed throughout the slum. Additionally, with the limited lavatories they have, they are extremely filthy and broken down to the point of being unsafe. Mahim Creek is a local river that is widely used by local residents for urination and defecation causing the spread of contagious diseases.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> The open sewers in the city drain to the creek causing a spike in water pollutants, septic conditions, and foul odors. Due to the air pollutants, diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and asthma are common among residents. There are government proposals in regards to improving Dharavi's sanitation issues. The residents have a section where they wash their clothes in water that people defecate in. This spreads the amount of disease as doctors have to deal with over 4,000 cases of typhoid a day. There is also an average of 1 toilet per 500 people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Epidemics and other disasters==\nDharavi has experienced a long history of epidemics and natural disasters, sometimes with significant loss of lives.

However, once having entered the narrow lanes Dharavi proves that the prejudice of slums as dirty, underdeveloped, and criminal places does not fit real living conditions. Sure, communal sanitation blocks that are mostly in a miserable condition and overcrowded space do not comfort the living. Inside the huts, it is, however, very clean, and some huts share some elements of beauty. Nice curtains at the windows and balconies covered by flowers and plants indicate that people try to arrange their homes as cosy and comfortable as possible.\n |source   = Denis Gruber et al.

In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under [[East India Company]] and [[British Raj]], the city's population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.<ref name=jn2010>Jan Nijman, A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS, Tijdschrift Voor economic en social geographies, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 4\u201317, February 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanty dwellings, Railway tracks and Mosque in Dharavi Slum Mumbai India February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shanty dwellings next to railway tracks in Dharavi (about 2010).

The railway network provides mass transit to the slum residents.]]\nThe most polluting industries were tanneries, and the first tannery moved from peninsular Mumbai into Dharavi in 1887. People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbars, a large Gujarati community of potters (another polluting industry). The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Mumbai, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the [[embroidery]] workers from [[Uttar Pradesh]], started the ready-made garments trade.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that have settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi, by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dharavi's first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.<ref name=jn2010/>\n\n===Post-independence===\nAt India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Mumbai and all of India. It still had a few empty spaces, which continued to serve as waste-dumping grounds for operators across the city.<ref name=jn2010/> Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to grow as a city. Soon Dharavi was surrounded by the city, and became a key hub for informal economy.<ref>, Eyre, L. (1990), The shanty towns of central Bombay.

Concerns have also been raised by residents who fear that some of their small businesses in the \"informal\" sector may not be relocated under the redevelopment plan.

Dharavi is southern end of Ward H East, and other residential and commercial areas in the Ward marked in dark blue include [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santacruz]], [[Vile Parle]] and [[Mahim]].]]\nDharavi is a large area situated between Mumbai's two main suburban railway lines, the Western and Central Railways. To the west of Dharavi are [[Mahim]] and [[Bandra]], and to the north lies the [[Mithi River]]. The Mithi River empties into the [[Arabian Sea]] through the [[Mahim Creek]]. The area of [[Antop Hill]] lies to the east while the locality called [[Matunga]] is located in the South. Due to its location and poor sewage and drainage systems, Dharavi particularly becomes vulnerable to floods during the [[wet season]].\n\nDharavi is considered one of the largest slums in the world. The low-rise building style and narrow street structure of the area make Dharavi very cramped and confined. Like most slums, it is overpopulated. Compared to Mumbai's urban [[floor space index]] (FSI) of a range from 5 to 15, in Dharavi it is about 13.3 [[citation needed]]. Government officials are considering changing the Dharavi's floor space index to 4. Despite the expensive Mumbai lifestyle, Dharavi provides a cheap alternative where rent is as low as Rs.1000 per month.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:An embroidery unit in Dharavi, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|left|An embroidery unit in Dharavi.]]\nIn addition to the traditional [[pottery]] and textile industries in Dharavi,<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> there is an increasingly large [[recycling]] industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of [[Mumbai]].

Water access derives from public standpipes stationed throughout the slum. Additionally, with the limited lavatories they have, they are extremely filthy and broken down to the point of being unsafe. Mahim Creek is a local river that is widely used by local residents for urination and defecation causing the spread of contagious diseases.<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> The open sewers in the city drain to the creek causing a spike in water pollutants, septic conditions, and foul odors. Due to the air pollutants, diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and asthma are common among residents. There are government proposals in regards to improving Dharavi's sanitation issues. The residents have a section where they wash their clothes in water that people defecate in. This spreads the amount of disease as doctors have to deal with over 4,000 cases of typhoid a day. There is also an average of 1 toilet per 500 people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Epidemics and other disasters==\nDharavi has experienced a long history of epidemics and natural disasters, sometimes with significant loss of lives.
