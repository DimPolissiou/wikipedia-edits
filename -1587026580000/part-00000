the result of repetitive events of cycling loading, and appears to be associated with osteocyte death by apoptosis, which appear to secrete a signal to target osteoclasts to perform remodeling at a damaged site.<ref name=\"Heino_2009\"/> Under normal conditions, osteocytes express high amounts of TGF-\u03b2 and thus repress bone resorption, but when bone grows old, the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 decrease, and the expression of osteoclast-stimulatory factors, such as [[RANKL]] and [[Macrophage colony-stimulating factor|M-CSF]] increases, bone resorption is then enhanced, leading to net bone loss.<ref name=\"Heino_2009\"/>\n\nMechanical stimulation of osteocytes results in opening of hemichannels to release PGE2 and ATP, among other biochemical signaling  molecules, which play a

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and have been fully withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions \n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\nProduction of these locomotives started in 1970 with #20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with #21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. \n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n== Named Locos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named&page=10|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster List|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Named Locos\n!Class\n!Loco Number\n!Name\n!Loco Shed\n!Current status\n!ref\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20401 \n|   <abbr>BIA</abbr>  \n|Rajatabha  \n|Condemned [07/08/2007]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4489?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20420   \n|BZA\n|Sukh Sagar Naveen \n|Scrapped\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4508?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20615    \n| <abbr>ASN</abbr>  \n|Surubhi \n|Condemned in November 2011\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4703?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21320 \n|<abbr>AJJ</abbr>\n|Garuda \n|Plinthed at Rail Soudha, SWR HQ, Hubli [January 2020]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4908?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21380 \n|<abbr>ASN</abbr> \n|Navchetna  \n|In Inferior service\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4968?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21399  \n| <abbr>BSL</abbr> \n|Anant \n|The last WAM-4 ever built.

However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and have been fully withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990.

Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. \n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n== Named Locos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named&page=10|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster List|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Named Locos\n!Class\n!Loco Number\n!Name\n!Loco Shed\n!Current status\n!ref\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20401 \n|   <abbr>BIA</abbr>  \n|Rajatabha  \n|Condemned [07/08/2007]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4489?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20420   \n|BZA\n|Sukh Sagar Naveen \n|Scrapped\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4508?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20615    \n| <abbr>ASN</abbr>  \n|Surubhi \n|Condemned in November 2011\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4703?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21320 \n|<abbr>AJJ</abbr>\n|Garuda \n|Plinthed at Rail Soudha, SWR HQ, Hubli [January 2020]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4908?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21380 \n|<abbr>ASN</abbr> \n|Navchetna  \n|In Inferior service\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4968?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21399  \n| <abbr>BSL</abbr> \n|Anant \n|The last WAM-4 ever built.

It is part of a series of fourteen numbered compositions collectively titled ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'', ranging from solos for guitar and for piano up to works scored for soloist or chorus with orchestra or multiple orchestras. ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'' is the longest in the series, a performance lasting over an hour.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Arthur Rubinstein.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Rubinstein, dedicatee of ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'', in 1938]]\nAccording to the official account, ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'' was composed in Rio de Janeiro in 1928, and the score is dedicated to [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. The first known performance was given on 18 July 1942 in Rio de Janeiro by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jos\u00e9 Vieira Brand\u00e3o|pt}}, piano, and the Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]], conducted by the composer {{harv|''Villa-Lobos, sua obra''|2009|loc=26}}. However, for a variety of reasons it seems more likely that it may have begun in 1928, but was only completed in 1941, after Arthur Rubinstein had requested a piano concerto during a visit to Rio in 1939 {{harv|Peppercorn|1991|loc=75n5}}.\n\nThe only known surviving page of the original 1928 score (marked \"page 8\" in the margin) is reproduced in {{harvnb|Demarquez|1929a|loc=710\u201311}}. The piano solo part is identical with the final published score, at rehearsal number 43, but there are differences in the orchestration {{harv|Lago|2015|loc=92}}.\n\nBecause he realised that its extraordinary length, in a single movement, would inhibit uncut performances, Villa-Lobos specified cuts that would make a shorter performing version of only about thirty-five minutes {{harv|N\u00f3brega|1975|loc=117}}.\n\n==Scoring==\nThe work is scored for solo piano and a large orchestra consisting of 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, 2 clarinets in B{{Music|flat}}, bass clarinet, soprano saxophone in B{{Music|flat}}, alto saxophone in E{{Music|flat}}, 2 bassoons, 2 contrabassoons, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, tam-tam, cymbals, reco-reco, chocalho, side drum, tambourine, tambor, coco, cabacinhas, caxambu, cu\u00edca, xylophone, vibraphone, celesta, 2 harps, and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Interior do Theatro Municipal.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Theatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, where ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'' was premiered]]\nThe composer compares the structure of ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'' to that of the baroque [[concerto grosso]], because of the solo role of the  piano, \"whose technical virtuosity on the curious fantasy of recurring themes fully confirms the tendency of its type.\" However, it also takes advantage of aspects of the [[symphonic poem]], the [[symphony]], the classical [[serenade]], and the [[Fantasia (music)|fantasy]], all of which contribute to explaining the extraordinary length of an hour or more in performance {{harv|Villa-Lobos|1972|loc=204\u2013205}}.\n\nAlthough ''Chor\u00f4s No. 11'' is in a single continuous movement, the long central [[modinha]] in slow tempo stands apart from the surrounding material, for its \"languid, sequential, and dream-inhabited melody\" clothed in \"twisted and rather chilling harmony\" {{harv|Wright|1992|loc=69}}. Indeed, the work as a whole can be regarded as being in three conventional, but linked movements, though the boundary between the first and second is somewhat vague: A rhapsodic and enigmatic opening (Allegro preciso \u2013 Allegro moderato \u2013 Misterioso \u2013 Andantino \u2013 Marcha), a lyrical slow movement in two sections (Adagio), and a complex [[rondo]] finale (Allegro moderato) {{harv|Tarasti|1991|loc=131\u201333}}.\n\nVilla-Lobos calls particular attention to a number of features of the work {{harv|Villa-Lobos|1972|loc=205}}:\n# the energetic and mechanical rhythm of the opening; \n# the melody with a primitive character (number 29) \n# that simultaneously serves as a bass for crossed arpeggios, with the same sounds of the primitive scale; \n# unforeseen and strange modulations (number 41); \n# various melodic types accompanied by unusual harmonies (number 46); \n# a sentimental melody with a simple dissonant harmony and on a vague rhythm, forming a characteristic space (number 55); \n# an unimportant melody enriched by harmony; \n# a theme of primitive form that serves as a subject for a short fugato (number 78); \n# at rehearsal number 80 appears a [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], restating one of the early themes of the work a major third lower; \n# finally, a warm, passionate, and extremely vague melody appears, in the midst of contrary and syncopated harmonies and rhythms, muddying the rhythmic center of gravity.\n\n==Discography==\nIn chronological order of recording:\n* Villa-Lobos: ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11 pour piano et orchestre; Ch\u00f4ros No. 2 pour fl\u00fbte et clarinette; Ch\u00f4ros No. 5 pour piano; Bachianas Brasileiras No. 1 pour ensemble de violincelles''.

''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'' is the longest in the series, a performance lasting over an hour.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Arthur Rubinstein.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Rubinstein, dedicatee of ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'', in 1938]]\nAccording to the official account, ''Ch\u00f4ros No. 11'' was composed in Rio de Janeiro in 1928, and the score is dedicated to [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. The first known performance was given on 18 July 1942 in Rio de Janeiro by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jos\u00e9 Vieira Brand\u00e3o|pt}}, piano, and the Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]], conducted by the composer {{harv|''Villa-Lobos,sua obra''|2009|loc=26}}.

In addition to the single living [[genus]], '''''Rhinolophus''''', one extinct genus, ''[[Palaeonycteris]]'', has been recognized. Horseshoe bats are closely related to the [[Hipposideridae]], which have sometimes been included in Rhinolophidae. Internally, the horseshoe bats are divided into six subgenera and many species groups. The common ancestor of all horseshoe bats lived 34\u201340&nbsp;million years ago, though it is unclear where the geographic roots of the family are, and attempts to determine the biogeography of the family have been indecisive. Their taxonomy is complex, as genetic evidence shows the likely existence of many [[Species complex|cryptic species]], as well as species recognized as distinct that may, in fact, have little [[genetic divergence]] from previously recognized taxa. They are found in the Old World, mostly in tropical or subtropical areas, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.\n\nHorseshoe bats are considered small or medium-sized [[microbat]]s, weighing {{Cvt|4-28|g|oz}}, with forearm lengths of {{Cvt|30-75|mm|in}} and combined head and body lengths of {{Cvt|35-110|mm|in}}. Fur can be reddish-brown, blackish, or bright orange-red, with a majority of species having long, smooth fur. They get their common name from their large [[nose-leaf]]s, which are shaped like horseshoes. The nose-leafs aid in echolocation; horseshoe bats have highly sophisticated echolocation, using constant frequency, high-duty calls to detect prey in areas of high environmental clutters. They hunt insects and spiders, swooping down on prey from a perch, or gleaning from foliage. Little is known about their mating systems, but at least one species is monogamous, while another is polygynous. Gestation is approximately seven weeks and one offspring is produced at a time. A typical lifespan is six or seven years, but one [[greater horseshoe bat]] lived more than thirty years.\n\nHorseshoe bats are relevant to humans as a source of disease and as food and medicine in some regions. Several species are the natural reservoirs of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS coronavirus]], though [[masked palm civet]]s were the intermediate hosts through which humans became infected. Some evidence suggests that some species could be the natural reservoir of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], which causes [[coronavirus disease 2019]]. They are hunted for food in several regions, particularly [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but also Southeast Asia. Some species or their [[guano]] are used in [[traditional medicine]] in Nepal, India, Vietnam, and Senegal.\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\n===Taxonomic history===\n{{see also|List of horseshoe bats}}\n''Rhinolophus'' was first described as a genus in 1799 by French naturalist [[Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de]].

The first strategy is fly slow and low over the ground, hunting among trees and bushes. Some species who use this strategy are able to hover over prey and [[Gleaning (birds)|glean]] them from the substrate.

In addition to the single living [[genus]], '''''Rhinolophus''''', one extinct genus, ''[[Palaeonycteris]]'', has been recognized. Horseshoe bats are closely related to the [[Hipposideridae]], which have sometimes been included in Rhinolophidae. Internally, the horseshoe bats are divided into six subgenera and many species groups. The common ancestor of all horseshoe bats lived 34\u201340&nbsp;million years ago, though it is unclear where the geographic roots of the family are, and attempts to determine the biogeography of the family have been indecisive. Their taxonomy is complex, as genetic evidence shows the likely existence of many [[Species complex|cryptic species]], as well as species recognized as distinct that may, in fact, have little [[genetic divergence]] from previously recognized taxa. They are found in the Old World, mostly in tropical or subtropical areas, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.\n\nHorseshoe bats are considered small or medium-sized [[microbat]]s, weighing {{Cvt|4-28|g|oz}}, with forearm lengths of {{Cvt|30-75|mm|in}} and combined head and body lengths of {{Cvt|35-110|mm|in}}. Fur can be reddish-brown, blackish, or bright orange-red, with a majority of species having long, smooth fur. They get their common name from their large [[nose-leaf]]s, which are shaped like horseshoes. The nose-leafs aid in echolocation; horseshoe bats have highly sophisticated echolocation, using constant frequency, high-duty calls to detect prey in areas of high environmental clutters. They hunt insects and spiders, swooping down on prey from a perch, or gleaning from foliage. Little is known about their mating systems, but at least one species is monogamous, while another is polygynous. Gestation is approximately seven weeks and one offspring is produced at a time. A typical lifespan is six or seven years, but one [[greater horseshoe bat]] lived more than thirty years.\n\nHorseshoe bats are relevant to humans as a source of disease and as food and medicine in some regions. Several species are the natural reservoirs of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS coronavirus]], though [[masked palm civet]]s were the intermediate hosts through which humans became infected. Some evidence suggests that some species could be the natural reservoir of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], which causes [[coronavirus disease 2019]]. They are hunted for food in several regions, particularly [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but also Southeast Asia. Some species or their [[guano]] are used in [[traditional medicine]] in Nepal, India, Vietnam, and Senegal.\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\n===Taxonomic history===\n{{see also|List of horseshoe bats}}\n''Rhinolophus'' was first described as a genus in 1799 by French naturalist [[Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de]].

The first strategy is fly slow and low over the ground, hunting among trees and bushes. Some species who use this strategy are able to hover over prey and [[Gleaning (birds)|glean]] them from the substrate. The other strategy is known as perch feeding: Individuals roost on feeding perches and wait for prey to fly past, then fly out to capture it.<ref name=Csorba2003/>{{rp|page=&nbsp;xi}} Foraging usually occurs {{cvt|16.5-19.5|ft|m|order=flip}} above the ground.<ref name=\"Geist\"/> While [[vesper bat]]s may catch prey in their uropatagia and transfer it to their mouths, horseshoe bats do not use their uropatagia to catch prey. At least one species, the greater horseshoe bat, has been documented catching prey in the tip of its wing by bending the phalanges around it, then transferring it to its mouth.<ref name=\"Kingdon 2013\"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(62)90056-8 |title=The role of the flight membranes in insect capture by bats |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=10 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=332\u2013340 |year=1962 |last1=Webster |first1=Frederic A. |last2=Griffin |first2=Donald R.}}</ref>\n\nThey have especially small and rounded wingtips, low [[Bat_flight#Wing_loading|wing loading]] (meaning they lave large wings relative to body mass), and high [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]].

Some species, like [[R\u00fcppell's horseshoe bat]] (''R.&nbsp;fumigatus''), Hildebrandt's horseshoe bat, [[Lander's horseshoe bat]] (''R.&nbsp;landeri''), and [[Swinny's horseshoe bat]] (''R.&nbsp;swinnyi''), have particularly large total wing area, though most horseshoe bat species have average wing area.<ref name=Norberg1987/>{{rp|page=387}}\n\n===Reproduction and life cycle===\nThe mating systems of horseshoe bats are poorly understood. A review in 2000 noted that only about 4% of species had published information about their mating systems; along with the [[free-tailed bat]]s (Molossidae), they had the least attention of any bat family relative to their species diversity. At least one species, the greater horseshoe bat, appears to have a [[polygynous]] mating system where males attempt to establish and defend territories, attracting multiple females. ''[[Rhinolophus sedulus]]'', however, is a rare species of bat that is believed to be [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]] (only 17&nbsp;bat species are recognized as such as of 2000).<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-012195670-7/50009-6 |chapter=Bat Mating Systems |title=Reproductive Biology of Bats |pages=321\u2013362 |year=2000 |last1=McCracken |first1=Gary F. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Gerald S. |isbn=9780121956707}}</ref> Some species, particularly temperate species, have an annual [[breeding season]] in the fall, while other species mate in the spring.<ref name=\"Nowak1994\"/> Many horseshoe bat species have the adaptation of delayed fertilization through [[female sperm storage]].

In hibernating species, the sperm storage timing coincides with hibernation.<ref name=Csorba2003/>{{rp|page=&nbsp;xi}} Other species like [[Lander's horseshoe bat]] (''R.&nbsp;landeri'') have [[embryonic diapause]], meaning that while fertilization occurs directly following copulation, the [[zygote]] does not implant into the uterine wall for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Kingdon 2013\"/> The greater horseshoe bat has the adaptation of delayed embryonic development, meaning that growth of the [[embryo]] is conditionally delayed if the female enters torpor.

The development of the franchise's first installment, ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', started in 1993. The filmmakers [[Eduardo Sanchez (director)|Eduardo S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Daniel Myrick]] wrote a 35-page outline of a story with the dialogue to be improvised. Filming began in 1997 and lasted eight days. The film follows the disappearance of three student filmmakers in the woods near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] while shooting a documentary on the local legend known as the \"Blair Witch\".\n\nAfter premiering at the 1999 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film was released on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity during a controversial promotional campaign. The film went on to be a massive commercial success, and a sequel, ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', was released on October 27, 2000. A second official sequel, ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]'', was released on September 16, 2016. Series of video games, books, novels and comic books were released to accompany the films.\n\n==Faux legend==\nThe backstory for the movie is a [[wikt:faux|faux]] legend fabricated by S\u00e1nchez and Myrick which is detailed in ''The Curse of the Blair Witch'', a [[mockumentary]] broadcast on the [[SyFy Channel|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1999 prior to the release of ''The Blair Witch Project''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curse of the Blair witch|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/10/29/curse-blair-witch|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> Sanchez and Myrick also maintained a website at BlairWitch.com which added further details to the legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html|title=The Blair Witch|accessdate=4 August 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707140445/http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html|archivedate=7 July 2007|df=}}</ref> It is now the official site of the [[Blair Witch (film)|2016 installment]].\n\nThe fictional tale describes the murders and disappearances of some of the residents of Blair, Maryland, the fictitious former name of [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], from the 18th century to the 20th century. According to the legend, residents always blame these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward (also a fictitious person), a Blair resident executed in 1785 by [[Hypothermia|exposure]] for practicing [[witchcraft]]. The mockumentary presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, [[newsreels]], television news reports, and staged interviews in an attempt to deceive viewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curse of the Blair Witch|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/10/29/curse-blair-witch|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width:99%;\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"3\"| Films\n|-\n!

In the Black Hills forest near Burkittsville, Maryland, many children had vanished in the 1940s and people still avoid going too deep into the woods. The party sets out to look for facts that prove the legend, equipped only with two cameras and a little hiking gear. First, they find little piles of stone that must have been arranged artificially, later, they find themselves lost in the woods. Eerie sounds at night and more piles of stones in places where they have not been before cause the already desperate group to panic. One night, days after they should have been back home, Josh disappears. While searching for Josh, Heather and Mike find a derelict house in a clearing and go inside, where they see runic symbols on the wall next to child-sized handprints. Josh's voice seems to be coming from somewhere inside the house, and Mike rushes upstairs. Mike then realizes that the voice is now coming from the basement, and rushes down the steps. Suddenly, Mike is rendered silent and the camera falls. Hysterical, Heather follows and sees Mike in the corner of the room, faced against a wall. Suddenly Heather's camera is knocked down and she too is rendered silent. The film runs for a few seconds, then dies.\n\n===''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' (2000)===\n{{Main|Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2}}\n''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' returns to Maryland's Black Hills region in the wake of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and the prodigious media coverage devoted to its conflation of documentary style and supernatural legend, fans and curiosity-seekers have descended upon the movie's real-life setting of Burkittsville, Maryland. Jeff Patterson ([[Jeffrey Donovan]]), a black-sheep \"townie\" only recently released from a mental institution, has turned his obsession with the Blair Witch into a business and has lured four young people to Burkittsville for a tour of the Witch's purported Black Hills' haunts. Jeff's clients are also fixated on the film, for reasons they themselves may not fully comprehend. Erica Geerson ([[Erica Leerhsen]]) is a practicing Wiccan who has immersed herself in Blair Witch mythology, even though she decries the film's portrayal of her fellow witches. Grad students Tristen Ryler ([[Tristine Skyler]]) and Stephen Ryan Parker ([[Stephen Barker Turner]]) are writing a book about the Blair Witch, but disagree completely about the story's basis in fact, with folklorist Tristen arguing that it must contain some grain of truth while Stephen insists it's a textbook case of mass hysteria. Completing the group is Kim Diamond ([[Kim Director]]), a hard-edged, sardonic Goth aficionado possessed of striking psychic abilities.\n\nAfter spending a strange and disorienting night at one of the most sinister sites in Blair Witch lore, the five campers awake to a scene of destruction and no memory of having gone to sleep. They return to Jeff's abandoned warehouse loft to try to piece together what happened. But as Jeff leads Erica, Tristen, Stephen and Kim across the rickety drawbridge and unlocks the metal door to a chorus of barking dogs, they are entering a place no safer than the woods they just left. Inside, the legend seems to begin to bleed into reality as their mass hysteria ensues. Erica mysteriously disappears and Tristen ends up hanging herself from the second floor railing of the warehouse.\n\nThe end of the film reveals that Jeff, Stephen, and Kim have been arrested. Each is interrogated separately, with the police showing each person footage of their crimes. Security camera footage shows Kim stabbing a cashier in the neck. Surveillance camera footage shows a naked Jeff killing Erica, arranging her clothes, and putting her dead body in the closet. Jeff's video shows Stephen assaulting Tristen, pushing her over the second floor banister, and accusing her of being a witch. All three, close to a nervous breakdown, proclaim their innocence.\n\nThe tie-in [[mockumentary]] to ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Blair Witch]]'', establishes the events of the film being a [[play within a play|film within a film]]; the in-universe mockumentary reveals that ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' is \"a film adaptation\" based on the \"Black Hills murders\" that took place shortly after the release of ''The Blair Witch Project''. ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows \"the real James Patterson\"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case's events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed within the documentary coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole. Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the \"real\" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.\n\n===''Blair Witch'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Blair Witch (film)}}\nOn September 2, 2009, Ed S\u00e1nchez and [[Daniel Myrick]] announced their intent to produce a third ''Blair Witch'' film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eduardo Sanchez Talks Seventh Moon, Plans for Blair Witch 3 |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8187275.stm| title = The legend of the Witch lives on: Interview| accessdate = 2009-08-11| work = news.bbc.co.uk | date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> The film was a sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not reference any of the events from ''Book of Shadows''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Returns?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> In 2011, S\u00e1nchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting Lionsgate to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Project 3 Moves Forward Says Eduardo Sanchez|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-blair-witch-project-3-moves-forward-says-eduardo-sanchez|publisher=Movie Web|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> The film went into [[development hell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Planned Horror Movie Sequels We're Still Waiting to See |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/list/10-planned-horror-movie-sequels-were-still-waiting-see|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy January 2015, a third ''Blair Witch'' was still in talks.

The first being ''Curse of the Blair Witch'' which aired on the [[Syfy Channel]] in 1999, prior to the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'', and the second being ''Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend'' which overlaps quite a bit with ''Curse of the Blair Witch''. The latter two documentaries, ''The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy'' and ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'', both directed by [[Ben Rock]], aired in 2000.\n\n===''Curse of the Blair Witch'' (1999)===\nBefore the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'' in 1999, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] aired a 45-minute mockumentary about the Blair Witch called ''Curse of the Blair Witch''.\n\nThe program offers firsthand interviews with several fictional colleagues and relatives of Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams, including their Montgomery College film professor.\n\nOne of the highlights of the video is the first mention of Elly Kedward, the woman who would go on to become the Blair Witch.\n\n''Curse of the Blair Witch'' was created to give credibility to the idea that the events of ''The Blair Witch Project'' actually occurred, which was how the film was marketed upon its initial release.\n\n===''Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend'' (1999)===\nDirected by [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[Eduardo S\u00e1nchez (director)|Eduardo S\u00e1nchez]], considered for inclusion in the theatrical release of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and released to [[VHS]] as part of a special promotion that ran when ''The Blair Witch Project'' was released on home video, ''Sticks and Stones'' runs 30 minutes and overlaps with the mockumentary ''Curse of the Blair Witch''. The mockumentary primarily consists of alternate cuts of many of the previous films' interviews, but there is some new material to be found, including a brief 1995 conversation with [[Joshua Leonard]]'s father about his son's disappearance.\n\n''Sticks and Stones'' also includes an extended conversation between [[Heather Donahue]] and [[Michael C. Williams|Michael Williams]] from a [[deleted scene]], that was cut from the theatrical release of ''The Blair Witch Project''.\n\n===''The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy'' (2000)===\nWhen ''The Blair Witch Project'' premiered on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], it was accompanied by a new 40-minute Blair Witch mockumentary named ''The Burkittsville 7'', which delved into the murder case of Rustin Parr that was mentioned in ''The Blair Witch Project''. Within the mockumentary it is theorised that Kyle Brody, the lone survivor of the murders, may have himself been involved in the murders. Within the mockumentary, it is mentioned that after Parr was hanged, Brody grew up to become a troubled adult who spent most of the latter part of his life in mental institutions before committing suicide in the year 1971.\n\n===''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' (2000)===\nDirected by [[Ben Rock]], and airing on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in conjunction with the release of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'', the mockumentary ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' takes an objective look at the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2''. Running 45 minutes, it examines the troubled life of \"the real Jeff Patterson\" and his obsession with ''The Blair Witch Project''. Within the documentary, the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are presented as a film adaptation based on the \"Black Hills murders\" that took place shortly after the events of ''The Blair Witch Project''. This documentary presents ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' as a film within a film.\n\n''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows \"the real James Patterson\"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to [[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|fictionalize the case's events for the big screen]]. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the [[Wiccan]] community as a whole.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:99%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n\n* A dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the film or that the character's presence in the film has yet to be announced.\n* A {{note label|unaccredited|U|}} indicates an unaccredited role.\n* A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates an voice-only role.\n* An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates an appearance through archival footage or stills.\n</blockquote>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" score=\"col\" width=\"14.5%\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"3\" | Theatrical films \n! colspan=\"4\" | Mockumentaries\n|-\n! score=\"col\" width=\"14.5%\" | ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"11.5%\" | ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|{{small|Book of Shadows:}}<br>Blair Witch 2]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"7.5%\" | ''[[Curse of the Blair Witch|{{small|Curse of the}}<br>Blair Witch]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend|Sticks and Stones:<br>{{small|An Exploration of the<br>Blair Witch Legend}}]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"17%\" | ''[[The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy|{{small|The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7:}}<br>The Blair Witch Legacy]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"8%\" | ''[[Shadow of the Blair Witch|{{small|Shadow of the}}<br>Blair Witch]]''\n|-\n! 1999\n! 2000\n! 2016\n! colspan=\"2\" | 1999\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2000\n|-\n!

Stern compiled ''The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier''. Perpetuating the film's \"true story\" angle, the dossier consisted of fabricated police reports, pictures, interviews, and newspaper articles presenting the movie's premise as fact, as well as further elaboration on the Elly Kedward and Rustin Parr legends. In 2000 D.A. Stern compiled another dossier in the same fashion called ''Blair Witch: Book of Shadows'' (released in November, 2000) regarding the events of the second movie.\n\n==Novels==\nStern wrote the 2000 novel ''Blair Witch: The Secret Confessions of Rustin Parr'' and in 2004, revisited the franchise with the novel ''Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift'', featuring all original characters and plot.\n\nIn May 1999, a [[Photonovel]] adaptation of ''The Blair Witch Project'' was written by Claire Forbes and was released by Fotonovel Publications.\n\n===''The Blair Witch Files''===\nA series of eight young adult books entitled ''The Blair Witch Files'' were released by [[Random House|Random]] subsidiary [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] from 2000 to 2001. The books center on Cade Merill, a fictional cousin of Heather Donahue, who investigates phenomena related to the Blair Witch in attempt to discover what really happened to Heather, Mike, and Josh.<ref name=\"Files\">{{cite web |last=Merill |first=Cade |title=Cade Merill's The Blair Witch Files |work=Random House |year=2000 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/blairwitch/home.html |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207020654/http://www.randomhouse.com/features/blairwitch/home.html |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 1&nbsp;\u2013 The Witch's Daughter''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 2&nbsp;\u2013 The Dark Room''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 3&nbsp;\u2013 The Drowning Ghost''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 4&nbsp;\u2013 Blood Nightmare''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 5&nbsp;\u2013 The Death Card''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 6&nbsp;\u2013 The Prisoner''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 7&nbsp;\u2013 The Night Shifters''\n# ''The Blair Witch Files 8&nbsp;\u2013 The Obsession''\n\n==Comic books==\nIn August 1999, [[Oni Press]] released a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic promoting the first film, simply titled ''The Blair Witch Project''. Written by Jen Van Meter and drawn by [[Bernie Mireault]], [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]], and [[Tommy Lee Edwards]], the comic featured three short stories elaborating on the mythology of the Blair Witch. In mid-2000, the same group worked on a four-issue series called ''The Blair Witch Chronicles''.\n\nIn October 2000, coinciding with the release of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'', [[Image Comics]] released a one-shot called ''Blair Witch: Dark Testaments'', drawn by [[Charlie Adlard]] and written by [[Ian Edginton]].\n\n==Video games==\n\nIn 2000, a trilogy of video games based on the films was released, which greatly expanded on the myths suggested in the first film.

The development of the franchise's first installment, ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', started in 1993. The filmmakers [[Eduardo Sanchez (director)|Eduardo S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Daniel Myrick]] wrote a 35-page outline of a story with the dialogue to be improvised. Filming began in 1997 and lasted eight days. The film follows the disappearance of three student filmmakers in the woods near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] while shooting a documentary on the local legend known as the \"Blair Witch\".\n\nAfter premiering at the 1999 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film was released on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity during a controversial promotional campaign. The film went on to be a massive commercial success, and a sequel, ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', was released on October 27, 2000. A second official sequel, ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]'', was released on September 16, 2016. Series of video games, books, novels and comic books were released to accompany the films.\n\n==Faux legend==\nThe backstory for the movie is a [[wikt:faux|faux]] legend fabricated by S\u00e1nchez and Myrick which is detailed in ''The Curse of the Blair Witch'', a [[mockumentary]] broadcast on the [[SyFy Channel|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1999 prior to the release of ''The Blair Witch Project''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curse of the Blair witch|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/10/29/curse-blair-witch|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> Sanchez and Myrick also maintained a website at BlairWitch.com which added further details to the legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html|title=The Blair Witch|accessdate=4 August 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707140445/http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html|archivedate=7 July 2007|df=}}</ref> It is now the official site of the [[Blair Witch (film)|2016 installment]].\n\nThe fictional tale describes the murders and disappearances of some of the residents of Blair, Maryland, the fictitious former name of [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], from the 18th century to the 20th century. According to the legend, residents always blame these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward (also a fictitious person), a Blair resident executed in 1785 by [[Hypothermia|exposure]] for practicing [[witchcraft]]. The mockumentary presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, [[newsreels]], television news reports, and staged interviews in an attempt to deceive viewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curse of the Blair Witch|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/10/29/curse-blair-witch|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width:99%;\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"3\"| Films\n|-\n!

In the Black Hills forest near Burkittsville, Maryland, many children had vanished in the 1940s and people still avoid going too deep into the woods. The party sets out to look for facts that prove the legend, equipped only with two cameras and a little hiking gear. First, they find little piles of stone that must have been arranged artificially, later, they find themselves lost in the woods. Eerie sounds at night and more piles of stones in places where they have not been before cause the already desperate group to panic. One night, days after they should have been back home, Josh disappears. While searching for Josh, Heather and Mike find a derelict house in a clearing and go inside, where they see runic symbols on the wall next to child-sized handprints. Josh's voice seems to be coming from somewhere inside the house, and Mike rushes upstairs. Mike then realizes that the voice is now coming from the basement, and rushes down the steps. Suddenly, Mike is rendered silent and the camera falls. Hysterical, Heather follows and sees Mike in the corner of the room, faced against a wall. Suddenly Heather's camera is knocked down and she too is rendered silent. The film runs for a few seconds, then dies.\n\n===''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' (2000)===\n{{Main|Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2}}\n''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' returns to Maryland's Black Hills region in the wake of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and the prodigious media coverage devoted to its conflation of documentary style and supernatural legend, fans and curiosity-seekers have descended upon the movie's real-life setting of Burkittsville, Maryland. Jeff Patterson ([[Jeffrey Donovan]]), a black-sheep \"townie\" only recently released from a mental institution, has turned his obsession with the Blair Witch into a business and has lured four young people to Burkittsville for a tour of the Witch's purported Black Hills' haunts. Jeff's clients are also fixated on the film, for reasons they themselves may not fully comprehend. Erica Geerson ([[Erica Leerhsen]]) is a practicing Wiccan who has immersed herself in Blair Witch mythology, even though she decries the film's portrayal of her fellow witches. Grad students Tristen Ryler ([[Tristine Skyler]]) and Stephen Ryan Parker ([[Stephen Barker Turner]]) are writing a book about the Blair Witch, but disagree completely about the story's basis in fact, with folklorist Tristen arguing that it must contain some grain of truth while Stephen insists it's a textbook case of mass hysteria. Completing the group is Kim Diamond ([[Kim Director]]), a hard-edged, sardonic Goth aficionado possessed of striking psychic abilities.\n\nAfter spending a strange and disorienting night at one of the most sinister sites in Blair Witch lore, the five campers awake to a scene of destruction and no memory of having gone to sleep. They return to Jeff's abandoned warehouse loft to try to piece together what happened. But as Jeff leads Erica, Tristen, Stephen and Kim across the rickety drawbridge and unlocks the metal door to a chorus of barking dogs, they are entering a place no safer than the woods they just left. Inside, the legend seems to begin to bleed into reality as their mass hysteria ensues. Erica mysteriously disappears and Tristen ends up hanging herself from the second floor railing of the warehouse.\n\nThe end of the film reveals that Jeff, Stephen, and Kim have been arrested. Each is interrogated separately, with the police showing each person footage of their crimes. Security camera footage shows Kim stabbing a cashier in the neck. Surveillance camera footage shows a naked Jeff killing Erica, arranging her clothes, and putting her dead body in the closet. Jeff's video shows Stephen assaulting Tristen, pushing her over the second floor banister, and accusing her of being a witch. All three, close to a nervous breakdown, proclaim their innocence.\n\nThe tie-in [[mockumentary]] to ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Blair Witch]]'', establishes the events of the film being a [[play within a play|film within a film]]; the in-universe mockumentary reveals that ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' is \"a film adaptation\" based on the \"Black Hills murders\" that took place shortly after the release of ''The Blair Witch Project''. ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows \"the real James Patterson\"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case's events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed within the documentary coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole. Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the \"real\" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.\n\n===''Blair Witch'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Blair Witch (film)}}\nOn September 2, 2009, Ed S\u00e1nchez and [[Daniel Myrick]] announced their intent to produce a third ''Blair Witch'' film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eduardo Sanchez Talks Seventh Moon, Plans for Blair Witch 3 |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8187275.stm| title = The legend of the Witch lives on: Interview| accessdate = 2009-08-11| work = news.bbc.co.uk | date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> The film was a sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not reference any of the events from ''Book of Shadows''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Returns?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> In 2011, S\u00e1nchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting Lionsgate to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Project 3 Moves Forward Says Eduardo Sanchez|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-blair-witch-project-3-moves-forward-says-eduardo-sanchez|publisher=Movie Web|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> The film went into [[development hell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Planned Horror Movie Sequels We're Still Waiting to See |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/list/10-planned-horror-movie-sequels-were-still-waiting-see|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy January 2015, a third ''Blair Witch'' was still in talks.

The first being ''Curse of the Blair Witch'' which aired on the [[Syfy Channel]] in 1999, prior to the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'', and the second being ''Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend'' which overlaps quite a bit with ''Curse of the Blair Witch''. The latter two documentaries, ''The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy'' and ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'', both directed by [[Ben Rock]], aired in 2000.\n\n===''Curse of the Blair Witch'' (1999)===\nBefore the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'' in 1999, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] aired a 45-minute mockumentary about the Blair Witch called ''Curse of the Blair Witch''.\n\nThe program offers firsthand interviews with several fictional colleagues and relatives of Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams, including their Montgomery College film professor.\n\nOne of the highlights of the video is the first mention of Elly Kedward, the woman who would go on to become the Blair Witch.\n\n''Curse of the Blair Witch'' was created to give credibility to the idea that the events of ''The Blair Witch Project'' actually occurred, which was how the film was marketed upon its initial release.\n\n===''Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend'' (1999)===\nDirected by [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[Eduardo S\u00e1nchez (director)|Eduardo S\u00e1nchez]], considered for inclusion in the theatrical release of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and released to [[VHS]] as part of a special promotion that ran when ''The Blair Witch Project'' was released on home video, ''Sticks and Stones'' runs 30 minutes and overlaps with the mockumentary ''Curse of the Blair Witch''. The mockumentary primarily consists of alternate cuts of many of the previous films' interviews, but there is some new material to be found, including a brief 1995 conversation with [[Joshua Leonard]]'s father about his son's disappearance.\n\n''Sticks and Stones'' also includes an extended conversation between [[Heather Donahue]] and [[Michael C. Williams|Michael Williams]] from a [[deleted scene]], that was cut from the theatrical release of ''The Blair Witch Project''.\n\n===''The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy'' (2000)===\nWhen ''The Blair Witch Project'' premiered on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], it was accompanied by a new 40-minute Blair Witch mockumentary named ''The Burkittsville 7'', which delved into the murder case of Rustin Parr that was mentioned in ''The Blair Witch Project''. Within the mockumentary it is theorised that Kyle Brody, the lone survivor of the murders, may have himself been involved in the murders. Within the mockumentary, it is mentioned that after Parr was hanged, Brody grew up to become a troubled adult who spent most of the latter part of his life in mental institutions before committing suicide in the year 1971.\n\n===''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' (2000)===\nDirected by [[Ben Rock]], and airing on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in conjunction with the release of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'', the mockumentary ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' takes an objective look at the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2''. Running 45 minutes, it examines the troubled life of \"the real Jeff Patterson\" and his obsession with ''The Blair Witch Project''. Within the documentary, the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are presented as a film adaptation based on the \"Black Hills murders\" that took place shortly after the events of ''The Blair Witch Project''. This documentary presents ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' as a film within a film.\n\n''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows \"the real James Patterson\"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to [[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|fictionalize the case's events for the big screen]]. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the [[Wiccan]] community as a whole.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:99%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n\n* A dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the film or that the character's presence in the film has yet to be announced.\n* A {{note label|unaccredited|U|}} indicates an unaccredited role.\n* A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates an voice-only role.\n* An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates an appearance through archival footage or stills.\n</blockquote>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" score=\"col\" width=\"14.5%\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"3\" | Theatrical films \n! colspan=\"4\" | Mockumentaries\n|-\n! score=\"col\" width=\"14.5%\" | ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"11.5%\" | ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|{{small|Book of Shadows:}}<br>Blair Witch 2]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"7.5%\" | ''[[Curse of the Blair Witch|{{small|Curse of the}}<br>Blair Witch]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend|Sticks and Stones:<br>{{small|An Exploration of the<br>Blair Witch Legend}}]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"17%\" | ''[[The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy|{{small|The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7:}}<br>The Blair Witch Legacy]]''\n! score=\"col\" width=\"8%\" | ''[[Shadow of the Blair Witch|{{small|Shadow of the}}<br>Blair Witch]]''\n|-\n! 1999\n! 2000\n! 2016\n! colspan=\"2\" | 1999\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2000\n|-\n!

Stern compiled ''The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier''. Perpetuating the film's \"true story\" angle, the dossier consisted of fabricated police reports, pictures, interviews, and newspaper articles presenting the movie's premise as fact, as well as further elaboration on the Elly Kedward and Rustin Parr legends. In 2000 D.A. Stern compiled another dossier in the same fashion called ''Blair Witch: Book of Shadows'' (released in November, 2000) regarding the events of the second movie.\n\n==Novels==\nStern wrote the 2000 novel ''Blair Witch: The Secret Confessions of Rustin Parr'' and in 2004, revisited the franchise with the novel ''Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift'', featuring all original characters and plot.\n\nIn May 1999, a [[Photonovel]] adaptation of ''The Blair Witch Project'' was written by Claire Forbes and was released by Fotonovel Publications.\n\n===''The Blair Witch Files''===\nA series of eight young adult books entitled ''The Blair Witch Files'' were released by [[Random House|Random]] subsidiary [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] from 2000 to 2001.

Several examples were built for this role, as well as a small batch to be used in the long-range [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]] role.\n\n==Development and design==\nThe design started in response to a [[1936 in aviation|1936]] request by [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Lufthansa]], which planned a route over the [[Pamir Mountains]] in [[Afghanistan]]. This was the primary difficulty in producing an aircraft able to meet the range requirements, because the aircraft would have to lift its large fuel load to {{cvt|7600|m}} to clear the mountains. At the time there were simply no engines available with that sort of altitude performance, although [[Hirth]] was working on one in the {{cvt|500|hp|order=flip}} class. The [[G\u00fcnter brothers]] proposed to adapt their basic [[Heinkel He 70|He 70]] ''Blitz'' airframe to carry four of these engines to provide enough power for the massive fuel load.\n\nThe He 116 would use a modified version of the He 70's two-spar elliptical planform, skinned (like the He 70) with plywood. The fuselage was all-new, consisting of a [[semi-monocoque]] [[duralumin]] body with watertight bulkheads in case the aircraft were forced down over water. The design shared enough construction with the He 70 that the first prototype '''He 116 V1''' was completed in early [[1937 in aviation|1937]]. The new engines were not ready at this point, so the prototype was instead fitted with the much smaller [[Hirth HM 508C]] of {{cvt|240|hp|order=flip}}. \n[[File:Heinkel He 116 photo L'Aerophile October 1937.jpg|right|thumb|V2 ''Schlesien'' D-JAIE, in flight]]\n==Registrations names and designations==\n;V1 ''L\u00fcbeck'':apparently remained unregistered.\n;V2 ''Schlesien'' D-JAIE:  operated by [[Lufthansa]].\n;V3 ''Rostok'' D-ARFD: (He-116A-03 / He 116R) the third proototype modified for record breaking long-distance flights.\n;V4 ''Hamburg'' D-ATIO: (He 116A-02)  operated by [[Lufthansa]].\n;V5 ''Nogi'' J-BAKD: Delivered on 29 April 1938  to [[Japan]] in a six-day flight covering {{cvt|15,251|km|mi nmi}} in 54 hours 17 minutes of flight time.

Six additional aircraft based on the V7 pattern were then ordered, designated '''He 116B-0''', although they also received prototype numbers V9 to V14. The B-0 s were intended to operate at extremely long range, outside the range of enemy fighters, and therefore had no defensive armament fitted. All eight (V7 through V14) were issued to reconnaissance units prior to the war, but by that time the idea of a slow-moving unarmed plane providing any useful information seemed unlikely. Instead they were used over German territory providing mapping services.\n\n;He 116R:'''V3''' was removed from the line to be converted into a record-breaking prototype. The modifications included a larger {{cvt|75.6|m2}} wing with a {{cvt|25|m}} span, and increased fuel tankage in the fuselage. The {{cvt|240|hp|order=flip}} [[Hirth HM 508|Hirth HM 508H]] engines provided a better fuel economy through operation at lower rpm. For take-offs with maximum fuel the '''He 116R''', ''Rostock'', was fitted with four [[RATO]] units. On its first record flight attempt one of the rockets tore loose and hit the wing, requiring extensive repairs.

White [[wheat]]-flour bread has long been the prestige [[starch]], but historically, most people ate bread, flatcakes, or [[porridge]] made from [[rye]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], and [[oat]]s.<ref>Alfio Cortonesi, \"Self-sufficiency and the Market: Rural and Urban Diet in the Middle Ages\", in Jean-Louis Flandrin, Massimo Montanari, ''Food: A Culinary History from Antiquity to the Present'', 1999, {{isbn|0231111541}}, p. 268ff</ref><ref>Michel Morineau, \"Growing without Knowing Why: Production, Demographics, and Diet\", in Jean-Louis Flandrin, Massimo Montanari, ''Food: A Culinary History from Antiquity to the Present'', 1999, {{isbn|0231111541}}, p. 380ff</ref> The better-off also made [[pasta]], [[dumpling]]s and [[Pastry|pastries]]. The [[potato]] has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the [[European colonisation of the Americas]]. [[Maize]] is much less common in most European diets than it is in the [[Americas]]; however, corn meal ([[polenta]] or [[m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103]]) is a major part of the cuisine of [[Italy]] and the [[Balkans]]. Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as [[pizza]] or [[tarte flamb\u00e9e]]) and rice are eaten in Europe, they are only staple foods in limited areas, particularly in Southern Europe.  [[Salad]]s (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables with sauce) are an integral part of European cuisine.\n\nFormal European dinners are served in distinct courses. European presentation evolved from [[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]], or bringing multiple dishes to the table at once, into [[service \u00e0 la russe]], where dishes are presented sequentially. Usually, cold, hot and savoury, and sweet dishes are served strictly separately in this order, as [[hors d'oeuvre]] (appetizer) or soup, as [[entr\u00e9e]] and [[main course]], and as [[dessert]]. Dishes that are both sweet and savoury were common earlier in ancient Roman cuisine, but are today uncommon, with sweet dishes being served only as dessert. A service where the guests are free to take food by themselves is termed a [[buffet]], and is usually restricted to parties or holidays. Nevertheless, guests are expected to follow the same pattern.\n\nHistorically, European cuisine has been developed in the European royal and noble courts. European nobility was usually arms-bearing and lived in separate manors in the countryside. The knife was the primary eating implement ([[cutlery]]), and eating steaks and other foods that require cutting followed. In contrast in the Sinosphere, the ruling class were the court officials, who had their food cut ready to eat in the kitchen, to be eaten with chopsticks. The knife was supplanted by the [[spoon]] for soups, while the [[fork]] was introduced later in the [[early modern period]], ca. 16th century. Today, most dishes are intended to be eaten with cutlery and only a few [[finger food]]s can be eaten with the hands in polite company.\n\n==Central European cuisines==\n{{See also|Central European cuisine}}\nAll of these countries have their specialities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visiteurope.com/Discover/Where-To-Go/Central-Europe/Cuisine-Central-Europe |title=Cuisine from Central Europe |access-date=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083222/http://www.visiteurope.com/Discover/Where-To-Go/Central-Europe/Cuisine-Central-Europe |archive-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=dead |website=Visit Europe }}</ref> Austria is famous for their Wiener Schnitzel - a breaded veal cutlet served with a slice of lemon, the Czech Republic for their world renowned beers.

Over six seasons at the club, Dickov experienced two [[promotion and relegation|promotions]] and two relegations, playing in three different divisions. Dickov left in 2002 to join [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he stayed for two seasons and, in 2004, he signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and was part of the team which qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]]. Upon the expiry of his Blackburn contract in 2006, he rejoined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and later went on to play for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 2000, he made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. In total he represented his country ten times, scoring one goal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Arsenal===\nBorn in [[Livingston, West Lothian]],<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> Paul started playing football around the age of nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he caught the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Dickov joined the youth ranks of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] chances were limited for Dickov as he struggled to break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as [[Ian Wright]]. He helped the club win the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1994, and beforehand he had been a member of Arsenal's squad during its first season in the [[Premier League]]. Whilst at [[Highbury]] he spent several loan spells at both [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.\n\n===Manchester City===\nDickov joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 22 August 1996 in a transfer valued between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31 million,<ref name=\"James\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0}}p218.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Dickov| publisher=Manchester City F.C. | url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502| accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012017/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> the final signing of [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]]'s Manchester City management.

Dickov made his first Manchester City start in the next match, in a 2\u20131 win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref>James, p461</ref> Dickov joined the club in a period of turmoil; in his first season at Manchester City he played under five different managers (three full-time appointments and two caretakers). A regular starter under [[Asa Hartford]], [[Steve Coppell]] and [[Phil Neal]], he played less frequently under [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], and finished the season with five goals from 25 League starts. At the start of the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season, Dickov did not feature in the first team, but was restored to the starting line-up following injuries to [[Uwe R\u00f6sler]] and [[Lee Bradbury]]. Dickov finished the season as the City's top scorer with nine goals, but the club were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history after finishing in 22nd place.\n\nDickov, wearing the number 9 shirt, played a supporting role in a striking partnership with [[Shaun Goater]] in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. After a slow start, his form improved in the later part of the season, leading to City manager Joe Royle nicknaming him \"the crocus\" due to him coming to life in the spring months.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/dickov-a-mixture-of-light-and-dark-72387.html |title=Dickov - A mixture of dark and light |publisher = [[the Independent]] |date = 9 January 2004}}</ref>\nHe scored an important equaliser against [[Wigan Athletic]] in the play off semi final first leg (which was also the last ever goal to be scored at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dickov-keeps-city-in-the-hunt-1094115.html |title=Dickov keeps City in the hunt |publisher=[[the Independent]] |date=15 May 1999 |accessdate=19 April 2010 | location=London | first=Dave | last=Hadfield}}</ref> The sixteenth goal was particularly crucial, a 15-yard, top corner injury time equaliser in the final of the promotion playoffs against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]].

One of these substitute appearances was the final match of the season, a 4\u20131 win at Blackburn. Dickov scored the fourth Manchester City goal as City clinched [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League.\n\nWhen Manchester City returned to the Premier League for the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]] season, it appeared that Dickov's chances of playing would be limited as City signed former [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] [[George Weah]] and [[Costa Rica]]n international [[Paulo Wanchope]]. However, Dickov earned a place in the team, his performances attracting the attention of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] manager [[Craig Brown (footballer born 1940)|Craig Brown]], who called him up to the Scotland squad for the first time.\n\nCity were relegated back into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] season and [[Kevin Keegan]] replaced [[Joe Royle]] as manager. Dickov found his first team opportunities at the club limited especially as the team had other strikers such as [[Paulo Wanchope]], [[Shaun Goater]] and [[Darren Huckerby]].

[[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].\n\nDickov played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1990 to 2011, starting his career with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he won the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1994, but often struggled to hold a place in the first team and spent time on loan with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] before moving to  [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1996 who were then in [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. Over six seasons at the club, Dickov experienced two [[promotion and relegation|promotions]] and two relegations, playing in three different divisions. Dickov left in 2002 to join [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he stayed for two seasons and, in 2004, he signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and was part of the team which qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]]. Upon the expiry of his Blackburn contract in 2006, he rejoined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and later went on to play for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 2000, he made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. In total he represented his country ten times, scoring one goal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Arsenal===\nBorn in [[Livingston, West Lothian]],<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> Paul started playing football around the age of nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he caught the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Dickov joined the youth ranks of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] chances were limited for Dickov as he struggled to break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as [[Ian Wright]]. He helped the club win the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1994, and beforehand he had been a member of Arsenal's squad during its first season in the [[Premier League]]. Whilst at [[Highbury]] he spent several loan spells at both [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.\n\n===Manchester City===\nDickov joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 22 August 1996 in a transfer valued between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31 million,<ref name=\"James\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0}}p218.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Dickov| publisher=Manchester City F.C. | url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502| accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012017/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> the final signing of [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]]'s Manchester City management.

A regular starter under [[Asa Hartford]], [[Steve Coppell]] and [[Phil Neal]], he played less frequently under [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], and finished the season with five goals from 25 League starts. At the start of the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season, Dickov did not feature in the first team, but was restored to the starting line-up following injuries to [[Uwe R\u00f6sler]] and [[Lee Bradbury]]. Dickov finished the season as the City's top scorer with nine goals, but the club were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history after finishing in 22nd place.\n\nDickov, wearing the number 9 shirt, played a supporting role in a striking partnership with [[Shaun Goater]] in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. After a slow start, his form improved in the later part of the season, leading to City manager Joe Royle nicknaming him \"the crocus\" due to him coming to life in the spring months.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/dickov-a-mixture-of-light-and-dark-72387.html\n|title=Dickov - A mixture of dark and light \n|publisher = [[the Independent]]\n|date = 9 January 2004}}</ref>\nHe scored an important equaliser against [[Wigan Athletic]] in the play off semi final first leg (which was also the last ever goal to be scored at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]]).<ref>{{cite news \n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dickov-keeps-city-in-the-hunt-1094115.html\n|title=Dickov keeps City in the hunt\n|publisher=[[the Independent]] \n|date=15 May 1999 |accessdate=19 April 2010\n| location=London\n| first=Dave\n| last=Hadfield}}</ref> The sixteenth goal was particularly crucial, a 15-yard, top corner injury time equaliser in the final of the promotion playoffs against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]].

He is surprised to see his younger brother Michael Scofield in the same prison and who\nis planning to break him out of prison before his execution. He evaded authorities after escaping from prison and has been exonerated of all charges.  In the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Lincoln, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. When they fail to retrieve L. J. Burrows before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. In season 3 he currently free and successfully assisted Michael and [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]] to break out of Sona. As of season 4, he is now part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company.\nHe is also in the very last scene when he visits Michael Scofield's (his brother) grave, and he puts an origami crane on top of the grave so he can remember the time when he made them for him, so he would always know that his brother was caring for him. \nIn season 5, he finds out Michael is still alive and incarcerated in Yemen, and leads an operation to save his brother.\n\nPurcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast.<ref name=\"TVGuide-2006aug08\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Prison-Break-DVD-38536.aspx |title=Prison Break DVD News, Season 2 Preview! |accessdate=17 January 2009 |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |date=8 August 2006 |work=TV Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313111139/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Prison-Break-DVD-38536.aspx |archivedate=13 March 2009 }}</ref> He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on ''[[North Shore (TV series)|North Shore]]''.\n\n=== Michael Scofield ===\n{{see also|Michael Scofield}} \n'''Michael Scofield''' (played by  [[Wentworth Miller]]) is the protagonist of the series and younger brother of [[Lincoln Burrows]]. He designs an elaborate escape plan and tattoos it to his body to free his older brother who has been framed for murder and sentenced to death via the electric chair. He successfully executes this plan, freeing himself, Lincoln and 6 other convicts, but ultimately fails to evade the police in Panama. In the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Michael, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. When they fail to retrieve L. J. Burrows before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. Michael and Lincoln travel together, after the fugitives separate to accomplish each of their individual goals. Season 3 is centered around Michael breaking out of prison again, however, this time from the self-governed prison of Sona, situated in Panama. In season 4, he reunites with Sara after discovering her death in season 3 was faked, and she is part of Agent Donald Self's covert \"A-Team\", which is assembled to bring down [[The Company (Prison Break)|The Company]]. Michael has low latent inhibition, a personality trait which allows him to notice things that others would not. This, along with his genius-level intellect, is what enabled him to break out of both prisons. He also suffers from a tumor of the hypothalamus, which causes nosebleeds, disorientation, and extreme pain. In season 5, he is revealed to be incarcerated in Yemen under a different name; Kaniel Outis. It is gradually revealed that Michael, along with a fellow prisoner named Whip, are undercover CIA operatives, but were betrayed by a mastermind agent known as Poseidon.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Veronica Donovan ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image                =\n| caption              = \n| name                 = Veronica Donovan\n| first  = \"[[Pilot (Prison Break)|Pilot]]\" (2005)\n| last = \"[[Manhunt (Prison Break)|Manhunt]]\" (2006)\n| creator = [[Paul Scheuring]]\n| portrayer            = [[Robin Tunney]]<br />Annie Yokom (young)\n| occupation           = Lawyer\n| family               = \n| significant_others    = Sebastian Balfour <br />[[Lincoln Burrows]]\n}}\n'''Veronica Donovan''' (played by  [[Robin Tunney]]) is a real-estate lawyer and a longtime friend of the protagonists of the series, who unsuccessfully tries to find evidence to exonerate Lincoln Burrows. She serves as the primary ally of the brothers in the show's first season. Veronica had a relationship with Lincoln in High School and the two also dated each other after she graduated from Baylor law school. However, at the start of the show they have broken up since several years. When Lincoln is first framed for the murder of Terrence Steadman, Veronica assumes that he is guilty and moves on with her life. Sometime between the episode \"[[Brother's Keeper (Prison Break episode)|Brother's Keeper]]\",  and the pilot, she gets engaged to Sebastian Balfour. Although she is a real estate lawyer and not a criminal lawyer, Veronica defends her childhood friend, Michael Scofield at his trial. Initially, she doesn't believe Lincoln's innocence and is convinced by the security tape footage. However, after the disappearance of Leticia Barris, a witness who could prove Lincoln's innocence and the death of a bishop who opposed Lincoln's death penalty, Veronica is led to believe that Lincoln might have been set up. Thus, Michael's arrest causes her to grow more involved with Lincoln's case, straining her relationship with Sebastian. Following the disappearance of Leticia in the episode \"Cell Test\", Veronica decides to postpone the wedding as she claims that she can\u2019t focus on it at the time. Sebastian is hurt by this and breaks off the engagement.\n\nShe approaches ''Project Justice'' for help with Lincoln's case, knowing that she herself doesn't have any experience in death penalty cases. However, they refuse to partake in her case. [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Nick Savrinn|Nick Savrinn]] later offers his help after telling her that his father was similarly accused of a crime he did not commit. Together, they work tirelessly, trying to uncover the truth behind Terrence Steadman's apparent murder. The original security tape which they were looking for is destroyed and in the subsequent episode, \"[[Riots, Drills and the Devil#Part 2|Riots, Drills and the Devil Part 2]]\", they are threatened via a public phone call in Washington, D.C. and are targeted by [[Paul Kellerman]] and [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Other conspiracy characters|Daniel Hale]], who are members of the conspiracy. They were nearly killed by an explosion in Veronica's apartment and in the following episodes, [[list of Prison Break characters#Lincoln \"L.J.\" Burrows|LJ Burrows]] joins both of them after escaping from the agent's clutches. All three of them go into hiding. Their lives are once again in danger when an assassin called Agent Quinn manages to find out their secret location. Veronica eventually manages to knock him unconscious and escape with LJ and a wounded Nick. Veronica is then contacted by a secret informant, who claims to be willing to provide information. Knowing that hiding is not the answer, Veronica decides to go out into the open and reveal the conspiracy to the public. Veronica meets with the informant, agent Hale, the following night, where he reveals that Steadman is still alive. Hale is executed by Kellerman before he can provide proof, and Veronica barely has time to hide shortly before Kellerman arrives.\n\nNow left more or less empty handed, Veronica and Nick nevertheless goes back to the court on Lincoln's execution day for one last time to appeal for Lincoln's case, but this ultimately fails as the judge rules against them. Fortunately, someone slips in evidence in the last minute which helps to stall Lincoln's execution. Veronica and Nick decide to send someone to do a test on Steadman's body, but the dental records matched Steadman's past records. Following this, she decides to find out where the real Steadman is hiding. In \"J-Cat\", Nick, Veronica and L.J. return to [[New Glarus, Wisconsin|New Glarus]] to visit the dead Quinn, where they obtain his cell phone. Eventually, they found out Terrence Steadman's hideout in Blackfoot, Montana. However, at the end of the episode \"Tonight\", Veronica is betrayed by Nick, who turned out to have made a deal with John Abruzzi to have her \"ready and waiting\" at the airport on the night of the escape in exchange for his father's freedom. Nick is conflicted, however, and ultimately lets her go to the airport as he doesn't want Veronica to be killed. Now alone, she travels to Blackfoot, Montana and manages to sneak into Steadman's house and confront him face to face.\n\nIn season 2, following her confrontation with Steadman ([[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]]), Veronica is executed in cold blood by secret service agents ordered to ensure that Terrence Steadman is kept hidden. Veronica becomes the first main character to be killed off in the series.\n\n=== John Abruzzi ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series               = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour               = #cccfff\n| name                 = John Abruzzi\n| first  = \"[[Pilot (Prison Break)|Pilot]]\" (2005)\n| last = \"[[First Down (Prison Break)|First Down]]\" (2006)\n| portrayer            = [[Peter Stormare]]\n| creator = [[Paul Scheuring]]\n| occupation           = Don of the Abruzzi Family of the Chicago Mafia\n| family               = {{Plainlist|\n* Nicole Abruzzi (daughter)\n* John Abruzzi, Jr (son)\n* Luca Abruzzi (son)\n}}\n| spouse       = Sylvia Abruzzi\n}}\n'''John Abruzzi''' (played by  [[Peter Stormare]]) is an [[Italian-American]] mob boss and the Don of the Abruzzi crime family, who is imprisoned at Fox River with a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]]. He controls Prison Industry, an internal work program for the convicts, thanks to his connections with [[Brad Bellick]], who is on the payroll of Abruzzi's associates. He appears as an anti-hero where he is less of an antagonist than an unwanted ally to the protagonists. He is convicted based on the testimony of Otto Fibonacci, who saw him order the deaths of two men. Abruzzi plans to exact revenge on Fibonacci, who entered the witness protection program. In the pilot episode, he is approached by Michael Scofield with a PI membership request. Abruzzi at first dismisses the newcomer, but gives him his full attention after he learns that Michael somehow knows where Fibonacci is hiding. Although Michael claims that he will give up the information in exchange for help with his escape plan, Abruzzi has two of Michael's toes cut off trying to extract Fibonacci's location from him. This fails and Abruzzi decides to instead team up with Michael to break out of prison. Although their alliance is initially unstable, with both men being wary of each other, Abruzzi and Michael learn to get along as the season progresses. Abruzzi's status as head of PI proves valuable to Michael's escape plan, as the escape team is able to use work on PI to build an escape tunnel.\n\nFor some time, the escape plan is threatened when Abruzzi's associate on the outside, Philly Falzone, cuts off Abruzzi's cash stream and takes his prison privileges from him as payback for failing to find Fibonacci. Together, Michael and Abruzzi decides to frame Falzone in the episode \"Sleight of Hand\", allowing Abruzzi to restore his control of PI. When fellow escapee T-Bag becomes an obstacle, Abruzzi has one of his men on the outside kidnap T-Bag's cousin. The job goes bad, resulting in the death of the cousin as well as his young son. Abruzzi is deeply shaken over the death of the toddler and turns to religion as an outlet for his pain, causing him to spare T-Bag's life even though he had intended to kill him. This proves to be a big mistake, as T-Bag immediately takes the opportunity to slash Abruzzi's throat. He is evacuated by helicopter to receive treatment for his injuries. Abruzzi survives and returns six episodes later in \"The Key\". Upon his return he appears to have become very religious and friendly; it is soon discovered to be a ploy, as Abruzzi ruthlessly plans to kill most of the team and arranges to kidnap [[Veronica Donovan]] to force Fibonacci's location out of Michael, although this fails since Nick Savrinn released Veronica. After the escape, Abruzzi attempts to gun down T-Bag, but he handcuffs himself to Michael to avoid getting shot at. Abruzzi exacts revenge on T-Bag, cutting off his left hand with an axe, the one he attached himself to Michael with. He is one of the group of five who are forced to run on foot after his plane leaves them behind.\n\nAbruzzi appears only briefly in season 2. After being on the run with the other four escapees, he separates from the group and reunites with his family in New York. No longer interested in finding out Fibonacci's location, he plans to flee with his family to Sardinia. He had a sudden change of mind when, one of his thugs informs him about Fibonacci's exact location, but is instead lured into a trap set up by Mahone and the [[FBI]], using Fibonacci as bait. Rather choosing death over returning to prison, Abruzzi raises his weapon and is gunned down, with a cross in hand. He is the first member of the Fox River Eight to be taken down by the authorities.\n\nIn season 5, he is revealed to have an older son who did not appear in the original series, named Luca Abruzzi, who Lincoln began working for.\n;Production details\n\nPeter Stormare, Abruzzi's portrayer, was a member of the regular cast and was featured in every episode before his character's injury in the thirteenth episode of the first season, \"[[End of the Tunnel (Prison Break episode)|End of the Tunnel]]\". After his return to the series six episodes later in \"[[The Key (Prison Break episode)|The Key]]\", Stormare became a recurring guest star, appearing in the final four episodes of the first season and in the first, second and fourth episodes of the second season. The character was later killed off in the fourth episode of the second season, \"[[First Down (Prison Break episode)|First Down]]\". He later appeared in a brief flashback in the episode \"[[Fin Del Camino]].\"\n\n=== Fernando Sucre ===\n{{see also|Fernando Sucre}} \n'''Fernando Sucre''' (played by  [[Amaury Nolasco]]) is imprisoned at [[Fox River State Penitentiary]] for aggravated robbery and was ratted out by the man trying to steal his girlfriend. Sucre is Michael's cell mate and was one of the first members of the escape plan. Although the group split apart after the escape Sucre came back to help Michael multiple times. He is part of Self's \"A-Team\" and plays an important role in getting Scylla.\nIn season 5, he is revealed to now be working on a freighter, and wants to help save Michael from Yemen.\n\n=== Lincoln \"L.

In the pilot episode, despite his normally good behavior, L.J. is arrested for drug possession and put on probation. Part of his punishment is to visit a mentor, his father, once weekly. The first encounter is cold, but their relationship grows warmer, However, L.J. is targeted by conspiracy agents [[Paul Kellerman]] and [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Other conspiracy characters|Daniel Hale]]; after they frame him for the murders of his [[Lisa Rix|mother]] and [[Adrian Rix|stepfather]], L.

In season 2, L.J. is visited in jail by [[Alexander Mahone]], who asks for his help to capture Lincoln and Michael; L.J. refuses to co-operate. His family nearly breaks him out of the courthouse, but the escape is foiled and L.J. is sent to an adult detention center. He is later set free in a move by The Company to find Lincoln. Though they are able to outsmart the agents and escape, they are arrested by the police in \"[[Unearthed (Prison Break episode)|Unearthed]]\". They are later saved by people working for Lincoln's father, and L. J. is sent with his grandfather's friend Jane for safety.\n\nIn [[Wash (Prison Break episode)|\"Wash\"]] L.J. is revealed to be living in [[Pullman, Washington]] under a false name. This ends in season 3, where L.J is kidnapped by The Company and held hostage as motivation for Lincoln and Michael to break Whistler out of Sona. After Whistler is broken out, the hostage exchange is successful at a museum, and L.J. is reunited with his father. L.J. appears briefly in the season 4 [[Scylla (Prison Break episode)|premiere]] and is briefly mentioned in the epilogue of the series finale when Lincoln says that L.J. is taking his finals in school, implying that wherever he is, he is doing well. L.J. does not appear in season 5, nor is he mentioned.\n\n=== Brad Bellick ===\n{{see also|Brad Bellick}}\nBrad Bellick (played by  [[Wade Williams]]) is the leader of the Fox River State Penitentiary correctional officers but is later dismissed. He goes after [[Charles Westmoreland]]'s hidden five million dollars, but fails. Set up for murder twice by T-Bag, he ended up incarcerated at Sona. He later escaped from Sona between Season's 3 and 4 along with Sucre and T-Bag. After his escape he was recruited to be part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company.

He escapes with Michael's help and reconnects with his previous family by kidnapping them. He frees them after an emotional outbreak, however. He goes to Panama and ends up in Sona for killing a number of prostitutes. T-Bag took over Sona after killing its former ruler, Lechero. However, sometime between season 3 and 4, he has broken out of Sona along with Sucre and Bellick and is now on a mission to head back to the US to settle the score with Michael for double-crossing him on the escape from Sona at the end of season 3. He later is forced to be a reluctant member of Self's \"A-Team\".\nIn season 5, he is released from Fox River and given an operation which gives him a prosthetic hand as functional as a natural one. he is also given a photo which shows Michael is still alive in Yemen, and becomes an unwanted ally of Sara. Though Bagwell initially believed himself to be incapable of fathering a child due to being conceived as a result of inbreeding, Michael reveals to him that he has an illegitimate son in David \"Whip\" Martin. The chance for a fresh start and family serves as T-Bag's motivation for continuing to assist Michael. When Whip is killed, T-Bag snaps the neck of his killer; and as a result finds himself imprisoned in Fox River; where he exacts further vengeance upon Poseidon, who is assigned his cellmate.\n\n=== Sara Tancredi ===\n{{see also|Sara Tancredi}}\nSara Tancredi (played by  [[Sarah Wayne Callies]]) is Michael's love interest, daughter of the Illinois governor, and a doctor working at Fox River State Penitentiary before becoming involved in the conspiracy behind Lincoln Burrows' setup. She eventually shoots a corrupt government agent, [[William Kim]], and Michael takes the fall for it, giving her freedom. Apparently brutally decapitated, her head was placed in the box at the beginning of season 3, though it was later discovered to be a ploy and she is in fact alive. As of season 4, she was part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company.\nIn season 5, she has remarried, is raising Michael's son alongside her husband, and is somewhat reluctant to believe Michael is still alive.\n\n=== Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin ===\n{{see also|Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin}}\nBenjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin (played by  [[Rockmond Dunbar]]) is imprisoned at Fox River for possession of stolen goods.<ref>\n[http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/bios/bio_franklin.htm Character biography of Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin] at Prison Break's official site.</ref> He escapes prison and reconnects successfully with his family. All charges against him are dropped after he reveals certain secrets about [[Alexander Mahone]]. He and his family are safe and were then put in witness protection at the end of season 2. C-Note returns at the end of season 4 with Sucre to help Michael, Lincoln & the rest of the team against The Company.\nIn season 5, he accompanies Lincoln to Yemen after finding evidence that Michael is still alive.\n\n=== Alexander Mahone ===\n{{see also|Alexander Mahone}}\nAlexander Mahone (played by  [[William Fichtner]]) is an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent, who is put in charge of the nationwide manhunt for the Fox River escapees. He is responsible for the deaths of three of the Fox River Eight. In turn, Michael sets him up for possession of cocaine, which leads to his incarceration at Sona, as well. He escaped from Sona with Michael and Whistler at the end of season 3, and is now part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company in season 4. He does not appear in Season 5, nor is he mentioned.\n\n=== James Whistler ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = James Whistler\n| portrayer          = [[Chris Vance (actor)|Chris Vance]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = \"[[Scylla (Prison Break episode)|Scylla]]\" (2008)\n| alias              = McFadden <br> Gary Miller <br> Cole Pfeiffer\n| significant_other  = Sofia Lugo \n| family             = [[Aldo Burrows]] (grandfather) <br> [[Christina Rose Scofield]] (grandmother) <br> [[Michael Scofield]] (half-uncle) <br> [[Sara Tancredi]] (half-sister-in-law) <br> [[Lincoln Burrows]] (father) <br> Lisa Rix (mother) <br> Michael Scofield Jr. (half-cousin)\n| origin             = [[Australia]]\n}}\nLittle is known about his background, though throughout [[List of Prison Break episodes|season three]] James Whistler (played by [[Chris Vance (actor)|Chris Vance]]) repeatedly claimed to be a simple fisherman from [[Kalbarri, Western Australia]] who ran charters between Panama and the Pacific North West.<ref>Dialogue spoken by Chris Vance as James Whistler, \"[[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]]\", Prison Break season 3 episode 4.</ref>\n\nHe is in the Panamanian jail known as Sona for the murder of the son of the [[mayor]] of [[Panama City]] during a bar fight, although he claims he is innocent. This resulted in a bounty being placed on his head, as the mayor offered to free (via a corrupt judge) any inmate who would kill Whistler, forcing Whistler to go into hiding in the sewers after he arrived at the prison.<ref>Dialogue spoken by [[Carlo Alban]] as McGrady, \"[[Fire/Water]]\", Prison Break season 3 episode 3.</ref> His only contact with the outside world was his girlfriend [[Sofia Lugo|Sof\u00eda]], who obliviously believes in his innocence. Breaking him out of Sona became Michael Scofield's primary mission during season three, though Whistler and his mysterious background causes tension between both men as various aspects of Whistler's background (most notably the story that he is needed to be freed in order to deliver vaguely explained \"coordinates\" recorded within a bird watcher guidebook Whistler carries with him at all times) cause Michael to question whether or not he is helping an innocent man caught in the vast web of conspiracies of The Company, as Whistler claims to be.\n\nHe is first seen in [[Orientaci\u00f3n]] hiding within a crawlspace below the room of [[Lechero]], the de facto leader of the prison. When he first saw [[Brad Bellick]], he offered him food in return for a favor. When a fight broke out between two inmates (one of whom was Michael Scofield) Bellick was to place a note on each of the two inmates in order to get more food from Whistler. He was apparently attempting to send a message to [[Sofia Lugo]]. Sof\u00eda found the note, which read \"VERSAILLES 1989 V MADRID\", and lead her to a bank lock-box containing what appeared to be a bird guide. The book was then stolen by Lincoln Burrows.\n\nThe Company seems to have an interest in Whistler, and this is apparently the reason Michael's incarceration in Sona was arranged in the first place. Due to the political spotlight on him, The Company were unable to get him out. Initially, Whistler is seemingly unaware of why The Company wants him. One of The Company's operatives, Elliott Pike, approached Michael and offered their support if he breaks Whistler out. When he refused, another operative, who called herself only by the obviously false name [[Susan B. Anthony (Prison Break character)|Susan B. Anthony]], approached Michael's brother Lincoln Burrows and informed them that Lincoln's son [[L.J. Burrows]] and Michael's girlfriend [[Sara Tancredi]] were being held hostage by The Company and would be killed if Michael didn't break Whistler out within a week.\n\nAfter the [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head and his location is discovered by both Michael and [[Alexander Mahone|Mahone]], Mahone delivers him to prison boss Lechero. Fortunately, Lechero chooses to remove the bounty on Whistler at Michael's request, giving up the reward of freedom from the mayor, after Michael restores water to the prison. Whistler tries to befriend Mahone in an effort to get information on Scofield. Later he reveals why The Company is interested in him. They want to know where Whistler took a certain naturalist to during one of his charters. But he needs the bird guide, which is actually his trip log to retrace his steps and take The Company to that location.\n\nIn [[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]] the bird guide is returned to him with the warning that he is running out of time. Meanwhile, he asks Sof\u00eda to look into Scofield and Burrows because he doesn't trust any of them. Also he tells Sof\u00eda The Company is interested in him because of a charter he did in [[Seattle]]. Michael instructs Whistler to spy on one of the tower guards to learn their behavior. Whistler observes a window of 6 minutes where the sun's glare forces the guard to look away. When it is revealed he covers for Michael by claiming to be a bird lover. Meanwhile, a new inmate, Tyge claims to know him, calling him by the name McFadden and seeing him in 1997 in [[Nice]] at the [[Ambassador]] [[hotel]], thus casting doubt on his story in Michael's eyes.\n\nTyge is murdered and Whistler is suspected after McGrady tips off Lechero that the two had an argument. His life is in danger until Michael manages to intervene. In [[Vamonos]] it is later revealed that Whistler has been deceitful with Michael, and has actually been working with Gretchen (Susan B. Anthony), and that it is he who is orchestrating his break from Sona. Susan aka Gretchen tells him the plan Bang and Burn is in effect, which both dismissed as suicide until [[Pad Man (character)|Pad Man]] says it is the only option after Michael failed to take James out of Sona. While James gets to the roof of Sona during a military [[helicopter]] rescue of him, Michael Scofield, knowing his position is dead without him, stops the prison break. Scofield was then taken away to confess what he knew about the helicopter squad.\n\nScofield's confession caused Whistler to be implicated. In the subsequent torture, Whistler revealed Gretchen Morgan, the woman who had been orchestrating the entire escape. After learning that Gretchen escaped from the Sona guards clutches, both Whistler and Scofield returned to Sona. Whistler, Michael, Mahone, and McGrady later escape from Sona, Lechero is shot and injured, while [[T-Bag]] and [[Bellick]] are caught during the escape. He realizes he lost his book during his escape. After getting out of Sona, Whistler manages to escape from Michael and Lincoln but is then caught again. The exchange for L.J. and him goes well, but it is realized there never were coordinates in the bird book. He tries to explain to Sof\u00eda, but at this point she wants nothing to do with him. He escapes with Gretchen and The Company. He is later seen making a deal with Mahone to join up with The Company and Mahone, Gretchen, and he drives away.\n\nWhistler appears briefly in the season 4 premiere. After he betrays The Company by planning to steal Scylla, he is shot and killed by Company hitman Wyatt. A later episode reveals that he had arranged to sell Scylla to the Chinese, rather than handing it over to the government.\n\n=== Norman \"Lechero\" St. John ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = Norman St. John \n| portrayer          =  [[Robert Wisdom]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = \"[[The Art of the Deal (Prison Break episode)|The Art of the Deal]]\" (2007)\n| alias              = Lechero\n| occupation  = Drug kingpin\n| family             = Unnamed deceased mother\n| significant_other =  Mary Francis\n| origin             = [[Panama]]\n}}\nNorman St. John (played by  [[Robert Wisdom]]) is a Panamanian drug kingpin incarcerated at Sona, where he is the leader of the prison and is at the top of the prison hierarchy. He appears only in season 3 where his role is similar of that of John Abruzzi in season 1. Ruthless and violent, he earned the nickname \"Lechero\" when he, at the age of 13, disguised himself as a lechero (milkman) in order to kill his mother's rapist. The character serves as an antagonist and enemy to the protagonists in the early episodes of season 3, but later becomes an uneasy ally. Lechero is introduced in the season 3 premiere episode [[Orientacion (Prison Break episode)|Orientacion]]. Aware of Michael Scofield's ventures as a fugitive from the United States, Lechero views him as a threat to his rule and plots to get rid of him by setting Michael up in a fight to the death with another prisoner. However, Michael survives. Lechero also meets [[Theodore Bagwell|T-Bag]] in this episode and accepts him as his underling. The relationship between him and Michael continues to be characterized by deceit and mistrust in the next few episodes, like in [[Call Waiting (Prison Break episode)|Call Waiting]], when Michael steals Lechero's cell phone. But Lechero learns in [[Fire/Water (Prison Break episode)|Fire/Water]], that Michael can be useful as well when he restores water to the prison. Lechero grows increasingly paranoid as the season progresses, and is later tricked by T-Bag that his cronies are planning a coup against him, successfully manipulating Lechero to enlist T-Bag as a spy.\n\nIn [[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]], Lechero gets in trouble when the electrical system in the prison stops functioning. Remembering that Michael is an engineer, he quickly enlists Michael's help to fix the system, in exchange for a new cell in the prison block. He is later approached by Bellick, who warns him that Michael cannot be trusted and that he will trick Lechero as he tricked Bellick. At first Lechero is skeptical but then he decides to see for himself, and when Michael successfully outwits him and repairs the prison's electrical system, his trust in Michael is solidified. He later punishes Bellick for the bad information by scalding him with hot coffee. In [[Photo Finish (Prison Break episode)|Photo Finish]] Lechero slits Cheo for taking tribute from Augusto (It was actually Sammy). In [[Vamonos]] after Michael's failed escape, Lechero informs him that he will break out of prison, but with one catch\u2014he must take Lechero with him. In the following episode [[Bang & Burn]], Lechero reveals a tunnel which they can use to escape. in the episode [[Prison Break (season 3)#ep56|Hell or High Water]] Lechero is shot by the guards during the Sona Escape. In the following episode [[The Art of the Deal]] T-Bag and Bellick come to Lechero's aid. T-Bag tells Lechero that the guards will let them go for 50,000 dollars. Lechero calls his girlfriend who brings T-Bag the money. After getting the money T-Bag takes his place as the leader of Sona by suffocating Lechero with a pillow while Bellick stands by and watches in terror.\n\n=== Sof\u00eda Lugo ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = Sof\u00eda Lugo\n| portrayer          = [[Danay Garc\u00eda]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = \"[[Killing Your Number]]\" (2009)\n| alias              = \n| significant_other  = James Whistler <br> [[Lincoln Burrows]]\n| family             = \n| origin             = [[Panama]]\n}}\nSof\u00eda Lugo (played by  [[Danay Garc\u00eda]]) is the girlfriend of James Whistler. Having worked with Lincoln to help Michael break out Whistler in Season 3, she is with LJ in Season 4, though their whereabouts are unknown. The character is introduced to the series as a regular in the premiere episode of the third season of the series. Sof\u00eda Lugo is first seen posing as the wife of a dead inmate and a gravedigger, in order to get [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]]'s message written to her, transferred via the dead bodies. Sof\u00eda finds the note, which refers to a bank lock-box in a bank where a bird guide is contained. The book is then stolen by Lincoln Burrows and tells her to tell Whistler that he has it now. She meets Whistler in Sona, who keeps her in the dark about Scofield as he feared that Sof\u00eda might be killed if she knew too much. On her way out, she sees the visitation log, figures the connection and notes Lincoln's hotel and room number. She tails Lincoln to Saint Rita and confronts him. Lincoln tells her about the escape plan.\n\nIn \"[[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]]\", Sof\u00eda meets Whistler who demands to know the truth. He relents, telling her of The Company's interest in him and telling her to gather information on the brothers. Afterwards she meets Lincoln at his hotel wanting to help in the escape. Lincoln enlists her as an impromptu translator for Lincoln and the grave digger. Sof\u00eda helps to bargain with the price of the car of the grave digger, who is killed shortly after by Gretchen. She also accompanies Lincoln to bury the scuba gear and provides assistance, such as helping to drug one of the guards and hatching the escape plan for Scofield and James Whistler. She seemed to not completely trust Lincoln but in \"[[Bang & Burn]]\", she discovers Whistler's other identity and house, which casts doubt into her mind. A romantic connection begins to appear between Lincoln and Sof\u00eda due to her problems of mistrust with her boyfriend James Whistler. Later, in an attempt to force Whistler to give the coordinates, Sof\u00eda is captured and tortured by Gretchen Morgan.\n\nIn the season finale, after the exchange, Sof\u00eda decided to break up with Whistler, when she realized that she could no longer trust him. Sof\u00eda was shot by one of The Company members in \"[[The Art of the Deal]]\", but has not yet given in to the extent of her injuries. As she recovers in the hospital, she tells Michael to retrieve a box from her apartment which she had found, containing files on a man named Jason Lief. As Michael leaves to find Whistler, Lincoln and LJ decided to stay back to take care of Sof\u00eda.\n\nSof\u00eda appears briefly in the premiere episode of season 4, shopping with Lincoln and LJ, but when Lincoln kills a Company agent and is arrested, Sof\u00eda and L.J. run for it.\n\nShe reappears in the finale of season 4. She is held captive by Company agents but is released unharmed by the General after Sucre and C-Note apprehend him. Four years later, she is shown to be romantically involved with Lincoln.\n\nSofia does not appear in season 5, but in \"Progeny\" Lincoln mentions that he and Sofia have broken up.\n\n=== Gretchen Morgan ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = Gretchen Morgan\n| portrayer          = [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = ''[[Prison Break: The Final Break|The Final Break]]'' (2009)\n| alias              = Susan B.

Anthony, is introduced to the series in the third season as a high-ranking Company field-operative in charge of Whistler's breakout from Sona. Despite claiming to have killed Sara, season 4 revealed she lied and Sara is in fact alive. Gretchen finds herself in The Company's cross hairs after the Whistler/Scylla disaster and later is forced out of necessity to aid Self's \"A-Team\" against her former employers. She is ruthless and impatient, performing swift executions without hesitation if there is any obstacle to her plan, but is known to have a soft side for the few individuals that she cares about, for example her daughter. She is shown to be able to withstand torture and is exceptionally skilled in martial arts. Her character is mainly an antagonist, and later an occasional, uneasy ally to the protagonists. Gretchen is the main antagonist of the third season. The character is first seen covering scratch wounds on her face with makeup. Later, she meets up with Lincoln at a bar and informs him that The Company has kidnapped both [[Sara Tancredi|Sara]] and [[L.J. Burrows|LJ]], and that in order for them to survive, Michael must break James Whistler out of Sona prison. When Lincoln tries to rescue both of them, she claimed to have personally beheaded Sara and warned the brothers not to play games.<ref name=good>Good Fences</ref> Gretchen provides assistance to both of the brothers so that their plan would work, such as money for the gravedigger (whom she eventually executed as she suspected that he might report them to the police)<ref name=good/> and a drug that could help silence a guard.<ref name=photo/> When she finds out that Lincoln is trying to drug the guard much earlier than the hostage exchange time, she becomes furious and moves to behead the fearful [[L.J.

When the escape ultimately fails, Gretchen's supervisor, General Krantz, forced her to carry out the \"Bang and Burn\" Operation, which involved flying helicopters into Sona to retrieve Whistler. Due to Michael's intervention, this operation fails. Hoping that Lincoln could once again be included into the plan, Gretchen allowed Lincoln to meet his son at an abandoned shack. Michael's confession caused her to be subsequently tortured by [[waterboarding]] by Sona guards. However, Gretchen was able to escape from their clutches.<ref>Boxed In</ref> [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]] later revealed that her real name is Gretchen Morgan.<ref name=vamonos>Vamonos</ref> Following Michael and Whistler's escape from Sona, Gretchen was able to extract Whistler safely, but she failed to eliminate the brothers. In her final appearance of the season, she is seen driving away in a car with Whistler and Mahone (who had seemingly made a deal with Whistler to work for The Company after the escape).\n\nIn the season 4 premiere, Gretchen appears with Whistler on a mission to retrieve one of the Scylla cards, which fails when Whistler betrays The Company by stealing the original card, and Gretchen is punished by the general for her failure. Initially assumed dead, she is revealed to be alive at the end of \"Breaking and Entering\", locked away and tortured for information. She has only a minimal role in the next few episodes, but finally escapes custody in the fifth episode. \"Blow Out\" fleshes out her character when Gretchen takes shelter at her sister's house. It is revealed that Rita's child Emily is actually Gretchen's daughter, and the character shows her first hints of a softer side when they appear in scenes together. Following this, Gretchen recovers and enters the main plot to obtain Scylla. She tracks down T-Bag, who is in possession of Whistler's bird book, and forces him to co-operate. She eventually becomes a reluctant ally to Michael and his team, which includes Sara. In an effort to make amends with Sara, whom Gretchen tortured in Panama, she meets with her in \"The Price\" and offers her to get even by whipping Gretchen with a bull whip. Sara declines, instead stating that Gretchen will one day pay for the guard she murdered that helped Sara escape. In \"Greatness Achieved\", Gretchen is revealed to be a former lover of the General (who is also the father of her daughter, Emily) when she infiltrates his office with a gun seeking revenge. While she appears to soften at his manipulations, it is later revealed that she is merely playing along to gain inside information.\n\nGretchen and T-Bag serve mainly as wild cards in these episodes, playing Michael's team, with their real plan revealed to be using them to get Scylla, only to then steal it and sell it to a Chinese crime syndicate for 125 million. In their scenes together, Gretchen is often the more ruthless character, while T-Bag appears more hesitant as he grows attached to salesman Cole Pfeiffer, the alias he is living under to facilitate the break-in. In order to speed things along, Gretchen accepts the task of trying to steal the general's Scylla card by seducing him in \"Quite Riot\". He uncovers her true motivation, however, and she barely survives by pleading with him, confirming to the viewers that he is the father of her child. On the day of the break-in to steal Scylla, Gretchen and T-Bag stake out the Gate corporation with machine guns, preparing to ambush the team when they return. Gretchen and a reluctant T-Bag take the entire company hostage when someone spots her gun, and they are forced to flee when a federal agent arrives. In the next few episodes, Gretchen shares a plotline with Don Self, a Homeland Security agent that Michael's team reports to. After betraying the team and taking Scylla, Self threatens the life of Gretchen's daughter for her to help him find a new buyer. Gretchen complies and in \"Going Under\" they meet with the buyer, but fails when men appear to take them into Company custody. Following this, she is forced by the general to work with Self, Lincoln and T-Bag to recover Scylla. Her character is later written out when she is shot by the buyer and the rest of the team leave her behind to be arrested by the police.\n\nIn ''[[Prison Break: The Final Break|The Final Break]]'', Gretchen is shown to be an inmate in the prison that Sara is taken to, for the murder of Christina Scofield Hampton. When Gretchen sees Lincoln and Sucre standing outside the prison, she demands that Sara take her along in any escape plan they may be developing. While initially threatening, Gretchen eventually reveals to Sara that she simply desires to see her daughter, Emily, and to give her a necklace which she made herself. She proves her loyalty by saving Sara from an attacker looking to collect a bounty put out by the General, who is incarcerated in a neighboring prison. When the escape commences, Gretchen attacks a guard and gets stabbed in the leg. Knowing that she cannot escape without help, Gretchen asks Sara to choose to either leave her behind or help her, and Sara lends her hand. Finally, as Sara and Gretchen are on their way, Gretchen is spotted by guards. When asked whether or not she is alone, Gretchen refuses to reveal Sara's presence, and gets taken back into custody. This is the last time she is seen. Before leaving however, Sara sees the necklace Gretchen made for her daughter on the ground, and, knowing she would have been caught had Gretchen betrayed her, Sara secures it, so that she may pass it along to Emily.\n\n=== Donald Self ===\nDonald \"Don\" Self (played by  [[Michael Rapaport]]) is an [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement#Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)|ICE Homeland Security Investigations]] ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]]) special agent introduced in the [[Scylla (Prison Break episode)|fourth-season premiere]]. After their arrest, he recruits the protagonists and several other characters into a covert \"A-Team\" of sorts in a mission to take down The Company once and for all. The character plays a prominent role in the last season. Not much is known about him but he is stated as a hardworking Homeland Security Agent who tries to bring down The Company but has yet to be successful. He has worked for five years to bring down The Company with [[List of Prison Break characters#James Whistler|James Whistler]] and [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Other conspiracy characters|Aldo Burrows]] (Michael and Lincoln's father), the latter has also tried to locate Scylla. According to a background check made on the character by The Company in the episode \"Five the Hard Way\", Self studied law on Long Island, before spending the next 18 years moving around DOD and DOJ. He began working for Homeland Security in 2002. Agent Self later told Mahone that he had a wife that died while giving birth - his unborn infant died too. A picture of his wife is seen at his desk several times and he once played a message of her voice at his answering machine.<ref name=\"Scylla\">[[Scylla (Prison Break)|Scylla]]</ref><ref>[[Greatness Achieved (Prison Break)|Greatness Achieved]]</ref> The truth about his wife's fate is revealed near the end of the season. Self's character plays the role of supervisor and ally to the team in the first half of the season, but later becomes an antagonist. In \"Scylla\", he tasks Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield with the mission of bringing down The Company and finding \"Scylla\", a key card that stores a wealth of information about The Company. He promises them full exoneration if the brothers can obtain Scylla and hand it over to the government. As [[Fernando Sucre|Sucre]], [[Alexander Mahone|Mahone]], [[Brad Bellick|Bellick]], [[Sara Tancredi|Sara]], and Roland Glenn, a computer hijacker, come along with them, Self points out that if they do it there is no coming back and that he is their boss.<ref name=\"Scylla\"/><ref>[[Breaking & Entering (Prison Break)|Breaking & Entering]]</ref> The partnership with Self is not without friction, however. Most notably in \"Shut Down\" were Self, under pressure from his boss, reluctantly tries to cancel the mission after it is discovered that Scylla is six key cards, not just one. Self agrees to let them find the rest of the Scylla cards after the team successfully identifies the other cardholders.<ref>[[Shut Down (Prison Break)|Shut Down]]</ref> In other episodes throughout the season, however, the character provides active assistance to the team, like in \"Safe and Sound\" where Self, although overtly pessimistic about their chances, agree to help by first contriving an excuse to enter a cardholder's office and later in the episode by luring someone out of his office for lunch, leaving the team to get to a safe which contains a Scylla card.<ref>[[Safe & Sound (Prison Break)|Safe & Sound]]</ref> He also has his computer analysts identify the rest of the cardholders from the picture taken with Michael's cell phone.\n\nWhen General Krantz, the leader of The Company, discovers Self had images of him enhanced, Wyatt confronts Self and tells him that the General \"likes his privacy.\"<ref>[[Blow Out (Prison Break)|Blow Out]]</ref> Taking Mahone's advice; to get aggressive, Self meets the General face-to-face and blackmails him, threatening to reveal to the public missions he was involved in, thus making it harder for The Company to remain covert.<ref>[[Five the Hard Way (Prison Break)|Five the Hard Way]]</ref> As the season unfolds, Self's character begins to show tendencies of a more ruthless side. He often threatens to kill those who oppose him, and in \"Blow Out\", after Mahone becomes a liability to the mission by getting arrested by the police, Self wants to have Mahone killed, something Michael refuses to do. Instead the team rescue Mahone, without Self's assistance. In \"The Legend\" the team grows a dislike for Self when he seems unwilling to hold up his end of the deal and send Bellick's body home after he died in the previous episode. However, in \"Quiet Riot\", he is actively supportive of the mission and seems to genuinely want to bring down The Company. Self's character shows his true colours in the episode \"Selfless,\" where he apparently works with the team as they finally manage to recover the Scylla, but ultimately betrays both them and his government superiors by stealing the recovered Scylla and keeping it for himself. His real character motivation is revealed to be finding a 'buyer' for Scylla, an apparently private interest. Realizing that the needs to find a new buyer after the first one is killed, Self murders his partner, federal agent Miriam Holtz, in cold blood in order to get to T-Bag, a prisoner she was guarding. From this point onwards, the character begins to share a more active role in the plot by being out in the field and appearing in more action-oriented scenes. In the next few episodes, he is an antagonist to Michael and the rest of the team. After faking his death and attempting to frame Michael's team for it in \"Deal or No Deal\", Self uses T-Bag to track down the family of Gretchen Morgan, a former Company operative that has gone rogue. Self threatens the life of her daughter to gain her co-operation and the two characters share the same plotline for the next few episodes, as they use Gretchen's contacts to find another buyer for Scylla. However, at the end of the episode, Self finds himself with a problem: the mistrust of Michael Scofield, who removed a part of the Scylla device. While his apprehension of T-Bag led to Gretchen and a buyer, he cannot sell Scylla while it is incomplete. Thus, the episode ends with him ultimately demanding the missing part of Scylla from Michael, who instead suggests he \"Come and get it\".\n\nIn the next episode, \"Just Business\" Self seemingly makes a deal with Michael to sell Scylla together, while both parties are actually plotting against each other. Self and Gretchen plants an x-ray device in the warehouse to try to find the missing piece of scylla while the team are planning to take the rest of Scylla back from Self. In the end it is Self who is successful, as he and Gretchen obtains the missing piece and head out to meet Gretchen's contact, a conduit named Vikan. Self's character is again shown to be ruthless when, after asking Vikan if the buyer of Scylla is coming, Self shoots Vikan and his bodyguards and tosses their corpse into the sea so that he doesn\u2019t have to share a cut of the money with them. Self is next seen waiting with Gretchen for the Scylla buyer. After getting a call from Gretchen's sister, Rita, Gretchen tells Self that The Company has T-Bag and unfortunately he might have told The Company where they are. So before Lincoln and Sucre could track them, Self and Gretchen destroy their cell phones and flee. They're next seen at a phone store and look injured with bloody scratches on their faces. They buy a new phone and tell the store owner not to tell anyone they were there. They head to the warehouse to wait for the buyer. The buyer arrives and Self and Gretchen hold the buyer at gunpoint. Gretchen forces Self to hand Scylla to the buyer or they will be in grave danger. Self hands over Scylla. They hear noise and Self and Gretchen go to investigate, but are betrayed by the buyer when he points his gun at them and they run for cover and a shootout occurs. The buyer shoots Self in the shoulder and flees with the money and Scylla. Later they are to work with Lincoln and T-Bag to recover Scylla. Self's character plays a less prominent role in the season's final episodes, where he works with his new team to find Scylla and track down the new buyer, which turns out to be Lincoln and Michael's mother, Christina Rose Scofield. When the team fails in their assignment, the general decides to punish them by ordering the death of one of their family members and singles out Self's wife, who is actually alive and in a [[persistent vegetative state]] due to Self's drunk and reckless behavior. Self then escapes, but gets arrested when at the hospital, where one of Christina's men injects him with a serum that gradually leaves him in the same state his wife was in. He refuses to help federal agents with locating Burrows and Scofield because they failed at protecting him, and is left in his vegetative state for the rest of his life. In his final appearance in the epilogue of the Series Finale, set four years after the events of the rest of the episode, Self is revealed to be living at a rest facility, using a wheelchair, mute and drooling.\n\n=== Jacob Anton Ness/Poseidon ===\nJacob Anton Ness (played by [[Mark Feuerstein]]) is an economics professor at University of Syracuse, and Sara's second husband and Mike's stepfather. He and Sara were married sometime during the seven years after Michael's supposed death. In the season premiere, he is shot in the leg by someone supposedly sent to kill Sara and Mike due to Lincoln investigating Michael's death, and spends the next two episodes recovering in the hospital. During this time, Sara finds out Michael is still alive under the name Kaniel Outis, and tells him. He tells her that Michael may have succumbed to madness due to the choices he made. After being released, he, Sara and Mike lie low at his parents' lake house per Sara's choice, though he says the university has resources that can be used to find their attackers. T-Bag eventually tracks the attackers to a meeting with him. Sara confronts him on this, and he claims he was paying them off to leave him alone, and later seems to prove this by having them arrested with a tracker in the money, forgiving Sara for her paranoia. However, Michael later reveals him to be \"Poseidon\", a rogue CIA agent that he has been working for in exchange for exoneration of himself and others. Michael also reveals that he murdered the CIA agent Michael's alias is accused of having murdered. Sara returns to New York and tries to pretend she does not know, but he sees through this immediately, and captures her and Mike. Michael, Lincoln and their contacts try to catch him, and manage to track him to his lake house, but he seemingly turns the tables and has one of his subordinates ambush Michael and Mike, with Sara's fate unknown. He is ultimately caught and incarcerated at Fox River, where he is attacked by T-Bag as retribution for Whip's death.\n\n=== Sheba ===\nSheba (played by [[Inbar Lavi]]) is a woman who leads a resistance movement in Yemen, and C-Note's contact when he and Lincoln arrive. She allows the two to visit Ogygia, and later helps them rescue a man who can help them facilitate Michael's escape, as well as his daughter and several schoolgirls, from [[ISIL]]. She and Lincoln later attempt to get fake passports, but are captured, and she is nearly raped by a one-eyed man who had a crush on her in high school, but is saved by Lincoln. She and C-Note bring the people they saved from ISIL to an airport and manage to get on board a small plane, but are forced to leave without Michael, Lincoln and their fellow escapees. They make it to Jordan, and eventually back to the States, where she and C-Note regroup with Michael and Lincoln, and help them track down Poseidon and his subordinates to find Sara and Mike. Eventually, when Michael figures out where they are, Lincoln kisses her and sends her back to take care of the others, claiming he could not forgive himself if something happened to her.\n\n=== David \"Whip' Martin ===\nDavid \"Whip\" Martin (played by [[Augustus Prew]]) is first introduced as Michael's cellmate in Ogygia in season 5. He is quickly revealed to know that Michael is not Kaniel Outis, and that he and Michael have been breaking people out of prisons around the world for years. Michael repeatedly calls him his (Michael's) whip-hand, hence his nickname. He is loyal to Michael despite not knowing his real name, but as their time in Ogygia goes on and their escape plan doesn't seem to be working, he starts to become more paranoid that Michael will betray him, which only increases when Abu Ramal, the prisoner they are in Ogygia to break out, is released from solitary confinement. Michael repeatedly tells him he will not leave him, but he continues to be frightened, even fighting Michael and forcing a guard to break them up (though this is part of Michael's plan). He confronts Michael during the escape, where Michael finally reveals his plan to leave Ramal behind, satisfying Whip. However, the escape fails, and he, Michael, Ramal and their cellmate Ja are thrown into solitary confinement, where he starts to become paranoid once again as [[ISIL]] strikes land closer to the prison. After Michael convinces Ramal to help them escape, he and Ja are released from their cells when Michael gets the keys. They try to persuade Michael to leave Ramal behind, but Michael admits he is necessary. Eventually the four escape the prison along with Sid, another inmate, and formulate a plan to double-cross Ramal, but he turns the tables on them. Whip tells Ramal he was arrested for killing a man in a barfight, and when they are surprised by Lincoln, he takes the opportunity to kill Ramal, which ends up backfiring. With ISIL hunting them, he continues to follow Michael, now knowing his real name, despite two of their plans for escape failing. Eventually the group tries to escape across the desert to Phaecia, a small fishing village, and Whip kills several ISIL members following them. He accompanies Michael and Lincoln to [[Crete, Greece]], and expresses his admiration for an injured Michael. He then accompanies them on to a freighter, arranged by Sucre, back to the States. When they are caught by NAVY Seals, he escapes with Michael, Lincoln and Sucre in a life raft, and is taken by fishing boat to France, from where Michael instead sends him to Chicago instead of New York. During this time, it is revealed that his real name is David Martin, and that he was a survivor in prison, which is why Michael chose him as his partner (and the cover story he told Ramal may have been why he was originally incarcerated). In Chicago, he follows coordinates given by Michael to Lake Michigan, where he meets T-Bag. T-Bag reveals that he is in fact his father, which is the reason why he Michael made him his whip-hand.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Prison Break minor characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/bios/ Official characters' biographies] at Fox's ''Prison Break'' website\n\n{{Prison Break}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prison Break Characters, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of Prison Break characters|Characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|List of characters on American television series Prison Break}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Prison Break'' characters}}\n[[Image:Prison Break Cast.jpg|thumb|350px|Cast members of ''Prison Break'': [[Amaury Nolasco]], [[Robert Knepper]], [[Wade Williams]], [[Sarah Wayne Callies]], [[Wentworth Miller]] with executive producer [[Matt Olmstead]]]]\n\nThis is a '''list of characters''' in the [[United States|American]] television series, ''[[Prison Break]]''.\n\n== Main characters ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 300\n| footer    = [[Dominic Purcell]] ([[Lincoln Burrows]]), [[Wentworth Miller]] ([[Michael Scofield]]), and [[Robin Tunney]] (Veronica Donovan)\n| image1    = Dominic Purcell Edwards AFB.jpg\n| image2    = Wentworth by Andrew Horovitz.JPG\n| image3    = RobinTunneyHWOFFeb2013.jpg \n}} \n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 300\n| footer    = [[Peter Stormare]] ([[John Abruzzi]]), [[Amaury Nolasco]] ([[Fernando Sucre]]), and [[Marshall Allman]] (Lincoln \"L.

He is surprised to see his younger brother Michael Scofield in the same prison and who\nis planning to break him out of prison before his execution. He evaded authorities after escaping from prison and has been exonerated of all charges.  In the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Lincoln, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. When they fail to retrieve L. J. Burrows before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. In season 3 he currently free and successfully assisted Michael and [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]] to break out of Sona. As of season 4, he is now part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company.\nHe is also in the very last scene when he visits Michael Scofield's (his brother) grave, and he puts an origami crane on top of the grave so he can remember the time when he made them for him, so he would always know that his brother was caring for him. \nIn season 5, he finds out Michael is still alive and incarcerated in Yemen, and leads an operation to save his brother.\n\nPurcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast.<ref name=\"TVGuide-2006aug08\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Prison-Break-DVD-38536.aspx |title=Prison Break DVD News, Season 2 Preview! |accessdate=17 January 2009 |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |date=8 August 2006 |work=TV Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313111139/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Prison-Break-DVD-38536.aspx |archivedate=13 March 2009 }}</ref> He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on ''[[North Shore (TV series)|North Shore]]''.\n\n=== Michael Scofield ===\n{{see also|Michael Scofield}} \n'''Michael Scofield''' (played by  [[Wentworth Miller]]) is the protagonist of the series and younger brother of [[Lincoln Burrows]]. He designs an elaborate escape plan and tattoos it to his body to free his older brother who has been framed for murder and sentenced to death via the electric chair. He successfully executes this plan, freeing himself, Lincoln and 6 other convicts, but ultimately fails to evade the police in Panama. In the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Michael, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. When they fail to retrieve L. J. Burrows before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. Michael and Lincoln travel together, after the fugitives separate to accomplish each of their individual goals. Season 3 is centered around Michael breaking out of prison again, however, this time from the self-governed prison of Sona, situated in Panama. In season 4, he reunites with Sara after discovering her death in season 3 was faked, and she is part of Agent Donald Self's covert \"A-Team\", which is assembled to bring down [[The Company (Prison Break)|The Company]]. Michael has low latent inhibition, a personality trait which allows him to notice things that others would not. This, along with his genius-level intellect, is what enabled him to break out of both prisons. He also suffers from a tumor of the hypothalamus, which causes nosebleeds, disorientation, and extreme pain. In season 5, he is revealed to be incarcerated in Yemen under a different name; Kaniel Outis. It is gradually revealed that Michael, along with a fellow prisoner named Whip, are undercover CIA operatives, but were betrayed by a mastermind agent known as Poseidon.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Veronica Donovan ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image                =\n| caption              = \n| name                 = Veronica Donovan\n| first  = \"[[Pilot (Prison Break)|Pilot]]\" (2005)\n| last = \"[[Manhunt (Prison Break)|Manhunt]]\" (2006)\n| creator = [[Paul Scheuring]]\n| portrayer            = [[Robin Tunney]]<br />Annie Yokom (young)\n| occupation           = Lawyer\n| family               = \n| significant_others    = Sebastian Balfour <br />[[Lincoln Burrows]]\n}}\n'''Veronica Donovan''' (played by  [[Robin Tunney]]) is a real-estate lawyer and a longtime friend of the protagonists of the series, who unsuccessfully tries to find evidence to exonerate Lincoln Burrows. She serves as the primary ally of the brothers in the show's first season. Veronica had a relationship with Lincoln in High School and the two also dated each other after she graduated from Baylor law school. However, at the start of the show they have broken up since several years. When Lincoln is first framed for the murder of Terrence Steadman, Veronica assumes that he is guilty and moves on with her life. Sometime between the episode \"[[Brother's Keeper (Prison Break episode)|Brother's Keeper]]\",  and the pilot, she gets engaged to Sebastian Balfour. Although she is a real estate lawyer and not a criminal lawyer, Veronica defends her childhood friend, Michael Scofield at his trial. Initially, she doesn't believe Lincoln's innocence and is convinced by the security tape footage. However, after the disappearance of Leticia Barris, a witness who could prove Lincoln's innocence and the death of a bishop who opposed Lincoln's death penalty, Veronica is led to believe that Lincoln might have been set up. Thus, Michael's arrest causes her to grow more involved with Lincoln's case, straining her relationship with Sebastian. Following the disappearance of Leticia in the episode \"Cell Test\", Veronica decides to postpone the wedding as she claims that she can\u2019t focus on it at the time. Sebastian is hurt by this and breaks off the engagement.\n\nShe approaches ''Project Justice'' for help with Lincoln's case, knowing that she herself doesn't have any experience in death penalty cases. However, they refuse to partake in her case. [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Nick Savrinn|Nick Savrinn]] later offers his help after telling her that his father was similarly accused of a crime he did not commit. Together, they work tirelessly, trying to uncover the truth behind Terrence Steadman's apparent murder. The original security tape which they were looking for is destroyed and in the subsequent episode, \"[[Riots, Drills and the Devil#Part 2|Riots, Drills and the Devil Part 2]]\", they are threatened via a public phone call in Washington, D.C. and are targeted by [[Paul Kellerman]] and [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Other conspiracy characters|Daniel Hale]], who are members of the conspiracy. They were nearly killed by an explosion in Veronica's apartment and in the following episodes, [[list of Prison Break characters#Lincoln \"L.J.\" Burrows|LJ Burrows]] joins both of them after escaping from the agent's clutches. All three of them go into hiding. Their lives are once again in danger when an assassin called Agent Quinn manages to find out their secret location. Veronica eventually manages to knock him unconscious and escape with LJ and a wounded Nick. Veronica is then contacted by a secret informant, who claims to be willing to provide information. Knowing that hiding is not the answer, Veronica decides to go out into the open and reveal the conspiracy to the public. Veronica meets with the informant, agent Hale, the following night, where he reveals that Steadman is still alive. Hale is executed by Kellerman before he can provide proof, and Veronica barely has time to hide shortly before Kellerman arrives.\n\nNow left more or less empty handed, Veronica and Nick nevertheless goes back to the court on Lincoln's execution day for one last time to appeal for Lincoln's case, but this ultimately fails as the judge rules against them. Fortunately, someone slips in evidence in the last minute which helps to stall Lincoln's execution. Veronica and Nick decide to send someone to do a test on Steadman's body, but the dental records matched Steadman's past records. Following this, she decides to find out where the real Steadman is hiding. In \"J-Cat\", Nick, Veronica and L.J. return to [[New Glarus, Wisconsin|New Glarus]] to visit the dead Quinn, where they obtain his cell phone. Eventually, they found out Terrence Steadman's hideout in Blackfoot, Montana. However, at the end of the episode \"Tonight\", Veronica is betrayed by Nick, who turned out to have made a deal with John Abruzzi to have her \"ready and waiting\" at the airport on the night of the escape in exchange for his father's freedom. Nick is conflicted, however, and ultimately lets her go to the airport as he doesn't want Veronica to be killed. Now alone, she travels to Blackfoot, Montana and manages to sneak into Steadman's house and confront him face to face.\n\nIn season 2, following her confrontation with Steadman ([[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]]), Veronica is executed in cold blood by secret service agents ordered to ensure that Terrence Steadman is kept hidden. Veronica becomes the first main character to be killed off in the series.\n\n=== John Abruzzi ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series               = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour               = #cccfff\n| name                 = John Abruzzi\n| first  = \"[[Pilot (Prison Break)|Pilot]]\" (2005)\n| last = \"[[First Down (Prison Break)|First Down]]\" (2006)\n| portrayer            = [[Peter Stormare]]\n| creator = [[Paul Scheuring]]\n| occupation           = Don of the Abruzzi Family of the Chicago Mafia\n| family               = {{Plainlist|\n* Nicole Abruzzi (daughter)\n* John Abruzzi, Jr (son)\n* Luca Abruzzi (son)\n}}\n| spouse       = Sylvia Abruzzi\n}}\n'''John Abruzzi''' (played by  [[Peter Stormare]]) is an [[Italian-American]] mob boss and the Don of the Abruzzi crime family, who is imprisoned at Fox River with a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]]. He controls Prison Industry, an internal work program for the convicts, thanks to his connections with [[Brad Bellick]], who is on the payroll of Abruzzi's associates. He appears as an anti-hero where he is less of an antagonist than an unwanted ally to the protagonists. He is convicted based on the testimony of Otto Fibonacci, who saw him order the deaths of two men. Abruzzi plans to exact revenge on Fibonacci, who entered the witness protection program. In the pilot episode, he is approached by Michael Scofield with a PI membership request. Abruzzi at first dismisses the newcomer, but gives him his full attention after he learns that Michael somehow knows where Fibonacci is hiding. Although Michael claims that he will give up the information in exchange for help with his escape plan, Abruzzi has two of Michael's toes cut off trying to extract Fibonacci's location from him. This fails and Abruzzi decides to instead team up with Michael to break out of prison. Although their alliance is initially unstable, with both men being wary of each other, Abruzzi and Michael learn to get along as the season progresses. Abruzzi's status as head of PI proves valuable to Michael's escape plan, as the escape team is able to use work on PI to build an escape tunnel.\n\nFor some time, the escape plan is threatened when Abruzzi's associate on the outside, Philly Falzone, cuts off Abruzzi's cash stream and takes his prison privileges from him as payback for failing to find Fibonacci. Together, Michael and Abruzzi decides to frame Falzone in the episode \"Sleight of Hand\", allowing Abruzzi to restore his control of PI. When fellow escapee T-Bag becomes an obstacle, Abruzzi has one of his men on the outside kidnap T-Bag's cousin. The job goes bad, resulting in the death of the cousin as well as his young son. Abruzzi is deeply shaken over the death of the toddler and turns to religion as an outlet for his pain, causing him to spare T-Bag's life even though he had intended to kill him. This proves to be a big mistake, as T-Bag immediately takes the opportunity to slash Abruzzi's throat. He is evacuated by helicopter to receive treatment for his injuries. Abruzzi survives and returns six episodes later in \"The Key\". Upon his return he appears to have become very religious and friendly; it is soon discovered to be a ploy, as Abruzzi ruthlessly plans to kill most of the team and arranges to kidnap [[Veronica Donovan]] to force Fibonacci's location out of Michael, although this fails since Nick Savrinn released Veronica. After the escape, Abruzzi attempts to gun down T-Bag, but he handcuffs himself to Michael to avoid getting shot at. Abruzzi exacts revenge on T-Bag, cutting off his left hand with an axe, the one he attached himself to Michael with. He is one of the group of five who are forced to run on foot after his plane leaves them behind.\n\nAbruzzi appears only briefly in season 2. After being on the run with the other four escapees, he separates from the group and reunites with his family in New York. No longer interested in finding out Fibonacci's location, he plans to flee with his family to Sardinia. He had a sudden change of mind when, one of his thugs informs him about Fibonacci's exact location, but is instead lured into a trap set up by Mahone and the [[FBI]], using Fibonacci as bait. Rather choosing death over returning to prison, Abruzzi raises his weapon and is gunned down, with a cross in hand. He is the first member of the Fox River Eight to be taken down by the authorities.\n\nIn season 5, he is revealed to have an older son who did not appear in the original series, named Luca Abruzzi, who Lincoln began working for.\n;Production details\n\nPeter Stormare, Abruzzi's portrayer, was a member of the regular cast and was featured in every episode before his character's injury in the thirteenth episode of the first season, \"[[End of the Tunnel (Prison Break episode)|End of the Tunnel]]\". After his return to the series six episodes later in \"[[The Key (Prison Break episode)|The Key]]\", Stormare became a recurring guest star, appearing in the final four episodes of the first season and in the first, second and fourth episodes of the second season. The character was later killed off in the fourth episode of the second season, \"[[First Down (Prison Break episode)|First Down]]\". He later appeared in a brief flashback in the episode \"[[Fin Del Camino]].\"\n\n=== Fernando Sucre ===\n{{see also|Fernando Sucre}} \n'''Fernando Sucre''' (played by  [[Amaury Nolasco]]) is imprisoned at [[Fox River State Penitentiary]] for aggravated robbery and was ratted out by the man trying to steal his girlfriend.

Marshall Allman was listed as part of the main cast until the fourteenth episode of the second season, \"[[John Doe (Prison Break episode)|John Doe]]\". In the pilot episode, despite his normally good behavior, L.J. is arrested for drug possession and put on probation. Part of his punishment is to visit a mentor, his father, once weekly. The first encounter is cold, but their relationship grows warmer, However, L.J. is targeted by conspiracy agents [[Paul Kellerman]] and [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Other conspiracy characters|Daniel Hale]]; after they frame him for the murders of his [[Lisa Rix|mother]] and [[Adrian Rix|stepfather]], L.

In season 2, L.J. is visited in jail by [[Alexander Mahone]], who asks for his help to capture Lincoln and Michael; L.J. refuses to co-operate. His family nearly breaks him out of the courthouse, but the escape is foiled and L.J. is sent to an adult detention center. He is later set free in a move by The Company to find Lincoln. Though they are able to outsmart the agents and escape, they are arrested by the police in \"[[Unearthed (Prison Break episode)|Unearthed]]\". They are later saved by people working for Lincoln's father, and L. J. is sent with his grandfather's friend Jane for safety.\n\nIn [[Wash (Prison Break episode)|\"Wash\"]] L.J. is revealed to be living in [[Pullman, Washington]] under a false name. This ends in season 3, where L.J is kidnapped by The Company and held hostage as motivation for Lincoln and Michael to break Whistler out of Sona. After Whistler is broken out, the hostage exchange is successful at a museum, and L.J. is reunited with his father. L.J. appears briefly in the season 4 [[Scylla (Prison Break episode)|premiere]] and is briefly mentioned in the epilogue of the series finale when Lincoln says that L.J. is taking his finals in school, implying that wherever he is, he is doing well. L.J. does not appear in season 5, nor is he mentioned.\n\n=== Brad Bellick ===\n{{see also|Brad Bellick}}\nBrad Bellick (played by  [[Wade Williams]]) is the leader of the Fox River State Penitentiary correctional officers but is later dismissed. He goes after [[Charles Westmoreland]]'s hidden five million dollars, but fails. Set up for murder twice by T-Bag, he ended up incarcerated at Sona. He later escaped from Sona between Season's 3 and 4 along with Sucre and T-Bag. After his escape he was recruited to be part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company. He drowned while trying to put up a pipe to cross a main water conduit, saving the Scylla plan.\n\n=== Paul Kellerman ===\n{{see also|Paul Kellerman}}\nPaul Kellerman (played by  [[Paul Adelstein]]) is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent who was ordered to make sure Lincoln Burrows is framed and convicted for murder, along with various other illegal acts.

He is revealed to still be alive at end of season 4.\n\nIn season 5, he is still working for the government, and is also revealed to be married and divorced with joint custody of a daughter.\n\n=== Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell ===\n{{see also|Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell}}\nTheodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (played by  [[Robert Knepper]]) is imprisoned at Fox River State Penitentiary with a life sentence<ref>[http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/bios/bio_bagwell.htm Character biography of Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell] at Prison Break's official site.</ref> for six accounts of kidnapping, rape, and murder. He escapes with Michael's help and reconnects with his previous family by kidnapping them. He frees them after an emotional outbreak, however. He goes to Panama and ends up in Sona for killing a number of prostitutes. T-Bag took over Sona after killing its former ruler, Lechero. However, sometime between season 3 and 4, he has broken out of Sona along with Sucre and Bellick and is now on a mission to head back to the US to settle the score with Michael for double-crossing him on the escape from Sona at the end of season 3. He later is forced to be a reluctant member of Self's \"A-Team\".\nIn season 5, he is released from Fox River and given an operation which gives him a prosthetic hand as functional as a natural one. he is also given a photo which shows Michael is still alive in Yemen, and becomes an unwanted ally of Sara. Though Bagwell initially believed himself to be incapable of fathering a child due to being conceived as a result of inbreeding, Michael reveals to him that he has an illegitimate son in David \"Whip\" Martin. The chance for a fresh start and family serves as T-Bag's motivation for continuing to assist Michael. When Whip is killed, T-Bag snaps the neck of his killer; and as a result finds himself imprisoned in Fox River; where he exacts further vengeance upon Poseidon, who is assigned his cellmate.\n\n=== Sara Tancredi ===\n{{see also|Sara Tancredi}}\nSara Tancredi (played by  [[Sarah Wayne Callies]]) is Michael's love interest, daughter of the Illinois governor, and a doctor working at Fox River State Penitentiary before becoming involved in the conspiracy behind Lincoln Burrows' setup. She eventually shoots a corrupt government agent, [[William Kim]], and Michael takes the fall for it, giving her freedom. Apparently brutally decapitated, her head was placed in the box at the beginning of season 3, though it was later discovered to be a ploy and she is in fact alive.

He is responsible for the deaths of three of the Fox River Eight. In turn, Michael sets him up for possession of cocaine, which leads to his incarceration at Sona, as well. He escaped from Sona with Michael and Whistler at the end of season 3, and is now part of Self's covert \"A-Team\" assembled to bring down The Company in season 4.

This resulted in a bounty being placed on his head, as the mayor offered to free (via a corrupt judge) any inmate who would kill Whistler, forcing Whistler to go into hiding in the sewers after he arrived at the prison.<ref>Dialogue spoken by [[Carlo Alban]] as McGrady, \"[[Fire/Water]]\", Prison Break season 3 episode 3.</ref> His only contact with the outside world was his girlfriend [[Sofia Lugo|Sof\u00eda]], who obliviously believes in his innocence. Breaking him out of Sona became Michael Scofield's primary mission during season three, though Whistler and his mysterious background causes tension between both men as various aspects of Whistler's background (most notably the story that he is needed to be freed in order to deliver vaguely explained \"coordinates\" recorded within a bird watcher guidebook Whistler carries with him at all times) cause Michael to question whether or not he is helping an innocent man caught in the vast web of conspiracies of The Company, as Whistler claims to be.\n\nHe is first seen in [[Orientaci\u00f3n]] hiding within a crawlspace below the room of [[Lechero]], the de facto leader of the prison. When he first saw [[Brad Bellick]], he offered him food in return for a favor. When a fight broke out between two inmates (one of whom was Michael Scofield) Bellick was to place a note on each of the two inmates in order to get more food from Whistler. He was apparently attempting to send a message to [[Sofia Lugo]]. Sof\u00eda found the note, which read \"VERSAILLES 1989 V MADRID\", and lead her to a bank lock-box containing what appeared to be a bird guide. The book was then stolen by Lincoln Burrows.\n\nThe Company seems to have an interest in Whistler, and this is apparently the reason Michael's incarceration in Sona was arranged in the first place. Due to the political spotlight on him, The Company were unable to get him out. Initially, Whistler is seemingly unaware of why The Company wants him. One of The Company's operatives, Elliott Pike, approached Michael and offered their support if he breaks Whistler out. When he refused, another operative, who called herself only by the obviously false name [[Susan B. Anthony (Prison Break character)|Susan B. Anthony]], approached Michael's brother Lincoln Burrows and informed them that Lincoln's son [[L.J. Burrows]] and Michael's girlfriend [[Sara Tancredi]] were being held hostage by The Company and would be killed if Michael didn't break Whistler out within a week.\n\nAfter the [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head and his location is discovered by both Michael and [[Alexander Mahone|Mahone]], Mahone delivers him to prison boss Lechero. Fortunately, Lechero chooses to remove the bounty on Whistler at Michael's request, giving up the reward of freedom from the mayor, after Michael restores water to the prison. Whistler tries to befriend Mahone in an effort to get information on Scofield. Later he reveals why The Company is interested in him. They want to know where Whistler took a certain naturalist to during one of his charters. But he needs the bird guide, which is actually his trip log to retrace his steps and take The Company to that location.\n\nIn [[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]] the bird guide is returned to him with the warning that he is running out of time. Meanwhile, he asks Sof\u00eda to look into Scofield and Burrows because he doesn't trust any of them. Also he tells Sof\u00eda The Company is interested in him because of a charter he did in [[Seattle]]. Michael instructs Whistler to spy on one of the tower guards to learn their behavior. Whistler observes a window of 6 minutes where the sun's glare forces the guard to look away. When it is revealed he covers for Michael by claiming to be a bird lover. Meanwhile, a new inmate, Tyge claims to know him, calling him by the name McFadden and seeing him in 1997 in [[Nice]] at the [[Ambassador]] [[hotel]], thus casting doubt on his story in Michael's eyes.\n\nTyge is murdered and Whistler is suspected after McGrady tips off Lechero that the two had an argument. His life is in danger until Michael manages to intervene. In [[Vamonos]] it is later revealed that Whistler has been deceitful with Michael, and has actually been working with Gretchen (Susan B. Anthony), and that it is he who is orchestrating his break from Sona. Susan aka Gretchen tells him the plan Bang and Burn is in effect, which both dismissed as suicide until [[Pad Man (character)|Pad Man]] says it is the only option after Michael failed to take James out of Sona. While James gets to the roof of Sona during a military [[helicopter]] rescue of him, Michael Scofield, knowing his position is dead without him, stops the prison break. Scofield was then taken away to confess what he knew about the helicopter squad.\n\nScofield's confession caused Whistler to be implicated. In the subsequent torture, Whistler revealed Gretchen Morgan, the woman who had been orchestrating the entire escape. After learning that Gretchen escaped from the Sona guards clutches, both Whistler and Scofield returned to Sona. Whistler, Michael, Mahone, and McGrady later escape from Sona, Lechero is shot and injured, while [[T-Bag]] and [[Bellick]] are caught during the escape. He realizes he lost his book during his escape. After getting out of Sona, Whistler manages to escape from Michael and Lincoln but is then caught again. The exchange for L.J. and him goes well, but it is realized there never were coordinates in the bird book. He tries to explain to Sof\u00eda, but at this point she wants nothing to do with him. He escapes with Gretchen and The Company. He is later seen making a deal with Mahone to join up with The Company and Mahone, Gretchen, and he drives away.\n\nWhistler appears briefly in the season 4 premiere. After he betrays The Company by planning to steal Scylla, he is shot and killed by Company hitman Wyatt. A later episode reveals that he had arranged to sell Scylla to the Chinese, rather than handing it over to the government.\n\n=== Norman \"Lechero\" St. John ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = Norman St. John \n| portrayer          =  [[Robert Wisdom]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = \"[[The Art of the Deal (Prison Break episode)|The Art of the Deal]]\" (2007)\n| alias              = Lechero\n| occupation  = Drug kingpin\n| family             = Unnamed deceased mother\n| significant_other =  Mary Francis\n| origin             = [[Panama]]\n}}\nNorman St. John (played by  [[Robert Wisdom]]) is a Panamanian drug kingpin incarcerated at Sona, where he is the leader of the prison and is at the top of the prison hierarchy. He appears only in season 3 where his role is similar of that of John Abruzzi in season 1. Ruthless and violent, he earned the nickname \"Lechero\" when he, at the age of 13, disguised himself as a lechero (milkman) in order to kill his mother's rapist. The character serves as an antagonist and enemy to the protagonists in the early episodes of season 3, but later becomes an uneasy ally. Lechero is introduced in the season 3 premiere episode [[Orientacion (Prison Break episode)|Orientacion]]. Aware of Michael Scofield's ventures as a fugitive from the United States, Lechero views him as a threat to his rule and plots to get rid of him by setting Michael up in a fight to the death with another prisoner. However, Michael survives. Lechero also meets [[Theodore Bagwell|T-Bag]] in this episode and accepts him as his underling. The relationship between him and Michael continues to be characterized by deceit and mistrust in the next few episodes, like in [[Call Waiting (Prison Break episode)|Call Waiting]], when Michael steals Lechero's cell phone. But Lechero learns in [[Fire/Water (Prison Break episode)|Fire/Water]], that Michael can be useful as well when he restores water to the prison. Lechero grows increasingly paranoid as the season progresses, and is later tricked by T-Bag that his cronies are planning a coup against him, successfully manipulating Lechero to enlist T-Bag as a spy.\n\nIn [[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]], Lechero gets in trouble when the electrical system in the prison stops functioning. Remembering that Michael is an engineer, he quickly enlists Michael's help to fix the system, in exchange for a new cell in the prison block. He is later approached by Bellick, who warns him that Michael cannot be trusted and that he will trick Lechero as he tricked Bellick. At first Lechero is skeptical but then he decides to see for himself, and when Michael successfully outwits him and repairs the prison's electrical system, his trust in Michael is solidified. He later punishes Bellick for the bad information by scalding him with hot coffee. In [[Photo Finish (Prison Break episode)|Photo Finish]] Lechero slits Cheo for taking tribute from Augusto (It was actually Sammy). In [[Vamonos]] after Michael's failed escape, Lechero informs him that he will break out of prison, but with one catch\u2014he must take Lechero with him. In the following episode [[Bang & Burn]], Lechero reveals a tunnel which they can use to escape. in the episode [[Prison Break (season 3)#ep56|Hell or High Water]] Lechero is shot by the guards during the Sona Escape. In the following episode [[The Art of the Deal]] T-Bag and Bellick come to Lechero's aid. T-Bag tells Lechero that the guards will let them go for 50,000 dollars. Lechero calls his girlfriend who brings T-Bag the money. After getting the money T-Bag takes his place as the leader of Sona by suffocating Lechero with a pillow while Bellick stands by and watches in terror.\n\n=== Sof\u00eda Lugo ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = Sof\u00eda Lugo\n| portrayer          = [[Danay Garc\u00eda]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = \"[[Killing Your Number]]\" (2009)\n| alias              = \n| significant_other  = James Whistler <br> [[Lincoln Burrows]]\n| family             = \n| origin             = [[Panama]]\n}}\nSof\u00eda Lugo (played by  [[Danay Garc\u00eda]]) is the girlfriend of James Whistler. Having worked with Lincoln to help Michael break out Whistler in Season 3, she is with LJ in Season 4, though their whereabouts are unknown. The character is introduced to the series as a regular in the premiere episode of the third season of the series. Sof\u00eda Lugo is first seen posing as the wife of a dead inmate and a gravedigger, in order to get [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]]'s message written to her, transferred via the dead bodies. Sof\u00eda finds the note, which refers to a bank lock-box in a bank where a bird guide is contained. The book is then stolen by Lincoln Burrows and tells her to tell Whistler that he has it now. She meets Whistler in Sona, who keeps her in the dark about Scofield as he feared that Sof\u00eda might be killed if she knew too much. On her way out, she sees the visitation log, figures the connection and notes Lincoln's hotel and room number. She tails Lincoln to Saint Rita and confronts him. Lincoln tells her about the escape plan.\n\nIn \"[[Good Fences (Prison Break episode)|Good Fences]]\", Sof\u00eda meets Whistler who demands to know the truth. He relents, telling her of The Company's interest in him and telling her to gather information on the brothers. Afterwards she meets Lincoln at his hotel wanting to help in the escape. Lincoln enlists her as an impromptu translator for Lincoln and the grave digger. Sof\u00eda helps to bargain with the price of the car of the grave digger, who is killed shortly after by Gretchen. She also accompanies Lincoln to bury the scuba gear and provides assistance, such as helping to drug one of the guards and hatching the escape plan for Scofield and James Whistler. She seemed to not completely trust Lincoln but in \"[[Bang & Burn]]\", she discovers Whistler's other identity and house, which casts doubt into her mind. A romantic connection begins to appear between Lincoln and Sof\u00eda due to her problems of mistrust with her boyfriend James Whistler. Later, in an attempt to force Whistler to give the coordinates, Sof\u00eda is captured and tortured by Gretchen Morgan.\n\nIn the season finale, after the exchange, Sof\u00eda decided to break up with Whistler, when she realized that she could no longer trust him. Sof\u00eda was shot by one of The Company members in \"[[The Art of the Deal]]\", but has not yet given in to the extent of her injuries. As she recovers in the hospital, she tells Michael to retrieve a box from her apartment which she had found, containing files on a man named Jason Lief. As Michael leaves to find Whistler, Lincoln and LJ decided to stay back to take care of Sof\u00eda.\n\nSof\u00eda appears briefly in the premiere episode of season 4, shopping with Lincoln and LJ, but when Lincoln kills a Company agent and is arrested, Sof\u00eda and L.J. run for it.\n\nShe reappears in the finale of season 4. She is held captive by Company agents but is released unharmed by the General after Sucre and C-Note apprehend him. Four years later, she is shown to be romantically involved with Lincoln.\n\nSofia does not appear in season 5, but in \"Progeny\" Lincoln mentions that he and Sofia have broken up.\n\n=== Gretchen Morgan ===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Prison Break]]\n| colour             = #cccfff\n| image              = \n| name               = Gretchen Morgan\n| portrayer          = [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]\n| first              = \"[[Orientaci\u00f3n (Prison Break)|Orientaci\u00f3n]]\" (2007)\n| last               = ''[[Prison Break: The Final Break|The Final Break]]'' (2009)\n| alias              = Susan B.

Anthony, is introduced to the series in the third season as a high-ranking Company field-operative in charge of Whistler's breakout from Sona. Despite claiming to have killed Sara, season 4 revealed she lied and Sara is in fact alive. Gretchen finds herself in The Company's cross hairs after the Whistler/Scylla disaster and later is forced out of necessity to aid Self's \"A-Team\" against her former employers. She is ruthless and impatient, performing swift executions without hesitation if there is any obstacle to her plan, but is known to have a soft side for the few individuals that she cares about, for example her daughter. She is shown to be able to withstand torture and is exceptionally skilled in martial arts. Her character is mainly an antagonist, and later an occasional, uneasy ally to the protagonists. Gretchen is the main antagonist of the third season. The character is first seen covering scratch wounds on her face with makeup. Later, she meets up with Lincoln at a bar and informs him that The Company has kidnapped both [[Sara Tancredi|Sara]] and [[L.J. Burrows|LJ]], and that in order for them to survive, Michael must break James Whistler out of Sona prison. When Lincoln tries to rescue both of them, she claimed to have personally beheaded Sara and warned the brothers not to play games.<ref name=good>Good Fences</ref> Gretchen provides assistance to both of the brothers so that their plan would work, such as money for the gravedigger (whom she eventually executed as she suspected that he might report them to the police)<ref name=good/> and a drug that could help silence a guard.<ref name=photo/> When she finds out that Lincoln is trying to drug the guard much earlier than the hostage exchange time, she becomes furious and moves to behead the fearful [[L.J.

When the escape ultimately fails, Gretchen's supervisor, General Krantz, forced her to carry out the \"Bang and Burn\" Operation, which involved flying helicopters into Sona to retrieve Whistler. Due to Michael's intervention, this operation fails. Hoping that Lincoln could once again be included into the plan, Gretchen allowed Lincoln to meet his son at an abandoned shack. Michael's confession caused her to be subsequently tortured by [[waterboarding]] by Sona guards. However, Gretchen was able to escape from their clutches.<ref>Boxed In</ref> [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]] later revealed that her real name is Gretchen Morgan.<ref name=vamonos>Vamonos</ref> Following Michael and Whistler's escape from Sona, Gretchen was able to extract Whistler safely, but she failed to eliminate the brothers. In her final appearance of the season, she is seen driving away in a car with Whistler and Mahone (who had seemingly made a deal with Whistler to work for The Company after the escape).\n\nIn the season 4 premiere, Gretchen appears with Whistler on a mission to retrieve one of the Scylla cards, which fails when Whistler betrays The Company by stealing the original card, and Gretchen is punished by the general for her failure. Initially assumed dead, she is revealed to be alive at the end of \"Breaking and Entering\", locked away and tortured for information. She has only a minimal role in the next few episodes, but finally escapes custody in the fifth episode. \"Blow Out\" fleshes out her character when Gretchen takes shelter at her sister's house. It is revealed that Rita's child Emily is actually Gretchen's daughter, and the character shows her first hints of a softer side when they appear in scenes together. Following this, Gretchen recovers and enters the main plot to obtain Scylla. She tracks down T-Bag, who is in possession of Whistler's bird book, and forces him to co-operate. She eventually becomes a reluctant ally to Michael and his team, which includes Sara. In an effort to make amends with Sara, whom Gretchen tortured in Panama, she meets with her in \"The Price\" and offers her to get even by whipping Gretchen with a bull whip. Sara declines, instead stating that Gretchen will one day pay for the guard she murdered that helped Sara escape. In \"Greatness Achieved\", Gretchen is revealed to be a former lover of the General (who is also the father of her daughter, Emily) when she infiltrates his office with a gun seeking revenge. While she appears to soften at his manipulations, it is later revealed that she is merely playing along to gain inside information.\n\nGretchen and T-Bag serve mainly as wild cards in these episodes, playing Michael's team, with their real plan revealed to be using them to get Scylla, only to then steal it and sell it to a Chinese crime syndicate for 125 million. In their scenes together, Gretchen is often the more ruthless character, while T-Bag appears more hesitant as he grows attached to salesman Cole Pfeiffer, the alias he is living under to facilitate the break-in. In order to speed things along, Gretchen accepts the task of trying to steal the general's Scylla card by seducing him in \"Quite Riot\". He uncovers her true motivation, however, and she barely survives by pleading with him, confirming to the viewers that he is the father of her child. On the day of the break-in to steal Scylla, Gretchen and T-Bag stake out the Gate corporation with machine guns, preparing to ambush the team when they return. Gretchen and a reluctant T-Bag take the entire company hostage when someone spots her gun, and they are forced to flee when a federal agent arrives. In the next few episodes, Gretchen shares a plotline with Don Self, a Homeland Security agent that Michael's team reports to. After betraying the team and taking Scylla, Self threatens the life of Gretchen's daughter for her to help him find a new buyer. Gretchen complies and in \"Going Under\" they meet with the buyer, but fails when men appear to take them into Company custody. Following this, she is forced by the general to work with Self, Lincoln and T-Bag to recover Scylla. Her character is later written out when she is shot by the buyer and the rest of the team leave her behind to be arrested by the police.\n\nIn ''[[Prison Break: The Final Break|The Final Break]]'', Gretchen is shown to be an inmate in the prison that Sara is taken to, for the murder of Christina Scofield Hampton. When Gretchen sees Lincoln and Sucre standing outside the prison, she demands that Sara take her along in any escape plan they may be developing. While initially threatening, Gretchen eventually reveals to Sara that she simply desires to see her daughter, Emily, and to give her a necklace which she made herself. She proves her loyalty by saving Sara from an attacker looking to collect a bounty put out by the General, who is incarcerated in a neighboring prison. When the escape commences, Gretchen attacks a guard and gets stabbed in the leg. Knowing that she cannot escape without help, Gretchen asks Sara to choose to either leave her behind or help her, and Sara lends her hand. Finally, as Sara and Gretchen are on their way, Gretchen is spotted by guards. When asked whether or not she is alone, Gretchen refuses to reveal Sara's presence, and gets taken back into custody. This is the last time she is seen. Before leaving however, Sara sees the necklace Gretchen made for her daughter on the ground, and, knowing she would have been caught had Gretchen betrayed her, Sara secures it, so that she may pass it along to Emily.\n\n=== Donald Self ===\nDonald \"Don\" Self (played by  [[Michael Rapaport]]) is an [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement#Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)|ICE Homeland Security Investigations]] ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]]) special agent introduced in the [[Scylla (Prison Break episode)|fourth-season premiere]]. After their arrest, he recruits the protagonists and several other characters into a covert \"A-Team\" of sorts in a mission to take down The Company once and for all. The character plays a prominent role in the last season. Not much is known about him but he is stated as a hardworking Homeland Security Agent who tries to bring down The Company but has yet to be successful. He has worked for five years to bring down The Company with [[List of Prison Break characters#James Whistler|James Whistler]] and [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Other conspiracy characters|Aldo Burrows]] (Michael and Lincoln's father), the latter has also tried to locate Scylla. According to a background check made on the character by The Company in the episode \"Five the Hard Way\", Self studied law on Long Island, before spending the next 18 years moving around DOD and DOJ. He began working for Homeland Security in 2002. Agent Self later told Mahone that he had a wife that died while giving birth - his unborn infant died too. A picture of his wife is seen at his desk several times and he once played a message of her voice at his answering machine.<ref name=\"Scylla\">[[Scylla (Prison Break)|Scylla]]</ref><ref>[[Greatness Achieved (Prison Break)|Greatness Achieved]]</ref> The truth about his wife's fate is revealed near the end of the season. Self's character plays the role of supervisor and ally to the team in the first half of the season, but later becomes an antagonist. In \"Scylla\", he tasks Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield with the mission of bringing down The Company and finding \"Scylla\", a key card that stores a wealth of information about The Company. He promises them full exoneration if the brothers can obtain Scylla and hand it over to the government. As [[Fernando Sucre|Sucre]], [[Alexander Mahone|Mahone]], [[Brad Bellick|Bellick]], [[Sara Tancredi|Sara]], and Roland Glenn, a computer hijacker, come along with them, Self points out that if they do it there is no coming back and that he is their boss.<ref name=\"Scylla\"/><ref>[[Breaking & Entering (Prison Break)|Breaking & Entering]]</ref> The partnership with Self is not without friction, however. Most notably in \"Shut Down\" were Self, under pressure from his boss, reluctantly tries to cancel the mission after it is discovered that Scylla is six key cards, not just one. Self agrees to let them find the rest of the Scylla cards after the team successfully identifies the other cardholders.<ref>[[Shut Down (Prison Break)|Shut Down]]</ref> In other episodes throughout the season, however, the character provides active assistance to the team, like in \"Safe and Sound\" where Self, although overtly pessimistic about their chances, agree to help by first contriving an excuse to enter a cardholder's office and later in the episode by luring someone out of his office for lunch, leaving the team to get to a safe which contains a Scylla card.<ref>[[Safe & Sound (Prison Break)|Safe & Sound]]</ref> He also has his computer analysts identify the rest of the cardholders from the picture taken with Michael's cell phone.\n\nWhen General Krantz, the leader of The Company, discovers Self had images of him enhanced, Wyatt confronts Self and tells him that the General \"likes his privacy.\"<ref>[[Blow Out (Prison Break)|Blow Out]]</ref> Taking Mahone's advice; to get aggressive, Self meets the General face-to-face and blackmails him, threatening to reveal to the public missions he was involved in, thus making it harder for The Company to remain covert.<ref>[[Five the Hard Way (Prison Break)|Five the Hard Way]]</ref> As the season unfolds, Self's character begins to show tendencies of a more ruthless side. He often threatens to kill those who oppose him, and in \"Blow Out\", after Mahone becomes a liability to the mission by getting arrested by the police, Self wants to have Mahone killed, something Michael refuses to do. Instead the team rescue Mahone, without Self's assistance. In \"The Legend\" the team grows a dislike for Self when he seems unwilling to hold up his end of the deal and send Bellick's body home after he died in the previous episode. However, in \"Quiet Riot\", he is actively supportive of the mission and seems to genuinely want to bring down The Company. Self's character shows his true colours in the episode \"Selfless,\" where he apparently works with the team as they finally manage to recover the Scylla, but ultimately betrays both them and his government superiors by stealing the recovered Scylla and keeping it for himself. His real character motivation is revealed to be finding a 'buyer' for Scylla, an apparently private interest. Realizing that the needs to find a new buyer after the first one is killed, Self murders his partner, federal agent Miriam Holtz, in cold blood in order to get to T-Bag, a prisoner she was guarding. From this point onwards, the character begins to share a more active role in the plot by being out in the field and appearing in more action-oriented scenes. In the next few episodes, he is an antagonist to Michael and the rest of the team. After faking his death and attempting to frame Michael's team for it in \"Deal or No Deal\", Self uses T-Bag to track down the family of Gretchen Morgan, a former Company operative that has gone rogue. Self threatens the life of her daughter to gain her co-operation and the two characters share the same plotline for the next few episodes, as they use Gretchen's contacts to find another buyer for Scylla. However, at the end of the episode, Self finds himself with a problem: the mistrust of Michael Scofield, who removed a part of the Scylla device. While his apprehension of T-Bag led to Gretchen and a buyer, he cannot sell Scylla while it is incomplete. Thus, the episode ends with him ultimately demanding the missing part of Scylla from Michael, who instead suggests he \"Come and get it\".\n\nIn the next episode, \"Just Business\" Self seemingly makes a deal with Michael to sell Scylla together, while both parties are actually plotting against each other. Self and Gretchen plants an x-ray device in the warehouse to try to find the missing piece of scylla while the team are planning to take the rest of Scylla back from Self. In the end it is Self who is successful, as he and Gretchen obtains the missing piece and head out to meet Gretchen's contact, a conduit named Vikan. Self's character is again shown to be ruthless when, after asking Vikan if the buyer of Scylla is coming, Self shoots Vikan and his bodyguards and tosses their corpse into the sea so that he doesn\u2019t have to share a cut of the money with them. Self is next seen waiting with Gretchen for the Scylla buyer. After getting a call from Gretchen's sister, Rita, Gretchen tells Self that The Company has T-Bag and unfortunately he might have told The Company where they are. So before Lincoln and Sucre could track them, Self and Gretchen destroy their cell phones and flee. They're next seen at a phone store and look injured with bloody scratches on their faces. They buy a new phone and tell the store owner not to tell anyone they were there. They head to the warehouse to wait for the buyer. The buyer arrives and Self and Gretchen hold the buyer at gunpoint. Gretchen forces Self to hand Scylla to the buyer or they will be in grave danger. Self hands over Scylla. They hear noise and Self and Gretchen go to investigate, but are betrayed by the buyer when he points his gun at them and they run for cover and a shootout occurs. The buyer shoots Self in the shoulder and flees with the money and Scylla. Later they are to work with Lincoln and T-Bag to recover Scylla. Self's character plays a less prominent role in the season's final episodes, where he works with his new team to find Scylla and track down the new buyer, which turns out to be Lincoln and Michael's mother, Christina Rose Scofield. When the team fails in their assignment, the general decides to punish them by ordering the death of one of their family members and singles out Self's wife, who is actually alive and in a [[persistent vegetative state]] due to Self's drunk and reckless behavior. Self then escapes, but gets arrested when at the hospital, where one of Christina's men injects him with a serum that gradually leaves him in the same state his wife was in. He refuses to help federal agents with locating Burrows and Scofield because they failed at protecting him, and is left in his vegetative state for the rest of his life. In his final appearance in the epilogue of the Series Finale, set four years after the events of the rest of the episode, Self is revealed to be living at a rest facility, using a wheelchair, mute and drooling.\n\n=== Jacob Anton Ness/Poseidon ===\nJacob Anton Ness (played by [[Mark Feuerstein]]) is an economics professor at University of Syracuse, and Sara's second husband and Mike's stepfather. He and Sara were married sometime during the seven years after Michael's supposed death. In the season premiere, he is shot in the leg by someone supposedly sent to kill Sara and Mike due to Lincoln investigating Michael's death, and spends the next two episodes recovering in the hospital. During this time, Sara finds out Michael is still alive under the name Kaniel Outis, and tells him. He tells her that Michael may have succumbed to madness due to the choices he made. After being released, he, Sara and Mike lie low at his parents' lake house per Sara's choice, though he says the university has resources that can be used to find their attackers. T-Bag eventually tracks the attackers to a meeting with him. Sara confronts him on this, and he claims he was paying them off to leave him alone, and later seems to prove this by having them arrested with a tracker in the money, forgiving Sara for her paranoia. However, Michael later reveals him to be \"Poseidon\", a rogue CIA agent that he has been working for in exchange for exoneration of himself and others. Michael also reveals that he murdered the CIA agent Michael's alias is accused of having murdered. Sara returns to New York and tries to pretend she does not know, but he sees through this immediately, and captures her and Mike. Michael, Lincoln and their contacts try to catch him, and manage to track him to his lake house, but he seemingly turns the tables and has one of his subordinates ambush Michael and Mike, with Sara's fate unknown. He is ultimately caught and incarcerated at Fox River, where he is attacked by T-Bag as retribution for Whip's death.\n\n=== Sheba ===\nSheba (played by [[Inbar Lavi]]) is a woman who leads a resistance movement in Yemen, and C-Note's contact when he and Lincoln arrive. She allows the two to visit Ogygia, and later helps them rescue a man who can help them facilitate Michael's escape, as well as his daughter and several schoolgirls, from [[ISIL]]. She and Lincoln later attempt to get fake passports, but are captured, and she is nearly raped by a one-eyed man who had a crush on her in high school, but is saved by Lincoln. She and C-Note bring the people they saved from ISIL to an airport and manage to get on board a small plane, but are forced to leave without Michael, Lincoln and their fellow escapees. They make it to Jordan, and eventually back to the States, where she and C-Note regroup with Michael and Lincoln, and help them track down Poseidon and his subordinates to find Sara and Mike. Eventually, when Michael figures out where they are, Lincoln kisses her and sends her back to take care of the others, claiming he could not forgive himself if something happened to her.\n\n=== David \"Whip' Martin ===\nDavid \"Whip\" Martin (played by [[Augustus Prew]]) is first introduced as Michael's cellmate in Ogygia in season 5. He is quickly revealed to know that Michael is not Kaniel Outis, and that he and Michael have been breaking people out of prisons around the world for years. Michael repeatedly calls him his (Michael's) whip-hand, hence his nickname. He is loyal to Michael despite not knowing his real name, but as their time in Ogygia goes on and their escape plan doesn't seem to be working, he starts to become more paranoid that Michael will betray him, which only increases when Abu Ramal, the prisoner they are in Ogygia to break out, is released from solitary confinement. Michael repeatedly tells him he will not leave him, but he continues to be frightened, even fighting Michael and forcing a guard to break them up (though this is part of Michael's plan). He confronts Michael during the escape, where Michael finally reveals his plan to leave Ramal behind, satisfying Whip. However, the escape fails, and he, Michael, Ramal and their cellmate Ja are thrown into solitary confinement, where he starts to become paranoid once again as [[ISIL]] strikes land closer to the prison. After Michael convinces Ramal to help them escape, he and Ja are released from their cells when Michael gets the keys. They try to persuade Michael to leave Ramal behind, but Michael admits he is necessary. Eventually the four escape the prison along with Sid, another inmate, and formulate a plan to double-cross Ramal, but he turns the tables on them. Whip tells Ramal he was arrested for killing a man in a barfight, and when they are surprised by Lincoln, he takes the opportunity to kill Ramal, which ends up backfiring. With ISIL hunting them, he continues to follow Michael, now knowing his real name, despite two of their plans for escape failing. Eventually the group tries to escape across the desert to Phaecia, a small fishing village, and Whip kills several ISIL members following them. He accompanies Michael and Lincoln to [[Crete, Greece]], and expresses his admiration for an injured Michael. He then accompanies them on to a freighter, arranged by Sucre, back to the States. When they are caught by NAVY Seals, he escapes with Michael, Lincoln and Sucre in a life raft, and is taken by fishing boat to France, from where Michael instead sends him to Chicago instead of New York. During this time, it is revealed that his real name is David Martin, and that he was a survivor in prison, which is why Michael chose him as his partner (and the cover story he told Ramal may have been why he was originally incarcerated). In Chicago, he follows coordinates given by Michael to Lake Michigan, where he meets T-Bag. T-Bag reveals that he is in fact his father, which is the reason why he Michael made him his whip-hand.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Prison Break minor characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/bios/ Official characters' biographies] at Fox's ''Prison Break'' website\n\n{{Prison Break}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prison Break Characters, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of Prison Break characters|Characters]]\n", "name_user": "Bdijkstra", "label": "safe", "comment": "please preserve <onlyinclude>", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prison_Break_characters"}
