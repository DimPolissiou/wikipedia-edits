Born to a well-off and highly musical family in [[Dublin]], Stanford was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]] before studying music in [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Leipzig]] and Berlin. He was instrumental in raising the status of the [[Cambridge University Musical Society]], attracting international stars to perform with it.\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Stanford was appointed organist of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. In 1882, aged 29, he was one of the founding professors of the [[Royal College of Music]], where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also [[Professor of Music (Cambridge)|Professor of Music at Cambridge]]. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as [[Gustav Holst]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the [[The Bach Choir|Bach Choir]] and the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds triennial music festival]].\n\nStanford composed a substantial number of concert works, including seven symphonies, but his best-remembered pieces are his choral works for church performance, chiefly composed in the [[Anglican church music|Anglican tradition]]. He was a dedicated composer of opera, but none of his nine completed operas has endured in the general repertory. Some critics regarded Stanford, together with [[Hubert Parry]] and [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], as responsible for a [[English Musical Renaissance|renaissance]] in music from the British Isles. However, after his conspicuous success as a composer in the last two decades of the 19th century, his music was eclipsed in the 20th century by that of [[Edward Elgar]] as well as former pupils.\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:CVStanford's Parents.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=cameos, head only, of a Victorian man and woman in left profile|Stanford's parents, John and Mary Stanford]]\n[[File:CVStanford-aetat-12.jpg|thumb|alt=young lad in Victorian dress, sitting at a desk|200px|Stanford aged 12]]\nStanford was born in [[Dublin]], the only son of John James Stanford and his second wife, Mary, ''n\u00e9e'' Henn.<ref name=grove>Dibble, Jeremy.

In Dibble's view, the frequent charge that Stanford is \"Brahms and water\" was disproved once the symphonies, concertos, much of the chamber music and many of the songs became available for reappraisal when recorded for compact disc.<ref>Dibble, p. 464</ref> In 2002, Rodmell's study of Stanford included a discography running to 16 pages.<ref name=disco>Rodmell, Appendix Two, unnumbered pages</ref>\n\nThe criticism most often made of Stanford's music by writers from Shaw onwards is that his music lacks passion.<ref name=r415>Rodmell, p. 415</ref> Shaw praised \"Stanford the Celt\" and abominated \"Stanford the Professor\", who reined in the emotions of the [[Celt]].<ref name=r415/> In Stanford's church music, the critic Nicholas Temperley finds \"a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience, but one that is perhaps lacking in deeply felt religious impulse.\"<ref name=t205/> In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do so.<ref>Rodmell, p. 416</ref> Like Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford had a real gift,<ref>Rodmell, p. 413</ref> but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that \"only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity.\"<ref>Rodmell, p. 417</ref>\n\n=== Orchestral ===\nThe commentator Richard Whitehouse writes that Stanford's seven symphonies embody both the strengths and limitations of his music, displaying \"a compositional rigour and expertise matched only by his older contemporary ... [[Hubert Parry|Parry]], while seeming content to remain well within the stylistic ambit of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].\" Whitehouse comments that although Stanford's symphonic construction is conventional, \"an often subtle approach to movement forms and resourceful orchestration make his symphonies worth exploring.\"<ref name=naxos>Whitehouse, Richard (2008).

[https://books.google.de/books?id=VevXghb1SwoC&pg=PA302 302]</ref> Writing of the First String Quintet, Porte calls it a sonorous and warm-hearted sort of work, constructed on fairly classical lines, and notes that the character and construction are typical of the composer. Porte comments similarly on other chamber works, including the Second Piano Trio: \"This is a typical Stanfordian work. It is sonorously scored, classical in outlook, and contains many passages of an expressive and somewhat poetical freshness. There are no very special features to note, but the work is one that makes a useful and interesting item.\"<ref>Porte, p. 69</ref>\n\n=== Church music ===\nThe general neglect of Stanford's music in the years after his death did not extend to his ecclesiastical works. In ''Music in Britain'', one of the few books to deal with Stanford's music in detail,<ref>Rodmell, p. 414</ref> Nicholas Temperley writes that it is due to Stanford that settings of the [[service (music)|Anglican church services]] regained their \"full place beside the anthem as a worthy object of artistic invention.\"<ref>Temperley, p. 204</ref> Vaughan Williams ranked the ''Stabat Mater'' as one of Stanford's works of \"imperishable beauty\".<ref name=pupils/> In Temperley's view, Stanford's services in A (1880), F (1889) and C (1909) are the most important and enduring additions from those years to the cathedral repertory.<ref name=t205>Temperley, p. 205</ref> As with his concert works, Stanford's music is dominated by melody. The bass line, in Rodmell's view, is always important yet secondary and anything in between was regarded as \"filling.\"<ref>Rodmell, p. 374</ref>\n\n=== Operas ===\nIn a 1981 survey of Stanford's operas, the critic Nigel Burton writes that ''Shamus O'Brien'' lacks good tunes, and that the only memorable melody in it is not by Stanford but is an English folk song, \"The Glory of the West.\"<ref name=burton>Burton, p. 349</ref> Burton is more dismissive of ''The Critic'', which he describes as \"a poor man's ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.\"<ref name=burton/> Dibble rates ''The Critic'' much higher, considering it to be one of Stanford's two best operas.<ref name=grove/> In 1921, Porte wrote that it contains music that is \"remarkably fresh, melodious and thoroughly individual in character and outlook. The vocal and instrumental writing is done with consummate skill.\"<ref>Porte, p. 107</ref> Burton praises ''Much Ado About Nothing'', judging it to contain some of Stanford's best operatic music. He rates the last of the composer's operas, ''The Travelling Companion'' as his finest operatic achievement, though Burton credits much of its power to the brilliant story adapted by [[Henry Newbolt]] from [[Hans Christian Andersen|Hans Andersen]].<ref name=burton/> Porte writes that the music is often solemn and romantic, and curiously impressive.<ref>Porte, p. 111</ref> [[Christopher Webber]] writes that it has \"an atmosphere not quite like any other: ''The Travelling Companion'' has timeless qualities ... [which] could go far to enhance Stanford's reputation as an opera composer\".<ref>Christopher Webber, 'Charles Villiers Stanford - An Operatic Chameleon', ''Opera'', November 2018, pp.1352-1356</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nAlthough much of Stanford's music is neglected in the concert hall, a considerable amount has been recorded. Complete cycles of the symphonies have been recorded for the [[Chandos Records|Chandos]] and [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] labels, under the conductors [[Vernon Handley]] and [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]]. Other orchestral works recorded for CD include the six ''Irish Rhapsodies'', the Clarinet Concerto, the Second Piano Concerto and the Second Violin Concerto.<ref name=disco/>\n\nStanford's church music is well represented on disc. In his 2002 discography, Rodmell lists 14 versions of the Service in B{{music|flat}}, alongside multiple recordings of the Services in A, F and C, the three motets Op. 38 and the composer's setting of \"The Lord is my Shepherd.\"<ref name=disco/> A 1926 disc of his Magnificat in G by [[Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]] was the first recording of a boy soprano soloist using an electrical microphone.<ref>{{cite web|title=First electrical recording of a Boy Soprano solo at St George's Windsor 1926|publisher=Archive of Recorded Church Music|accessdate=24 January 2019|url=https://recordedchurchmusic.org/historic-recordings/firstsolo}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor|others=Directed by [[Edmund Fellowes]], organist [[Malcolm Boyle]]|title=Stanford, Magnificat in G|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]|id=9175|type=12\" record|year=1926}}</ref>\n\nSecular songs recorded by several artists include \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\", performed by [[Janet Baker]] among others, \"An Irish Idyll\", whose interpreters have included [[Kathleen Ferrier]], and ''Songs of the Sea'' in recordings by such singers as [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]].<ref name=disco/> Among the chamber works that have received several recordings are the Three Intermezzi for Clarinet and Piano, the Clarinet Sonata, and the two string quartets.<ref name=disco/> Rodmell's discography lists none of Stanford's operas.<ref name=disco/>\n\n== Notes and references ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=24em}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|last=Ainger|first=Michael|year=2002|title=Gilbert and Sullivan \u2013 A Dual Biography|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514769-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Beecham|first=Thomas|title=A Mingled Chime|location=London|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1959|oclc=470511334}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Opera 1864\u20131914|title=Music in Britain \u2013 The Romantic Age 1800\u20131914|author=Burton, Nigel|editor=Nicholas Temperley|location=London|publisher=Athlone Press|year=1981|isbn=0-485-13005-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dibble|first=Jeremy|year=2002|title=Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816383-5}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Eatock|first=Colin|title=The Crystal Palace Concerts: Canon Formation and the English Musical Renaissance|year=2010|journal=19th-Century Music|volume=34|issue=1|pages=87\u2013105|issn=0148-2076|doi=10.1525/ncm.2010.34.1.087}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Jacobs|year=1986|title=Arthur Sullivan \u2013 A Victorian Musician|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-282033-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Arthur|title=Henry J.

Born to a well-off and highly musical family in [[Dublin]], Stanford was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]] before studying music in [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Leipzig]] and Berlin. He was instrumental in raising the status of the [[Cambridge University Musical Society]], attracting international stars to perform with it.\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Stanford was appointed organist of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. In 1882, aged 29, he was one of the founding professors of the [[Royal College of Music]], where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also [[Professor of Music (Cambridge)|Professor of Music at Cambridge]]. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as [[Gustav Holst]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the [[The Bach Choir|Bach Choir]] and the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds triennial music festival]].\n\nStanford composed a substantial number of concert works, including seven symphonies, but his best-remembered pieces are his choral works for church performance, chiefly composed in the [[Anglican church music|Anglican tradition]]. He was a dedicated composer of opera, but none of his nine completed operas has endured in the general repertory. Some critics regarded Stanford, together with [[Hubert Parry]] and [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], as responsible for a [[English Musical Renaissance|renaissance]] in music from the British Isles. However, after his conspicuous success as a composer in the last two decades of the 19th century, his music was eclipsed in the 20th century by that of [[Edward Elgar]] as well as former pupils.\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:CVStanford's Parents.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=cameos, head only, of a Victorian man and woman in left profile|Stanford's parents, John and Mary Stanford]]\n[[File:CVStanford-aetat-12.jpg|thumb|alt=young lad in Victorian dress, sitting at a desk|200px|Stanford aged 12]]\nStanford was born in [[Dublin]], the only son of John James Stanford and his second wife, Mary, ''n\u00e9e'' Henn.<ref name=grove>Dibble, Jeremy.

The first, from his Leipzig years, is unnumbered; it pre-dates by three years the [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|concerto]] in the same key by Brahms.</ref> are in their orchestration and their lyricism as much in the tradition of Mendelssohn as of Brahms, with whom Stanford's music is often compared.<ref name=grove/>\n\n=== Chamber works ===\nStanford's chamber music, which as Dibble notes even Shaw praised, has not entered the general repertoire, but is well crafted.<ref name=grove/> Dibble singles out the Three Intermezzi for clarinet and piano (1879), the [[Serenade in F major (Stanford)|Serenade (Nonet)]] of 1905, and the Clarinet Sonata (1911) with its touching lament.<ref name=grove/> Dibble writes about Stanford's [[Violin Sonata No. 2 (Stanford)|Violin Sonata No. 2]]. composed c. 1898 after studies in Germany, that \"the seamless sonata construction gives the impression of a free form\".<ref>dibble, p. [https://books.google.de/books?id=VevXghb1SwoC&pg=PA302 302]</ref> Writing of the First String Quintet, Porte calls it a sonorous and warm-hearted sort of work, constructed on fairly classical lines, and notes that the character and construction are typical of the composer. Porte comments similarly on other chamber works, including the Second Piano Trio: \"This is a typical Stanfordian work. It is sonorously scored, classical in outlook, and contains many passages of an expressive and somewhat poetical freshness. There are no very special features to note, but the work is one that makes a useful and interesting item.\"<ref>Porte, p. 69</ref>\n\n=== Church music ===\nThe general neglect of Stanford's music in the years after his death did not extend to his ecclesiastical works. In ''Music in Britain'', one of the few books to deal with Stanford's music in detail,<ref>Rodmell, p. 414</ref> Nicholas Temperley writes that it is due to Stanford that settings of the [[service (music)|Anglican church services]] regained their \"full place beside the anthem as a worthy object of artistic invention.\"<ref>Temperley, p. 204</ref> Vaughan Williams ranked the ''Stabat Mater'' as one of Stanford's works of \"imperishable beauty\".<ref name=pupils/> In Temperley's view, Stanford's services in A (1880), F (1889) and C (1909) are the most important and enduring additions from those years to the cathedral repertory.<ref name=t205>Temperley, p. 205</ref> As with his concert works, Stanford's music is dominated by melody. The bass line, in Rodmell's view, is always important yet secondary and anything in between was regarded as \"filling.\"<ref>Rodmell, p. 374</ref>\n\n=== Operas ===\nIn a 1981 survey of Stanford's operas, the critic Nigel Burton writes that ''Shamus O'Brien'' lacks good tunes, and that the only memorable melody in it is not by Stanford but is an English folk song, \"The Glory of the West.\"<ref name=burton>Burton, p. 349</ref> Burton is more dismissive of ''The Critic'', which he describes as \"a poor man's ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.\"<ref name=burton/> Dibble rates ''The Critic'' much higher, considering it to be one of Stanford's two best operas.<ref name=grove/> In 1921, Porte wrote that it contains music that is \"remarkably fresh, melodious and thoroughly individual in character and outlook. The vocal and instrumental writing is done with consummate skill.\"<ref>Porte, p. 107</ref> Burton praises ''Much Ado About Nothing'', judging it to contain some of Stanford's best operatic music. He rates the last of the composer's operas, ''The Travelling Companion'' as his finest operatic achievement, though Burton credits much of its power to the brilliant story adapted by [[Henry Newbolt]] from [[Hans Christian Andersen|Hans Andersen]].<ref name=burton/> Porte writes that the music is often solemn and romantic, and curiously impressive.<ref>Porte, p. 111</ref> [[Christopher Webber]] writes that it has \"an atmosphere not quite like any other: ''The Travelling Companion'' has timeless qualities ... [which] could go far to enhance Stanford's reputation as an opera composer\".<ref>Christopher Webber, 'Charles Villiers Stanford - An Operatic Chameleon', ''Opera'', November 2018, pp.1352-1356</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nAlthough much of Stanford's music is neglected in the concert hall, a considerable amount has been recorded. Complete cycles of the symphonies have been recorded for the [[Chandos Records|Chandos]] and [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] labels, under the conductors [[Vernon Handley]] and [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]]. Other orchestral works recorded for CD include the six ''Irish Rhapsodies'', the Clarinet Concerto, the Second Piano Concerto and the Second Violin Concerto.<ref name=disco/>\n\nStanford's church music is well represented on disc. In his 2002 discography, Rodmell lists 14 versions of the Service in B{{music|flat}}, alongside multiple recordings of the Services in A, F and C, the three motets Op. 38 and the composer's setting of \"The Lord is my Shepherd.\"<ref name=disco/> A 1926 disc of his Magnificat in G by [[Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]] was the first recording of a boy soprano soloist using an electrical microphone.<ref>{{cite web|title=First electrical recording of a Boy Soprano solo at St George's Windsor 1926|publisher=Archive of Recorded Church Music|accessdate=24 January 2019|url=https://recordedchurchmusic.org/historic-recordings/firstsolo}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor|others=Directed by [[Edmund Fellowes]], organist [[Malcolm Boyle]]|title=Stanford, Magnificat in G|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]|id=9175|type=12\" record|year=1926}}</ref>\n\nSecular songs recorded by several artists include \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\", performed by [[Janet Baker]] among others, \"An Irish Idyll\", whose interpreters have included [[Kathleen Ferrier]], and ''Songs of the Sea'' in recordings by such singers as [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]].<ref name=disco/> Among the chamber works that have received several recordings are the Three Intermezzi for Clarinet and Piano, the Clarinet Sonata, and the two string quartets.<ref name=disco/> Rodmell's discography lists none of Stanford's operas.<ref name=disco/>\n\n== Notes and references ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=24em}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|last=Ainger|first=Michael|year=2002|title=Gilbert and Sullivan \u2013 A Dual Biography|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514769-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Beecham|first=Thomas|title=A Mingled Chime|location=London|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1959|oclc=470511334}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Opera 1864\u20131914|title=Music in Britain \u2013 The Romantic Age 1800\u20131914|author=Burton, Nigel|editor=Nicholas Temperley|location=London|publisher=Athlone Press|year=1981|isbn=0-485-13005-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dibble|first=Jeremy|year=2002|title=Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816383-5}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Eatock|first=Colin|title=The Crystal Palace Concerts: Canon Formation and the English Musical Renaissance|year=2010|journal=19th-Century Music|volume=34|issue=1|pages=87\u2013105|issn=0148-2076|doi=10.1525/ncm.2010.34.1.087}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Jacobs|year=1986|title=Arthur Sullivan \u2013 A Victorian Musician|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-282033-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Arthur|title=Henry J.

With the assistance and oversight of the British Gliding Association the glider was certified to JAR-22 standards in October 1994, and called the Me-7 (Mechta 7) for European sales. A production quality-control problem was identified in 1999 and European sales ended at that time.  \n\nThe American team at the World Class competition was very impressed with the Russian design, thought it would sell well for [[Club class]] and student solo flying and bought one of the three prototypes to take home with them. The aircraft proved popular and so a US distributorship under the name ''Russia 12.6'' was set up to sell the Russian production. Since the Aircraft Cooperative Mechta could not mass-produce the aircraft they reformed as Aviastroitel. In 1994 US distribution was transferred to ''Mechta Sailplanes, LLC'', which imported 18 Russia gliders. Aviastroitel created a second set of molds to respond to the demand and started a second assembly line with a total production capacity of 48 AC-4s per year. In 1997 William Ayd became US distributor under the name ''Russia Sailplanes, Inc.'' Production of the AC-4 was suspended in 2003 when the Russian government changed the requirements for industrial production, making building them  uneconomical.

Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman scientist]], and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being f\u00eated and seeking experts to describe the collections.

After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt.

Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s \"warring of the species\" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the \"final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes\", so that \"One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\"<ref name=JvW /><ref name=\"134e\">{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e\u2013135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This would result in the formation of new species.<ref name=JvW /><ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264\u2013265}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385\u2013388}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&viewtype=text&pageseq=39 7]}}</ref> As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''\n\n{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.

[[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was still firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a \"big book on species\" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his \"note on Man\". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, \"so surrounded with prejudices\", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that \"I go much further than you.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412\u2013441, 457\u2013458, 462\u2013463}}<br />{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283\u2013284, 290\u2013292, 295}}</ref>\n\nDarwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection.

To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,<ref>{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8\u201314}}</ref> and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.<ref name=miles /> Though he thought of religion as a [[tribe|tribal]] survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of [[deism|God as an ultimate lawgiver]].

He grew up in a family of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported [[Reform Act 1832|electoral reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation of slaves]]. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as \"a very pleasant and intelligent man\", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196\u2013198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century,<ref name=eddy /> but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against \"ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species\", and against ill-treatment of native people.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkins|2008|pp=408\u2013413}}</ref>{{Ref label|G|VII|none}} Darwins interaction with [[Yaghan]]s (Fuegians) such as [[Jemmy Button]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle]] had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to [[Tierra del Fuego]] he made a colourful description of \"[[Fuegian]] savages\".<ref name=Rozzi2018/> This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.<ref name=Rozzi2018>{{cite journal |last1=Rozzi |first1=Ricardo|author-link=Ricardo Rozzi |date=2018 |title=Transformaciones del pensamiento de Darwin en cabo de hornos: Un legado para la ciencia y la etica ambiental|trans-title=Transformations of Darwin\u2019s thought in cape horn: A legacy for science and environmental ethics |language=Spanish |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= 267\u2013277|doi=10.4067/S0718-22442018000100267 }}</ref> While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] detailing 32-thousand words.<ref name=Rozzi2018/> He recognised that European colonisation often led to the extinction of native civilisations.<ref name=barta>{{cite journal |first=Tony|last=Barta|title=Mr Darwin's shooters: on natural selection and the naturalizing of genocide|journal=Patterns of Prejudice |volume=39|issue=2|pages=116\u2013137 |doi=10.1080/00313220500106170 |date=2 June 2005 }}</ref>\n\nHe thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in her 1875 book ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.<ref name=Vandermassen>{{cite journal |author=Vandermassen, Griet |title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |year=2004 |volume=11 |issue=9 |doi=10.1177/1350506804039812 |pages=11\u201313 |ref=harv |citeseerx=10.1.1.550.3672 }}</ref>\n\nDarwin was intrigued by his [[half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, \"the noblest part of our nature\", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a \"caste\" of \"those who are naturally gifted\", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it \"the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race\", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556\u2013557, 572, 598}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=180 167\u2013173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.2&pageseq=419 402\u2013403]}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009}}</ref> Francis Galton named this field of study \"[[eugenics]]\" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}} After Darwin's death, his theories were cited to promote eugenic policies that went against his humanitarian principles.<ref name=barta/>\n\n==Evolutionary social movements==\n[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]\n{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}\nDarwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.\n\n[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families; this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].<ref name=wm>{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}<br />{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}</ref> Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included \"dependence of one being on another\"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223\u2013225}}</ref> Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in \"positive eugenics\". During the \"[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]\", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the \"feebleminded\" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}\n\nThe term \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the [[laissez-faire conservatism]] of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}<br />{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}</ref><ref name=wm />\n\n==Works==\n{{details|Charles Darwin bibliography}}\n\nDarwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}<br />{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}<br />{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s \"warring of the species\" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the \"final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes\", so that \"One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\"<ref name=JvW /><ref name=\"134e\">{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e\u2013135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This would result in the formation of new species.<ref name=JvW /><ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264\u2013265}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385\u2013388}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&viewtype=text&pageseq=39 7]}}</ref> As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''\n\n{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.

[[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was still firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a \"big book on species\" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his \"note on Man\". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, \"so surrounded with prejudices\", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that \"I go much further than you.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412\u2013441, 457\u2013458, 462\u2013463}}<br />{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283\u2013284, 290\u2013292, 295}}</ref>\n\nDarwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection.

His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as \"a very pleasant and intelligent man\", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196\u2013198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans.

In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, \"the noblest part of our nature\", and factors such as education could be more important.

Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included \"dependence of one being on another\"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223\u2013225}}</ref> Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in \"positive eugenics\". During the \"[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]\", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the \"feebleminded\" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws, followed by several other countries.

Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"<ref name=\"light on man\" />\n\nIn \"Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory\" he referred to [[sexual selection]]: \"I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.\"<ref name=SS_man />\n\nIn ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:\n\"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text 1]}}</ref> In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: \"it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&itemID=F944&viewtype=text vi]}}</ref>\n\n'''{{small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M.

As the eldest son and [[heir apparent]] of [[Henry VII of England]], Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established [[House of Tudor]]. His mother, [[Elizabeth of York]], was the daughter of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the [[House of York]].\n\nPlans for Arthur's marriage began before his third birthday; he was installed as Prince of Wales two years later. At the age of eleven, he was formally betrothed to [[Catherine of Aragon]], a daughter of the powerful [[Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain, in an effort to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. Arthur was well educated and, contrary to some modern belief, was in good health for the majority of his life. Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501, the couple took up residence at [[Ludlow Castle]] in [[Shropshire]], where Arthur died six months later of an unknown ailment. Catherine later firmly stated that the marriage had not been [[consummated]].\n\nOne year after Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's younger brother [[Henry VIII of England|Henry]], who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's untimely death paved the way for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The question as to the potential consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the [[Church of England]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\n== Infancy ==\n[[File:Family-of-Henry-VII.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The family of Henry VII, depicted on an illuminated page.]]\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] became [[King of England]] upon defeating [[Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485. In an effort to strengthen the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] claim to the throne, Henry had royal genealogists trace his lineage back to the ancient British rulers and decided on naming his firstborn son after the legendary [[King Arthur]]. On this occasion, [[Camelot]] was identified as present-day [[Winchester]],{{sfn|Wagner|Schmid|2011|p=1104}} and his wife, [[Elizabeth of York]], was sent to Saint Swithun's Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) in order to give birth there.{{sfn|Wheeler|Kindrick|Salda|2000|p=377}} Born at [[Winchester Cathedral Priory|Saint Swithun's Priory]]<ref name=\"odnb\">{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/705 | title=Arthur, prince of Wales (1486\u20131502) | publisher=Oxford University Press | work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | year=2004 | accessdate=7 October 2013 | author=Horrox, Rosemary | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/705 }} {{subscription}}</ref> on the night of 19/20 September 1486 at about 1 am,{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=1}} Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth's eldest child.{{sfn|Weir|2008a|p=151}}  Arthur's birth was anticipated by French and Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] eager for the start of a \"Virgilian golden age\".{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=1}} Sir [[Francis Bacon]] wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature, he was \"strong and able\".{{sfn|Fuller|1840|p=6}} Young Arthur was viewed as \"a living symbol\" of not only the union between the House of Tudor and the [[House of York]], to which his mother belonged as the daughter of [[Edward IV]], but also of the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|Wagner|Schmid|2011|p=1104}} In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=1}}\n\nArthur became [[Duke of Cornwall]] at birth.{{sfn|Weir|2008a|p=151}} Four days after his birth, he was baptised at [[Winchester Cathedral]] by the [[Bishop of Worcester]], [[John Alcock (bishop)|John Alcock]], which was immediately followed by his [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmation]].{{sfn|Wheeler|Kindrick|Salda|2000|p=377}} [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]], [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], [[William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel]], Queen [[Elizabeth Woodville]] and [[Cecily of York]] served as godparents; the latter two, his grandmother and aunt, respectively, carried the prince during the ceremony.{{sfn|Grose|1784|pp=193\u201397}} Initially, Arthur's nursery in [[Farnham]] was headed by Elizabeth Darcy, who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV's children, including Arthur's own mother.

From 1491, Arthur was named on [[Peace Commission|peace commissions]]. In October 1492, when his father travelled to France, he was named [[Regency|Keeper of England]] and King's Lieutenant. Following the example of Edward IV, Henry VII set up the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]] for Arthur in [[Wales]], in order to enforce royal authority there. Although the council had already been set up in 1490, it was headed by [[Jasper Tudor|Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford]].<ref name=\"odnb\" /> Arthur was first dispatched to Wales in 1501, at the age of fifteen.{{sfn|Scarisbrick|1968|p=6}} In March 1493, Arthur was granted the power to appoint justices of [[oyer and terminer]] and inquire into [[wikt:franchise#Noun|franchises]], thus strengthening the council's authority. In November of that year, the Prince also received an extensive land grant in Wales, including the [[Earl of March|County of March]].<ref name=\"odnb\" />\n\nArthur was served by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as [[Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare]], who had been brought to the English court as a consequence of the involvement of his father, [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], in the crowning of pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] in Ireland during Henry VII's reign.{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=16}} Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of [[Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke]], [[Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex|Robert Radcliffe]], the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Lady Margaret Beaufort]].

She was undressed, veiled and \"reverently\" laid in bed, while Arthur, \"in his shirt, with a gown cast about him\", was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber, while [[viol]]s and [[tabor (instrument)|tabors]] played.

His successors were Henry's daughters by Catherine and Anne, Mary I and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, the House of Tudor came to an end.\n\nIn 2002, following the initiative of [[canon (priest)|canon]] Ian MacKenzie, Arthur's funeral was reenacted with a requiem mass at Worcester Cathedral, on occasion of the [[Anniversary|quincentenary]] of his death.

As the eldest son and [[heir apparent]] of [[Henry VII of England]], Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established [[House of Tudor]]. His mother, [[Elizabeth of York]], was the daughter of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the [[House of York]].\n\nPlans for Arthur's marriage began before his third birthday; he was installed as Prince of Wales two years later. At the age of eleven, he was formally betrothed to [[Catherine of Aragon]], a daughter of the powerful [[Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain, in an effort to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. Arthur was well educated and, contrary to some modern belief, was in good health for the majority of his life. Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501, the couple took up residence at [[Ludlow Castle]] in [[Shropshire]], where Arthur died six months later of an unknown ailment. Catherine later firmly stated that the marriage had not been [[consummated]].\n\nOne year after Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's younger brother [[Henry VIII of England|Henry]], who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's untimely death paved the way for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The question as to the potential consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the [[Church of England]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\n== Infancy ==\n[[File:Family-of-Henry-VII.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The family of Henry VII, depicted on an illuminated page.]]\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] became [[King of England]] upon defeating [[Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485. In an effort to strengthen the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] claim to the throne, Henry had royal genealogists trace his lineage back to the ancient British rulers and decided on naming his firstborn son after the legendary [[King Arthur]]. On this occasion, [[Camelot]] was identified as present-day [[Winchester]],{{sfn|Wagner|Schmid|2011|p=1104}} and his wife, [[Elizabeth of York]], was sent to Saint Swithun's Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) in order to give birth there.{{sfn|Wheeler|Kindrick|Salda|2000|p=377}} Born at [[Winchester Cathedral Priory|Saint Swithun's Priory]]<ref name=\"odnb\">{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/705 | title=Arthur, prince of Wales (1486\u20131502) | publisher=Oxford University Press | work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | year=2004 | accessdate=7 October 2013 | author=Horrox, Rosemary | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/705 }} {{subscription}}</ref> on the night of 19/20 September 1486 at about 1 am,{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=1}} Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth's eldest child.{{sfn|Weir|2008a|p=151}}  Arthur's birth was anticipated by French and Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] eager for the start of a \"Virgilian golden age\".{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=1}} Sir [[Francis Bacon]] wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature, he was \"strong and able\".{{sfn|Fuller|1840|p=6}} Young Arthur was viewed as \"a living symbol\" of not only the union between the House of Tudor and the [[House of York]], to which his mother belonged as the daughter of [[Edward IV]], but also of the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|Wagner|Schmid|2011|p=1104}} In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=1}}\n\nArthur became [[Duke of Cornwall]] at birth.{{sfn|Weir|2008a|p=151}} Four days after his birth, he was baptised at [[Winchester Cathedral]] by the [[Bishop of Worcester]], [[John Alcock (bishop)|John Alcock]], which was immediately followed by his [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmation]].{{sfn|Wheeler|Kindrick|Salda|2000|p=377}} [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]], [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], [[William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel]], Queen [[Elizabeth Woodville]] and [[Cecily of York]] served as godparents; the latter two, his grandmother and aunt, respectively, carried the prince during the ceremony.{{sfn|Grose|1784|pp=193\u201397}} Initially, Arthur's nursery in [[Farnham]] was headed by Elizabeth Darcy, who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV's children, including Arthur's own mother.

From 1491, Arthur was named on [[Peace Commission|peace commissions]]. In October 1492, when his father travelled to France, he was named [[Regency|Keeper of England]] and King's Lieutenant. Following the example of Edward IV, Henry VII set up the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]] for Arthur in [[Wales]], in order to enforce royal authority there. Although the council had already been set up in 1490, it was headed by [[Jasper Tudor|Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford]].<ref name=\"odnb\" /> Arthur was first dispatched to Wales in 1501, at the age of fifteen.{{sfn|Scarisbrick|1968|p=6}} In March 1493, Arthur was granted the power to appoint justices of [[oyer and terminer]] and inquire into [[wiktionary:franchise#Noun|franchises]], thus strengthening the council's authority. In November of that year, the Prince also received an extensive land grant in Wales, including the [[Earl of March|County of March]].<ref name=\"odnb\" />\n\nArthur was served by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as [[Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare]], who had been brought to the English court as a consequence of the involvement of his father, [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], in the crowning of pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] in Ireland during Henry VII's reign.{{sfn|Gunn|Monckton|2009|p=16}} Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of [[Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke]], [[Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex|Robert Radcliffe]], the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Lady Margaret Beaufort]].

The ceremony was conducted by [[Henry Deane (archbishop of Canterbury)|Henry Deane]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who was assisted by [[William Warham]], [[Bishop of London]]. Following the ceremony, Arthur and Catherine left the Cathedral and headed for [[Baynard's Castle]], where they were entertained by \"the best voiced children of the King's chapel, who sang right sweetly with quaint harmony\".{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=33}}\n\nWhat followed was a [[bedding ceremony]] laid down by Arthur's grandmother [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Lady Margaret Beaufort]]: the bed was sprinkled with holy water, after which Catherine was led away from the wedding feast by her ladies-in-waiting. She was undressed, veiled and \"reverently\" laid in bed, while Arthur, \"in his shirt, with a gown cast about him\", was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber, while [[viol]]s and [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]]s played.

Significant towns immediately outside the boundary of the national park include [[Millom]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Kendal]], [[Ulverston]], Dalton-in-Furness, [[Cockermouth]], [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], and [[Grange-over-Sands]]; each of these has important economic links with the area. Villages such as [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], [[Threlkeld]], [[Glenridding]], [[Pooley Bridge]], [[Broughton-in-Furness]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[Newby Bridge]], [[Staveley, Cumbria|Staveley]], [[Lindale, Cumbria|Lindale]], [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]] and [[Hawkshead]] are more local centres. The economies of almost all are intimately linked with tourism.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Beyond these are a scattering of hamlets and many isolated farmsteads, some of which are still tied to agriculture;{{cn|date=October 2019}} others now function as part of the tourist economy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale Landranger map sheets 89, 90, 96 & 97</ref>\n\n=== Communications ===\n\n==== Roads ====\n[[File:A591 road, Lake District - June 2009 Edit 1.jpg|thumb|The A591 road as it passes through the countryside between Ambleside and Grasmere]]\nThe Lake District is very nearly contained within a box of [[trunk road|trunk routes]] and major A roads. It is flanked to the east by the [[A6 road (England)|A6 road]] which runs from Kendal to Penrith (though the National Park extension approved in 2015 is east of the A6). The [[A590 road|A590]] which connects the M6 to [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the [[A5092 road|A5092]] trunk roads cut across its southern fringes and the [[A66 road|A66]] trunk road between Penrith and [[Workington]] cuts across its northern edge. Finally the [[A595 road|A595]] (linking the A66 with the A5092) forms the park boundary from Calder Bridge to Holmrook, then crosses the coastal plain of the park until turning inland at the Whicham Valley.\n\nBesides these, a few [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A roads]] penetrate the area itself, notably the [[A591]] which runs north-westwards from Kendal to Windermere and then on to Keswick. It continues up the east side of [[Bassenthwaite Lake]]. \"The A591, Grasmere, Lake District\" was short-listed in the 2011 [[Google Street View]] awards in the Most Romantic Street category. The [[A593 road|A593]] and [[A5084 road (Great Britain)#Four-digit roads (50xx)|A5084]] link the Ambleside and Coniston areas with the A590 to the south whilst the [[A592 road|A592]] and [[A5074 road|A5074]] similarly link Windermere with the A590. The A592 also continues northwards from Windermere to [[Ullswater]] and Penrith by way of the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\nSome valleys which are not penetrated by A roads are served by [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B roads]]. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and [[Buttermere, Cumbria|Buttermere]] and links via the [[Honister Pass]] with [[Borrowdale]]. The [[B5292 road|B5292]] ascends the [[Whinlatter Pass]] from Lorton Vale before dropping down to [[Braithwaite]] near Keswick. The [[B5322 road|B5322]] serves the valley of [[St John's in the Vale]] whilst [[Great Langdale]] is served by the [[B5343 road|B5343]]. Other valleys such as [[Little Langdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] and [[Duddon Valley|Dunnerdale]] are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] and [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] passes respectively; both of these passes are known for their steep gradients and are together one of the most popular [[Climbing specialist|climbs]] in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Britain's top 10 toughest cycle climbs |last=Warren |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/20/britains-top-10-toughest-cycle-climbs |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> A minor road through the [[Newlands Valley]] connects via [[Newlands Hause]] with the B5289 at Buttermere.

For instance, Seatoller to Wasdale head is about 6 miles on foot, but 49 miles by road.}}, as are [[Longsleddale]] and the valleys at [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] and [[Kentmere]]. There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere and Coniston.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==== Railways and ferries ====\nThe [[West Coast Main Line]] skirts the eastern edge of the Lake District and the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] passes through the southern and western fringes of the area. A single railway line, the [[Windermere Branch Line]], penetrates from Kendal to Windermere via Staveley. Railways once served Broughton-in-Furness and Coniston (closed to passengers in 1958) and another ran from Penrith to Cockermouth via Keswick (closed west of Keswick in 1966 and completely in 1972). Part of the track of the latter is used by the improved A66 trunk road.\n\nThe [[Cumbrian Coast line]] has three stations within the boundaries of the national park (and additionally [[Drigg]], about a third of a mile from the park boundary). The line gives railway enthusiasts and others a flavour of a pre-[[Beeching cuts|Beeching]] railway line, with features like manually operated level crossing gates, as well as giving a good connection to the steam railway into Eskdale and providing access for cyclists and serious walkers to the Western Fells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/the-cumbrian-coast-railway/|website=Visit Cumbria|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe narrow gauge [[Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway]] runs from [[Ravenglass]] on the west coast up Eskdale as far as Dalegarth Station near the hamlet of Boot, catering for tourists. Another [[heritage railway]], the [[Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway]], runs between Lake Windermere and [[Haverthwaite]], and tourists can connect at Lakeside with the boats up the lake to Bowness.\n\nA vehicle-carrying [[cable ferry]], the [[Windermere Ferry]], runs frequent services across Windermere. There are also seasonal passenger boats on Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater.\n\n==== Footpaths and bridleways ====\nThere are many paths over which the public has a [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]], all of which should be signposted. Within the area of the National Park in 2012 there were {{convert|2159|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public footpath (England and Wales)|public footpaths]],\n{{convert|875|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public bridleway (England and Wales)|public bridleways]],\n{{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} of [[restricted byway]]s and\n{{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of [[Byway open to all traffic|byways open to all traffic]].

However the apparent radial pattern is not from a central dome, but from an axial watershed extending west-east from St Bees Head to Shap. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin, and often contain elongate lakes occupying sizeable [[bedrock]] hollows, with tracts of relatively flat ground at their infilled heads, or where they are divided by lateral tributaries (Buttermere-Crummock Water; Derwent Water-Bassenthwaite Lake). Smaller lakes known as [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] occupy [[cirque (landform)|glacial cirques]] at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District. The mountains of the Lake District are also known as the \"Cumbrian Mountains\", although this name is less frequently used than terms like \"the Lake District\" or \"the Lakeland Fells\". As the highest ground in England, [[Scafell Pike]] (978m/3210') naturally has a very extensive view on a clear day, ranging from the Galloway Hills of Scotland to the [[Mourne Mountains]] in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and [[Snowdonia]] in Wales.\n{{wide image|Annotated Scafel Pike Panorama.jpg|3000px|A panorama from the summit of Scafell Pike, August 2007}}\n\nMany of the higher [[fell]]s are rocky, while [[moorland]] predominates at lower altitudes. Vegetation cover across better drained areas includes [[bracken]] and [[Calluna|heather]], though much of the land is [[bog]]gy, due to the high rainfall. Deciduous native woodland occurs on many of the  steeper slopes below the [[tree line]], but with native oak supplemented by extensive conifer plantations in many areas, particularly [[Grizedale Forest]] in the generally lower southern part of the area.  The Lake District extends to the sea to the west and south.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/maps/sharing|title=Maps|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Wasdale screes.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the Wasdale screes descending into [[Wastwater]], the deepest lake in England.}}\n\n=== Valleys ===\n[[File:The Tongue Valley (looking from Dollywaggon Pike), near Troutbeck, Cumbria, at the Lake District National Park, United Kingdom, Europe (November 2008).jpg|thumb|The Tongue Valley (looking from ''Dollywaggon Pike'')]]\nThe principal radial valleys are (clockwise from the south) [[Dunnerdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]], [[Wasdale]], [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]], the Vale of Lorton and [[Buttermere]] valley, the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|Derwent Valley]] and [[Borrowdale]], the Ullswater valley, Haweswater valley, [[Longsleddale]], the [[Kentmere]] valley, those converging on the head of Windermere - Grasmere, [[Great Langdale]] and Little Langdale, and the Coniston Water valley. The valleys break the mountains up into separate blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered approach is that made popular by [[Alfred Wainwright]] who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.\n\n=== Woodlands ===\nBelow the [[tree line]] are wooded areas, including British and European native [[oak]] woodlands and introduced softwood plantations. The woodlands provide habitats for native English wildlife. The native [[red squirrel]] is found in the Lake District and in a few other parts of England. In parts of the Lake District the rainfall is higher than in any other part of England. This gives [[Atlantic]] [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[lichen]], and [[liverwort]]s the chance to grow. There is some [[ancient woodland]] in the National Park. Management of the woodlands varies: some are [[coppice]]d, some [[pollarding|pollarded]], some left to grow naturally, and some provide grazing and shelter.\n\n=== Fells (hills) ===\n[[File:Scafell massif.jpg|thumb|The impressive bulk of the [[Scafell]] massif, the highest ground in England, seen over [[Wasdale]].]]\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Some major fells and towns'''}}|places=\n<!-- Fells -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell Pike]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=16|position=right\n|lat=54.454222|long=-3.211528}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Helvellyn]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.527|long=-3.016}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Skiddaw]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=right\n|lat=54.647|long=-3.146}}\n<!-- High Raise gets in the way and isn't very high\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|Raise]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|High]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}-->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.492|long=-2.865}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmoor]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.571|long=-3.279}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Old Man]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.37|long=-3.119}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Great Gable]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.482|long=-3.219}}\n<!-- Places -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Kendal}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.326|long=-2.745}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Penrith}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.6648|long=-2.7548}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Keswick}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.59|long=-3.14}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Ambleside}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.4251|long=-2.9626}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Cockermouth}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=left|lat=54.6613|long=-3.362}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Windermere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.376|long=-2.907}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Grasmere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=top|lat=54.45809|long=-3.02459}}\n}}\n{{See also|list of fells in the Lake District|list of hills in the Lake District}}\nThe four highest mountains in the Lake District exceed {{convert|3000|ft|m|0}}. These are:\n* [[Scafell Pike]], {{convert|978|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* [[Scafell]], {{convert|965|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* [[Helvellyn]], {{convert|951|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* [[Skiddaw]], {{convert|931|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\n==== Northern Fells ====\nThe [[Northern Fells]] are a clearly defined range of hills contained within a {{convert|13|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} diameter circle between [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the south west and [[Caldbeck]] in the north east. They culminate in the {{convert|931|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak of [[Skiddaw]]. Other notable peaks are [[Blencathra]] (also known as Saddleback) ({{convert|868|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Carrock Fell]]. [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] occupies the valley between this massif and the North Western Fells.\n\n==== North Western Fells ====\nThe [[North Western Fells]] lie between [[Borrowdale]] and Bassenthwaite Lake to the east and [[Buttermere]] and [[Lorton Vale]] to the west. Their southernmost point is at [[Honister Pass]]. This area includes the Derwent Fells above the [[Newlands Valley]] and hills to the north amongst which are [[Dale Head]], [[Robinson (Lake District)|Robinson]]. To the north stand [[Grasmoor]], highest in the range at {{convert|852|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Grisedale Pike]] and the hills around the valley of [[Coledale (Cumbria)|Coledale]], and in the far north west is Thornthwaite Forest and [[Lord's Seat]]. The fells in this area are rounded [[Skiddaw slate]], with few tarns and relatively few rock faces.\n\n==== Western Fells ====\n[[File:Westmorland cairn Great Gable.jpg|thumb|The view towards [[Wast Water]] from the cairn built by the Westmorland brothers in 1876 to the SW of the summit of [[Great Gable]], which they considered the finest view in the district.]]\nThe [[Western Fells]] lie between Buttermere and [[Wasdale]], with [[Sty Head]] forming the apex of a large triangle. [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] bisects the area, which consists of the [[High Stile]] ridge north of Ennerdale, the [[Loweswater Fells]] in the far north west, the [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]] group in the south west, and [[Great Gable]] ({{convert|2949|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}) near Sty Head. Other tops include [[Seatallan]], [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and [[Kirk Fell]]. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. [[Wastwater]], located in this part, is England's deepest lake.\n\n==== Central Fells ====\nThe [[Central Fells]] are lower in elevation than surrounding areas of fell, peaking at {{convert|762|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[High Raise, Langdale|High Raise]]. They take the form of a ridge running between [[Derwent Water]] in the west and [[Thirlmere]] in the east, from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the north to [[Langdale Pikes]] in the south. A spur extends south east to [[Loughrigg Fell]] above [[Ambleside]]. The central ridge running north over [[High Seat, Lake District|High Seat]] is exceptionally boggy.\n\n==== Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Glenridding, Cumbria, England - June 2009.jpg|thumb|The village of [[Glenridding]] and [[Ullswater]] lake]]\nThe [[Eastern Fells]] consist of a long north-to-south [[ridge]], the [[Helvellyn range]], running from [[Clough Head]] to [[Seat Sandal]] with the {{convert|3118|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Helvellyn]] at its highest point. The western slopes of these summits tend to be grassy, with rocky [[Cirque|corries]] and [[cliff|crags]] on the eastern side. The [[Fairfield (Lake District)|Fairfield]] group lies to the south of the range, and forms a similar pattern with towering rock faces and hidden valleys spilling into the [[Patterdale]] valley. It culminates in the height of [[Red Screes]] overlooking the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\n==== Far Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Haweswater from Harter Fell 3.jpg|thumb|[[Haweswater Reservoir]] from [[Harter Fell (Mardale)|Harter Fell]]]]\nThe [[Far Eastern Fells]] refer to all of the Lakeland fells to the east of Ullswater and the A592 road running south to Windermere. At {{convert|828|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the peak known as [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]] is the highest point on a complex ridge which runs broadly north\u2013south and overlooks the hidden valley of [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] to its east. In the north of this region are the lower fells of Martindale Common and Bampton Common whilst in the south are the fells overlooking the [[Kentmere]] valley. Further to the east, beyond [[Mardale]] and [[Longsleddale]] is [[Shap]] Fell, an extensive area consisting of high [[moorland]], more rolling and [[Pennines|Pennine]] in nature than the mountains to the west.\n\n==== Southern Fells ====\n[[File:Coniston Water from Holme Fell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coniston Water]] from [[Holme Fell]]]]\nThe [[Southern Fells]] occupy the southwestern quarter of the Lake District. They can be regarded as comprising a northern grouping between Wasdale, Eskdale and the two Langdale valleys, a southeastern group east of Dunnerdale and south of Little Langdale and a southwestern group bounded by Eskdale to the north and Dunnerdale to the east.\n\nThe first group includes England's highest mountains: [[Scafell Pike]] in the centre, at {{convert|3209|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} and [[Scafell]] {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} to the southwest. Though it is slightly lower it has a {{convert|700|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} rockface, Scafell Crag, on its northern side. It also includes the [[Wastwater Screes]] overlooking Wasdale, the [[Glaramara]] ridge overlooking Borrowdale, the three tops of [[Crinkle Crags]], [[Bowfell]] and [[Esk Pike]]. The core of the area is drained by the infant [[River Esk, Cumbria|River Esk]]. Collectively these are some of the Lake District's most rugged hillsides.\n\nThe second group, otherwise known as the [[Furness Fells]] or Coniston Fells, have as their northern boundary the steep and narrow  [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] and [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] passes. The highest are [[Old Man of Coniston]] and [[Swirl How]] which slightly exceed {{convert|800|m|-2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe third group to the west of the Duddon includes [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]] and the long ridge leading over [[Whitfell]] to [[Black Combe]] and the sea. The south of this region consists of lower forests and knolls, with [[Kirkby Moor]] on the southern boundary. The southwestern Lake District ends near the [[Furness]] peninsula and [[Barrow-in-Furness]], a town which many Lake District residents rely on for basic amenities.\n\n==== Southeastern area ====\nThe southeastern area is the territory between [[Coniston Water]] and [[Windermere]] and east of Windermere towards Kendal and south to Lindale. There are no high summits in this area which is mainly low hills, knolls and limestone [[cuesta]]s such as [[Gummer's How]] and [[Whitbarrow]]. Indeed, it rises only as high as {{convert|333|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Top o' Selside]] east of Coniston Water; the wide expanse of [[Grizedale Forest]] stands between the two lakes. [[Kendal]] and [[Morecambe Bay]] stand at the eastern and southern edges of the area.\n\n=== Lakes ===\n{{Wide image|Derwent Water, Keswick - June 2009.jpg|1200px|Derwent Water, one of 21 large water bodies in the Lake District}}\n{{See also|List of lakes in the Lake District}}\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Major lakes'''}}|places=\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Bassenthwaite Lake|Bassenthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.65|long=-3.216667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Brothers Water|Brotherswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=bottom|lat=54.505556|long=-2.925}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Buttermere|Butter-<br />mere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.266667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Water|Coniston]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.335|long=-3.08}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Crummock Water|Crummock]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.56|long=-3.308}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Derwent Water|Derwent<br />Water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.574|long=-3.145}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Elter Water|Elterwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.427469|long=-3.025875}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.52|long=-3.376111}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Esthwaite Water|Esthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.359|long=-2.99}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmere (lake)|Grasmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.448834|long=-3.020897}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Haweswater Reservoir|Hawes-<br />water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.518889|long=-2.804722}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Loweswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.5825|long=-3.355278}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Rydal Water]]'''|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.446944|long=-2.996389}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Thirlmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.066667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ullswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.5775|long=-2.8751}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Wastwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.441667|long=-3.291667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Windermere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.390|long=-2.944}}\n}}\nOnly one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, [[Bassenthwaite Lake]].

The intertidal zone of the combined estuaries includes sand, shingle and mudflats and [[saltmarsh]]. The dune systems on either side of the estuary are protected as nature reserves; Drigg Dunes and Gullery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cwr.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?Site=6167|title=Defra, UK - Rural Affairs|website=cwr.defra.gov.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the north and Eskmeals Dunes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/eskmeals-dunes|title=Eskmeals Dunes &#124; Cumbria Wildlife Trust|website=www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the south. South of the estuary the coast is formed in low cliffs of glacial [[till]], sands and gravels.<ref>http://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex/home.html  BGS Geoindex Onshore</ref>\n\nThe district also extends to the tidal waters of [[Morecambe Bay]] and several of its estuaries alongside the [[Furness Peninsula|Furness]] and [[Cartmel Peninsula]]s, designated on M6 motorway signposts as the \"Lake District Peninsulas\", and the southern portions of which lie outside the park. These are the [[Duddon Estuary]], the [[River Leven, Cumbria|Leven Estuary]], and the western banks and tidal flats of the [[River_Kent#Lower_river|Kent Estuary]]. These areas are each characterised by sand and mudflats of scenic and wildlife interest. The coast is backed by extensive flats of raised marine deposits left when relative sea level was higher.\n\n== Geology ==\n{{main|Geology of the Lake District}}\n[[File:Lake District Geology Map.svg|thumb|Geological map of the Lake District showing the main structures and areas of mineralisation]]\n[[File:Skiddaw (cropped).JPG|thumb|Skiddaw seen from Derwentwater]]\nThe Lake District's geology is very complex but well-studied.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\">Gannon, ''Rock Trails Lakeland''</ref> A [[granite]] [[batholith]] beneath the area is responsible for this upland massif, its relatively low density causing the area to be \"buoyed up\". The granite can be seen at the surface as the Ennerdale, Skiddaw, Carrock Fell, Eskdale and Shap granites.\n\nBroadly speaking the area can be divided into three bands, the divisions between which run south west to north east. Generally speaking the rocks become younger from north west to south east. The north western band is composed of early to mid-[[Ordovician]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, largely [[mudstone]]s and [[siltstone]]s of marine origin. Together they comprise the [[Skiddaw Group]] and include the rocks traditionally known as the [[Skiddaw Slate]]s. Their [[friability]] generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.\n\nThe central band is a mix of [[volcanic]] and sedimentary rocks of mid-to-late Ordovician age comprising the [[lava]]s and [[tuff]]s of the [[Borrowdale Volcanic Group]], erupted as the former [[Iapetus Ocean]] was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath what is now the Scottish border during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. The northern central peaks, such as Great Rigg, were produced by considerable lava flows. These lava eruptions were followed by a series of [[Pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] eruptions which produced a series of calderas, one of which includes present-day Scafell Pike. These pyroclastic rocks give rise to the craggy landscapes typical of the central fells.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\"/>\n\nThe south eastern band comprises the mudstones and [[wacke]]s of the [[Windermere Supergroup]] and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston and Kendal groups. These are generally a little less resistant to erosion than the rocks sequence to the north and underlie much of the lower landscapes around Coniston and Windermere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nLater [[intrusion]]s have formed individual outcrops of [[igneous rock]] in each of these groups.\nAround the edges of these Ordovician and Silurian rocks on the northern, eastern and southern fringes of the area is a semi-continuous outcrop of [[Carboniferous Limestone]] seen most spectacularly at places like [[Whitbarrow Scar]] and [[Scout Scar]].\n<ref>British Geological Survey Regional memoir ''Northern England'' 5th edn 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/171188/factsheet_geology.pdf|title=Geology Factsheet|publisher=Lake District National Park Authority Web|date=May 24, 2017|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe Lake District's location on the northwest coast of England, coupled with its mountainous geography, makes it the wettest part of England. The UK [[Met Office]] reports average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}}, but with very large local variation.\n\nAlthough the entire region receives above average rainfall, there is a wide disparity between the amount of rainfall in the western and eastern lakes, as the Lake District experiences [[relief rainfall]]. [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite, Borrowdale]] is the wettest inhabited place in England with an average of {{convert|3300|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} of rain a year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|title=UK regional climates|work=Met Office|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003213/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|archivedate=5 June 2011}}</ref> while nearby [[Sprinkling Tarn]] is even wetter, recording over {{convert|5000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} per year<ref>{{cite web |last1=Visit Cumbria |title=Lake District weather |url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/lake-district-weather/ |website=visitcumbria.com |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lake District Weatherline |title=Overview of weather |url=https://www.lakedistrictweatherline.co.uk/ |website=Lake District Weatherline |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref>; by contrast, Keswick, at the end of [[Borrowdale]] receives {{convert|1470|mm|in|abbr=on}} every year, and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] (just outside the Lake District) only {{convert|870|mm|in|abbr=on}}. March to June tend to be the driest months, with October to January the wettest, but at low levels there is relatively little difference between months.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAlthough sheltered valleys experience [[gale]]s on an average of only five days a year, the Lake District is generally very windy with the coastal areas having 20 days of gales, and the fell tops around 100 days of gales per year. The maritime climate means that the Lake District experiences relatively moderate temperature variations through the year. Mean temperature in the valleys ranges from about {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in January to around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in July. (By comparison, [[Moscow]], at the same latitude, ranges from {{convert|-10|to|19|C|F|abbr=on}}.)\n\nThe relatively low height of most of the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on [[Helvellyn]] 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.\n{{Weather box <!-- Infobox begins -->\n|collapsed=    <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

In 2002, the [[Environment Agency]] introduced a new fisheries byelaw, banning the use of all freshwater fish as live or dead bait in 14 of the lakes in the Lake District. Anglers not complying with the new byelaw can face fines of up to \u00a32,500. There are 14 lakes in the Lake District which are affected. These are: Bassenthwaite Lake, Brothers Water, Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Derwent Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Red Tarn, Thirlmere, Ullswater, Wast Water and Windermere.\n\nThe lakes and waters of the Lake District do not naturally support as many species of fish as other similar habitats in the south of the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some fish that do thrive there are particularly at risk from introduction of new species.\n\nThe introduction of non-native fish can lead to the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with [[ruffe]]. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example [[Rutilus|roach]], are only at risk for as little as three days.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Agriculture and forestry ===\n[[File:Forestry on Harter Fell.jpg|thumb|Forestry operations on [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]]]]\n\nFarming, and in particular [[Domestic sheep|sheep farming]], has been the major industry in the region since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. The breed most closely associated with the area is the tough [[Herdwick]], with [[Rough Fell]] and [[Swaledale (sheep)|Swaledale]] sheep also common. Sheep farming remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see. Features such as [[dry stone wall]]s, for example, are there as a result of sheep farming. Some land is also used for [[silage]] and [[dairy farming]].\n\nThe area was badly affected by the outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in [[Surrey]] in February, but had spread to [[Cumbria]] by end of March.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lake District 'nightmare' as fell farm is infected |last=Cadwalladr |first=Carole |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1327961/Lake-District-nightmare-as-fell-farm-is-infected.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Thousands of sheep, including the native [[Herdwick]]s which graze on the fellsides across the district, were destroyed. In replacing the sheep, one problem to overcome was that many of the lost sheep were ''heafed'', that is, they knew their part of the unfenced fell and did not stray, with this knowledge being passed between generations. With all the sheep lost at once, this knowledge has to be relearnt and some of the fells have had discreet [[electric fence]]s strung across them for a period of five years, to allow the sheep to \"re-heaf\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=If they go, it is the end of Lakeland |last=Griffin |first=Harry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/11/footandmouth.features11 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> At the time of the outbreak, worries existed about the future of certain species of sheep such as [[Ryeland]] and Herdwick in the district,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rare breeds 'could be lost' |last=MacClean |first=Matt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1233458.stm |work=BBC News |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> however these fears have been allayed and sheep now occupy the district in abundance.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sheep breed resurrected decade on from foot and mouth |last=Clarke |first=Tom |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sheep-breed-resurrected-decade-on-from-foot-and-mouth |work=Channel 4 News |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Thirleme 069.jpg|thumb|A young [[Herdwick]] grazing above [[Thirlmere]]. Older sheep of this breed are grey or white.]]\n\nForestry has also assumed greater importance over the course of the last century with the establishment of extensive conifer plantations around [[Whinlatter Pass]], in [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] and at [[Grizedale Forest]] amongst other places. There are extensive plantations of non-native pine trees.\n\n=== Industry ===\nWith its wealth of rock types and their abundance in the landscape, mining and quarrying have long been significant activities in the Lake District economy. In [[Neolithic]] times, the Lake District was a major source of stone [[axe]]s, examples of which have been found all over Britain. The primary site, on the slopes of the Langdale Pikes, is sometimes described as a \"stone axe factory\" of the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Some of the earliest [[stone circle]]s in Britain are connected with this industry.\n\nMining, particularly of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), [[baryte]], [[graphite]] and [[slate]], was historically a major Lakeland industry, mainly from the 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide [[charcoal]] for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the [[Honister Slate Mine|Honister Mines]], at the top of [[Honister Pass]]. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite led to the development of the [[pencil]] industry, especially around [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]].\n\n[[File:Lake District near Torver.jpg|thumb|A typical Lake District scene]]\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, half the world textile industry's [[bobbin]] supply came from the Lake District area. Over the past century, however, tourism has grown rapidly to become the area's primary source of income.\n\n=== Development of tourism ===\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2011}}\nEarly visitors to the Lake District, who travelled for the education and pleasure of the journey, include [[Celia Fiennes]] who in 1698 undertook a journey the length of England, including riding through [[Kendal]] and over [[Kirkstone Pass]] into [[Patterdale]]. Her experiences and impressions were published in her book ''Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall'':\n\n<blockquote>As I walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren hills which hang over one\u2019s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents of water from the sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=81JxDbc2KeIC&pg=PA183&dq=descends+into+the+bottoms+which+are+a+Moorish+ground&hl=en&ei=phdrTvmvHI_sOdbgrdcF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=descends%20into%20the%20bottoms%20which%20are%20a%20Moorish%20ground&f=false An Anthology of Women's Travel Writing \u2013 Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] published the first volume of ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain''. He commented on [[Westmorland]] that it was:\n\n<blockquote>the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even Wales itself; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which, in the language of the country, are called fells.</blockquote>\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the area was becoming more popular with travellers. This was partly a result of wars in [[Continental Europe]], restricting the possibility of travel there. In 1778 [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]] produced ''A Guide to the Lakes'', which began the era of modern tourism.\n\n[[File:Claife Station.jpg|thumb|Claife Station on the western shore of [[Windermere]]]]\nWest listed \"stations\", viewpoints where tourists could enjoy the best views of the landscape, being encouraged to appreciate the formal qualities of the landscape and to apply aesthetic values. At some of these stations, buildings were erected to help this process. The remains of Claife Station (on the western shore [[Windermere]] below [[Claife Heights]]) can be visited today.\n\n[[William Wordsworth]] published his ''Guide to the Lakes'' in 1810, and by 1835 it had reached its fifth edition, now called ''A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England''. This book was particularly influential in popularising the region. Wordsworth's favourite valley was Dunnerdale or the [[Duddon Valley]] nestling in the south west of the Lake District.\n\nThe railways led to another expansion in tourism. The [[Kendal and Windermere Railway]] was the first to penetrate the Lake District, reaching [[Kendal]] in 1846 and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] in 1847. The line to [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network with ferries between [[Fleetwood]] and [[Barrow-in-Furness]]); the line from [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] through [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] to [[Cockermouth]] in 1865; and the line to [[Lakeside, Cumbria|Lakeside]] at the foot of [[Windermere]] in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge increase in the number of visitors, thus contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of [[Ullswater]], Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], and [[Derwent Water]].\n\n[[File:STEAMER ON ULLSWATER.jpg|thumb|A steamer on [[Ullswater]]]]\n\nThe growth in tourist numbers continued into the age of the motor car, when railways began to be closed or run down. The formation of the [[Lake District National Park]] in 1951 recognised the need to protect the Lake District environment from excessive commercial or industrial exploitation, preserving that which visitors come to see, without any restriction on the movement of people into and around the district. The [[M6 Motorway]] helped bring traffic to the Lake District, passing up its eastern flank. The narrow roads present a challenge for traffic flow and, from the 1960s, certain areas have been very congested.\n\nWhilst the roads and railways provided easier access to the area, many people were drawn to Lakeland by the publication of the ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' by [[Alfred Wainwright]]. First published between 1955 and 1966, these books provided detailed information on 214 fells across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of [[Peak bagging|bagging]] the complete list of ''[[List of Wainwrights|Wainwrights]]''. The famous guides were revised by [[Chris Jesty]] between 2005 and 2009 to reflect changes, mainly in valley access and paths, and are currently being revised by Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion. The first of the revised volumes, Book One: The Eastern Fells, was published in March 2015; the most recent, Book Six: The North Western Fells, was published in April 2019.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/13/books.ruralaffairs | work=The Guardian | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | title=Famed fells guides join the 21st century | date=13 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nSince the early 1960s, the National Park Authority has employed rangers to help cope with increasing tourism and development, the first being [[John Wyatt (writer)|John Wyatt]], who has since written a number of guide books. He was joined two years later by a second, and since then the number of rangers has been rising.\n\nThe area has also become associated with writer [[Beatrix Potter]]. A number of tourists visit to see her family home, with particularly large numbers coming from Japan.\n\nTourism has now become the park's major industry, with about 12&nbsp;million visitors each year, mainly from the UK's larger settlements, China, Japan, Spain, Germany and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel |title=Desintations: Lake District |publisher=BBC\\ |date=27 January 2005 |archivedate=27 January 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127144348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel/ }}</ref> Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria's most popular charging tourist attraction with about 1.35&nbsp;million paying customers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. [[Soil erosion]], caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two [[Visitor center|tourist information centres]] in the National Park were closed.\n\nCycling is now popular in the Lake District National Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/cycling|title=Lake District cycling|date=2017-04-25|website=Lake District National Park|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> A number of long-distance cycle routes go through the Lake District, including coast to coast cycle routes such as the [[Coast to Coast Cycle Route|C2C]], Hadrian\u2019s Cycleway, the Reivers Route and the Walney to Wear route. Several towns have also become hubs for road-cycling holidays and cycle touring, such as [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] and [[Ambleside]]. Mountain bikers use the trails constructed at Whinlatter Forest<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestryengland.uk/whinlatter/cycling-and-mountain-biking-trails-whinlatter|title=Cycling and mountain biking trails at Whinlatter|website=Forestry England|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> and Grizedale Forest and also have wilder routes available on bridleways. \n\nCultural tourism is becoming an increasingly important part of the wider tourist industry. The Lake District's links with a wealth of artists and writers and its strong history of providing summer theatre performances in the old Blue Box of Century Theatre are strong attractions for visiting tourists. The tradition of theatre is carried on by venues such as [[Theatre by the Lake]] in Keswick with its summer season of six plays in [[repertoire (theatre)|repertoire]], Christmas and Easter productions, and the many literature, film, mountaineering, jazz and creative arts festivals, such as the [[Kendal Mountain Festival]] and the [[Keswick Mountain Festival]].\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nExcellent mutton and lamb has been produced locally for generations and traditionally formed the basis of the region's many rustic dishes, such as Tatie Pot, a potato-topped mutton casserole. The Traditional [[Cumberland sausage|Cumberland Sausage]] is a spiced, unlinked pork sausage with [[Protected Geographical Status]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Traditional Cumberland Sausage |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271308/pfn-cumberland-sausage-pgi.pdf |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> The Lake District now has a growing reputation for its fine dining <ref>{{cite news|author1=Harry Wallop|title=Michelin Guide 2010: UK has more starred restaurants than ever before|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/6998093/Michelin-Guide-2010-UK-has-more-starred-restaurants-than-ever-before.html|quote=the Lake District is becoming one of the best places to eat in Britain|accessdate=8 January 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=15 January 2010}}</ref> although standard pub and cafe fare continues to dominate.

[[Thomas Gray]] was the first to bring the region to attention, when he wrote a journal of his [[Grand Tour]] in 1769, but it was [[William Wordsworth]] whose poems were most famous and influential. Wordsworth's poem \"[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud]]\", inspired by the sight of [[daffodils]] on the shores of Ullswater, remains one of the most famous in the English language. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at [[Hawkshead]], and afterwards living in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] (1799\u20131813) and [[Rydal Mount]] (1813\u201350). Wordsworth, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey|Southey]] became known as the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nThe poet and his wife lie buried in the churchyard of Grasmere and very near to them are the remains of [[Hartley Coleridge]] (son of the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), who himself lived for many years in Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere. [[Robert Southey]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] and friend of Wordsworth (who would succeed Southey as Laureate in 1843), was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803\u201343), and was buried in [[St Kentigern's Church, Crosthwaite|Crosthwaite churchyard]]. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived for some time in Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at Grasmere. From 1807 to 1815 [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] lived at Windermere. [[Thomas de Quincey]] spent the greater part of the years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place of residence both of [[Thomas Arnold]], who spent there the vacations of the last ten years of his life and of [[Harriet Martineau]], who built herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick, Mrs Lynn Linton (wife of [[William James Linton]]) was born, in 1822. [[Brantwood]], a house beside Coniston Water, was the home of [[John Ruskin]] during the last years of his life. His assistant [[W. G. Collingwood]] the author, artist and antiquarian lived nearby, and wrote ''Thorstein of the Mere,'' set in the Norse period.\n\nIn addition to these residents or natives of the Lake District, a variety of other poets and writers made visits to the Lake District or were bound by ties of friendship with those already mentioned above. These include [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], [[Henry Crabb Robinson]], [[Richard Sharp (politician)|\"Conversation\" Sharp]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Keats]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Gerald Massey]].\n\nAlthough it is unlikely she ever went there, [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] produced no less than sixteen poems on subjects within the Lake District and its surroundings, all associated with engravings within Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books, from 1832 to 1838. Also included there (1834) is ''Grasmere Lake (A Sketch by a Cockney)'', a skit on becoming a 'lakes poet'.\n\nThe English composer Sir [[Arthur Somervell]] (1863 \u2013 1937) was born in Windermere.\n \nDuring the early 20th century, the children's author [[Beatrix Potter]] was in residence at [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top]] Farm, setting many of her famous [[Peter Rabbit]] books in the Lake District. Her life was made into a [[Miss Potter|biopic film]], starring [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Ewan McGregor]]. [[Arthur Ransome]] lived in several areas of the Lake District, and set five of his [[Swallows and Amazons series]] of books, published between 1930 and 1947, in a fictionalised Lake District setting. So did [[Geoffrey Trease]] with his five Black Banner school stories (1949\u201356), starting with ''[[No Boats on Bannermere]]''.\n\nThe novelist [[Hugh Walpole|Sir Hugh Walpole]] lived at \"Brackenburn\" on the lower slopes of [[Catbells]] overlooking Derwent Water from 1924 until his death in 1941. Whilst living at \"Brackenburn\" he wrote ''The Herries Chronicle'' detailing the history of a fictional Cumbrian family over two centuries. The noted author and poet [[Norman Nicholson]] came from the south west lakes, living and writing about [[Millom]] in the 20th century \u2013 he was known as the last of the [[Lake Poets]] and came close to becoming the Poet Laureate.\n\nThe Lakes has been an inspirations for many notable artists. Some of the most famous artists to depict the region in their work have been [[Alfred Heaton Cooper]] and [[William Heaton Cooper]].\n\nWriter and author [[Melvyn Bragg]] was brought up in the region and has used it as the setting for some of his work, such as his novel ''A Time to Dance'', later turned into a television drama.\n\nThe Lake District has been the setting for crime novels by [[Reginald Hill]], [[Val McDermid]] and [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]]. The region is also a recurring theme in [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s 1926 novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'' and features prominently in [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Amsterdam (novel)|Amsterdam]]'', which won the 1998 [[Booker Prize]]. The 1996 [[Eisner Award]] winning graphic novel [[The Tale of One Bad Rat]] by [[Bryan Talbot]] featured a young girl's journey to and subsequent stay in the Lake District.\n\nThe Lake District is mentioned in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''; [[Elizabeth Bennet]] looks forward to a holiday there with her aunt and uncle and is \"excessively disappointed\" upon learning they cannot travel that far.\n\nThe opening of [[Charlotte Turner Smith]]'s novel ''Ethelinde'' with its atmospheric description of [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], complete with a Gothic abbey, is supposed to have induced Wordsworth into looking to it as a possible place of residence.\n\nFilm director [[Ken Russell]] lived in the Keswick/Borrowdale area from 1975 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |title=Coombe Cottage |publisher=Thelakedistrict.info |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218052207/http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |archivedate=18 February 2009}}</ref> and used it in films such as ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' and ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]''.\n\nThe German artist [[Kurt Schwitters]] visited the Lake District while in exile in Great Britain and moved there permanently in June 1945, remaining there for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Lake District is the setting for the 1977 [[Richard Adams]] novel ''[[The Plague Dogs]]''. Adams' knowledge of the area offers the reader a precise view of the natural beauty of the Lake District. The story is based at a fictionalised version of the remote hill farm of Lawson Park, overlooking Coniston Water. The base of contemporary art commissioner and residency base [[Grizedale Arts]] since 2007, Lawson Park now hosts artists' residencies, opens to the public on occasion, and has developed a significant garden that includes art works alongside extensive plantings. Grizedale Arts has produced many internationally-significant cultural projects and has proved instrumental in the careers of several [[Turner Prize]]-winning artists, making Laure Provoust's winning installation 'Wantee' at Lawson Park, and bringing the exhibition to Coniston's [[Ruskin Museum]] in 2013. It also supported the refurbishment of the historic [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] Institute and developed an Honest Shop there (opening in 2012), an unstaffed shop stocking local crafts and produce.\n\nThe [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]] at Keswick was started by [[Canon Rawnsley]], a friend of [[John Ruskin]].\n\nAlso set in the Lake District is Sophie Jackson's mystery novel ''The Woman Died Thrice''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clara Fitzgerald Mysteries |url=http://sophiejackson1984.wixsite.com/sophiejackson/fiction |website=Sophie Jackson's website |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}</ref> It was published in 2016 under Jackson's pen name Evelyn James.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nA number of words and phrases are local to the Lake District and are part of the [[Cumbrian dialect]], though many are shared by other northern dialects. These include:\n\n*[[Fell]] \u2013 from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|fjallr}}, brought to England by [[Viking]] invaders and close to modern Norwegian {{lang|no|fjell}} and Swedish {{lang|sv|fj\u00e4ll}} meaning mountain\n*Howe \u2013 place name from the [[Old Norse]] ''haugr'' meaning hill, knoll, or mound\n*[[tarn (lake)|Tarn]] \u2013 a word that has been taken to mean a small lake situated in a [[Cirque|corrie]] (the local name for which is ''cove'' or ''comb''), a local phrase for any small pool of water. The word is derived from the [[Old Norse]], Norwegian and Swedish word ''tjern/tj\u00e4rn'', meaning small lake.\n*[[Yan tan tethera]] \u2013 the name for a system of sheep counting which was traditionally used in the Lake District. Though now rare, it is still used by some and taught in local schools.\n*Heaf (a variant of [[wikt:heft|heft]]) \u2013 the \"home territory\" of a flock of sheep\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|North West England|Cumbria}}\n*[[Regions of England]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Gannon, P.

Significant towns immediately outside the boundary of the national park include [[Millom]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Kendal]], [[Ulverston]], Dalton-in-Furness, [[Cockermouth]], [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], and [[Grange-over-Sands]]; each of these has important economic links with the area.

It is flanked to the east by the [[A6 road (England)|A6 road]] which runs from Kendal to Penrith (though the National Park extension approved in 2015 is east of the A6). The [[A590 road|A590]] which connects the M6 to [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the [[A5092 road|A5092]] trunk roads cut across its southern fringes and the [[A66 road|A66]] trunk road between Penrith and [[Workington]] cuts across its northern edge. Finally the [[A595 road|A595]] (linking the A66 with the A5092) forms the park boundary from Calder Bridge to Holmrook, then crosses the coastal plain of the park until turning inland at the Whicham Valley.\n\nBesides these, a few [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A roads]] penetrate the area itself, notably the [[A591]] which runs north-westwards from Kendal to Windermere and then on to Keswick. It continues up the east side of [[Bassenthwaite Lake]]. \"The A591, Grasmere, Lake District\" was short-listed in the 2011 [[Google Street View]] awards in the Most Romantic Street category. The [[A593 road|A593]] and [[A5084 road (Great Britain)#Four-digit roads (50xx)|A5084]] link the Ambleside and Coniston areas with the A590 to the south whilst the [[A592 road|A592]] and [[A5074 road|A5074]] similarly link Windermere with the A590. The A592 also continues northwards from Windermere to [[Ullswater]] and Penrith by way of the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\nSome valleys which are not penetrated by A roads are served by [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B roads]]. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and [[Buttermere, Cumbria|Buttermere]] and links via the [[Honister Pass]] with [[Borrowdale]]. The [[B5292 road|B5292]] ascends the [[Whinlatter Pass]] from Lorton Vale before dropping down to [[Braithwaite]] near Keswick. The [[B5322 road|B5322]] serves the valley of [[St John's in the Vale]] whilst [[Great Langdale]] is served by the [[B5343 road|B5343]]. Other valleys such as [[Little Langdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] and [[Duddon Valley|Dunnerdale]] are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] and [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] passes respectively; both of these passes are known for their steep gradients and are together one of the most popular [[Climbing specialist|climbs]] in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Britain's top 10 toughest cycle climbs |last=Warren |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/20/britains-top-10-toughest-cycle-climbs |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> A minor road through the [[Newlands Valley]] connects via [[Newlands Hause]] with the B5289 at Buttermere.

There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere and Coniston.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==== Railways and ferries ====\nThe [[West Coast Main Line]] skirts the eastern edge of the Lake District and the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] passes through the southern and western fringes of the area. A single railway line, the [[Windermere Branch Line]], penetrates from Kendal to Windermere via Staveley. Railways once served Broughton-in-Furness and Coniston (closed to passengers in 1958) and another ran from Penrith to Cockermouth via Keswick (closed west of Keswick in 1966 and completely in 1972). Part of the track of the latter is used by the improved A66 trunk road.\n\nThe [[Cumbrian Coast line]] has three stations within the boundaries of the national park (and additionally [[Drigg]], about a third of a mile from the park boundary). The line gives railway enthusiasts and others a flavour of a pre-[[Beeching cuts|Beeching]] railway line, with features like manually operated level crossing gates, as well as giving a good connection to the steam railway into Eskdale and providing access for cyclists and serious walkers to the Western Fells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/the-cumbrian-coast-railway/|website=Visit Cumbria|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe narrow gauge [[Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway]] runs from [[Ravenglass]] on the west coast up Eskdale as far as Dalegarth Station near the hamlet of Boot, catering for tourists. Another [[heritage railway]], the [[Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway]], runs between Lake Windermere and [[Haverthwaite]], and tourists can connect at Lakeside with the boats up the lake to Bowness.\n\nA vehicle-carrying [[cable ferry]], the [[Windermere Ferry]], runs frequent services across Windermere. There are also seasonal passenger boats on Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater.\n\n==== Footpaths and bridleways ====\nThere are many paths over which the public has a [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]], all of which should be signposted. Within the area of the National Park in 2012 there were {{convert|2159|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public footpath (England and Wales)|public footpaths]],\n{{convert|875|km|abbr=on}} of [[Public bridleway (England and Wales)|public bridleways]],\n{{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} of [[restricted byway]]s and\n{{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of [[Byway open to all traffic|byways open to all traffic]].

However the apparent radial pattern is not from a central dome, but from an axial watershed extending west-east from St Bees Head to Shap. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin, and often contain elongate lakes occupying sizeable [[bedrock]] hollows, with tracts of relatively flat ground at their infilled heads, or where they are divided by lateral tributaries (Buttermere-Crummock Water; Derwent Water-Bassenthwaite Lake). Smaller lakes known as [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] occupy [[cirque (landform)|glacial cirques]] at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District. The mountains of the Lake District are also known as the \"Cumbrian Mountains\", although this name is less frequently used than terms like \"the Lake District\" or \"the Lakeland Fells\". As the highest ground in England, [[Scafell Pike]] (978m/3210') naturally has a very extensive view on a clear day, ranging from the Galloway Hills of Scotland to the [[Mourne Mountains]] in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and [[Snowdonia]] in Wales.\n{{wide image|Annotated Scafel Pike Panorama.jpg|3000px|A panorama from the summit of Scafell Pike, August 2007}}\n\nMany of the higher [[fell]]s are rocky, while [[moorland]] predominates at lower altitudes. Vegetation cover across better drained areas includes [[bracken]] and [[Calluna|heather]], though much of the land is [[bog]]gy, due to the high rainfall. Deciduous native woodland occurs on many of the  steeper slopes below the [[tree line]], but with native oak supplemented by extensive conifer plantations in many areas, particularly [[Grizedale Forest]] in the generally lower southern part of the area.  The Lake District extends to the sea to the west and south.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/maps/sharing|title=Maps|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Wasdale screes.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the Wasdale screes descending into [[Wastwater]], the deepest lake in England.}}\n\n=== Valleys ===\n[[File:The Tongue Valley (looking from Dollywaggon Pike), near Troutbeck, Cumbria, at the Lake District National Park, United Kingdom, Europe (November 2008).jpg|thumb|The Tongue Valley (looking from ''Dollywaggon Pike'')]]\nThe principal radial valleys are (clockwise from the south) [[Dunnerdale]], [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]], [[Wasdale]], [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]], the Vale of Lorton and [[Buttermere]] valley, the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|Derwent Valley]] and [[Borrowdale]], the Ullswater valley, Haweswater valley, [[Longsleddale]], the [[Kentmere]] valley, those converging on the head of Windermere - Grasmere, [[Great Langdale]] and Little Langdale, and the Coniston Water valley. The valleys break the mountains up into separate blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered approach is that made popular by [[Alfred Wainwright]] who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.\n\n=== Woodlands ===\nBelow the [[tree line]] are wooded areas, including British and European native [[oak]] woodlands and introduced softwood plantations. The woodlands provide habitats for native English wildlife. The native [[red squirrel]] is found in the Lake District and in a few other parts of England. In parts of the Lake District the rainfall is higher than in any other part of England. This gives [[Atlantic]] [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[lichen]], and [[liverwort]]s the chance to grow. There is some [[ancient woodland]] in the National Park. Management of the woodlands varies: some are [[coppice]]d, some [[pollarding|pollarded]], some left to grow naturally, and some provide grazing and shelter.\n\n=== Fells (hills) ===\n[[File:Scafell massif.jpg|thumb|The impressive bulk of the [[Scafell]] massif, the highest ground in England, seen over [[Wasdale]].]]\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Some major fells and towns'''}}|places=\n<!-- Fells -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell Pike]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=16|position=right\n|lat=54.454222|long=-3.211528}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Scafell]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.448|long=-3.225}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Helvellyn]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=left\n|lat=54.527|long=-3.016}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label='''[[Skiddaw]]'''\n|label_size=100|mark=Montanya.svg|link=|marksize=12|position=right\n|lat=54.647|long=-3.146}}\n<!-- High Raise gets in the way and isn't very high\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|Raise]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Raise (Langdale)|High]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.476|long=-3.113}}-->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=right\n|lat=54.492|long=-2.865}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmoor]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.571|long=-3.279}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Old Man]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.37|long=-3.119}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Great Gable]]\n|label_size=100|mark=Blue Fire.svg|link=|marksize=9|position=left\n|lat=54.482|long=-3.219}}\n<!-- Places -->\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Kendal}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.326|long=-2.745}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Penrith}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.6648|long=-2.7548}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Keswick}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.59|long=-3.14}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Ambleside}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.4251|long=-2.9626}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Cockermouth}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=left|lat=54.6613|long=-3.362}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Windermere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=right|lat=54.376|long=-2.907}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label={{font color|green|Grasmere}}|label_size=|mark=Location dot green.svg|link=|marksize=6|position=top|lat=54.45809|long=-3.02459}}\n}}\n{{See also|list of fells in the Lake District|list of hills in the Lake District}}\nThe four highest mountains in the Lake District exceed {{convert|3000|ft|m|0}}.

They culminate in the {{convert|931|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak of [[Skiddaw]]. Other notable peaks are [[Blencathra]] (also known as Saddleback) ({{convert|868|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Carrock Fell]]. [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] occupies the valley between this massif and the North Western Fells.\n\n==== North Western Fells ====\nThe [[North Western Fells]] lie between [[Borrowdale]] and Bassenthwaite Lake to the east and [[Buttermere]] and [[Lorton Vale]] to the west. Their southernmost point is at [[Honister Pass]]. This area includes the Derwent Fells above the [[Newlands Valley]] and hills to the north amongst which are [[Dale Head]], [[Robinson (Lake District)|Robinson]]. To the north stand [[Grasmoor]], highest in the range at {{convert|852|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Grisedale Pike]] and the hills around the valley of [[Coledale (Cumbria)|Coledale]], and in the far north west is Thornthwaite Forest and [[Lord's Seat]]. The fells in this area are rounded [[Skiddaw slate]], with few tarns and relatively few rock faces.\n\n==== Western Fells ====\n[[File:Westmorland cairn Great Gable.jpg|thumb|The view towards [[Wast Water]] from the cairn built by the Westmorland brothers in 1876 to the SW of the summit of [[Great Gable]], which they considered the finest view in the district.]]\nThe [[Western Fells]] lie between Buttermere and [[Wasdale]], with [[Sty Head]] forming the apex of a large triangle. [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] bisects the area, which consists of the [[High Stile]] ridge north of Ennerdale, the [[Loweswater Fells]] in the far north west, the [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]] group in the south west, and [[Great Gable]] ({{convert|2949|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}) near Sty Head. Other tops include [[Seatallan]], [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and [[Kirk Fell]]. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. [[Wastwater]], located in this part, is England's deepest lake.\n\n==== Central Fells ====\nThe [[Central Fells]] are lower in elevation than surrounding areas of fell, peaking at {{convert|762|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[High Raise, Langdale|High Raise]]. They take the form of a ridge running between [[Derwent Water]] in the west and [[Thirlmere]] in the east, from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the north to [[Langdale Pikes]] in the south. A spur extends south east to [[Loughrigg Fell]] above [[Ambleside]]. The central ridge running north over [[High Seat, Lake District|High Seat]] is exceptionally boggy.\n\n==== Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Glenridding, Cumbria, England - June 2009.jpg|thumb|The village of [[Glenridding]] and [[Ullswater]] lake]]\nThe [[Eastern Fells]] consist of a long north-to-south [[ridge]], the [[Helvellyn range]], running from [[Clough Head]] to [[Seat Sandal]] with the {{convert|3118|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Helvellyn]] at its highest point. The western slopes of these summits tend to be grassy, with rocky [[Cirque|corries]] and [[cliff|crags]] on the eastern side. The [[Fairfield (Lake District)|Fairfield]] group lies to the south of the range, and forms a similar pattern with towering rock faces and hidden valleys spilling into the [[Patterdale]] valley. It culminates in the height of [[Red Screes]] overlooking the [[Kirkstone Pass]].\n\n==== Far Eastern Fells ====\n[[File:Haweswater from Harter Fell 3.jpg|thumb|[[Haweswater Reservoir]] from [[Harter Fell (Mardale)|Harter Fell]]]]\nThe [[Far Eastern Fells]] refer to all of the Lakeland fells to the east of Ullswater and the A592 road running south to Windermere. At {{convert|828|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the peak known as [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]] is the highest point on a complex ridge which runs broadly north\u2013south and overlooks the hidden valley of [[Haweswater Reservoir|Haweswater]] to its east. In the north of this region are the lower fells of Martindale Common and Bampton Common whilst in the south are the fells overlooking the [[Kentmere]] valley. Further to the east, beyond [[Mardale]] and [[Longsleddale]] is [[Shap]] Fell, an extensive area consisting of high [[moorland]], more rolling and [[Pennines|Pennine]] in nature than the mountains to the west.\n\n==== Southern Fells ====\n[[File:Coniston Water from Holme Fell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coniston Water]] from [[Holme Fell]]]]\nThe [[Southern Fells]] occupy the southwestern quarter of the Lake District. They can be regarded as comprising a northern grouping between Wasdale, Eskdale and the two Langdale valleys, a southeastern group east of Dunnerdale and south of Little Langdale and a southwestern group bounded by Eskdale to the north and Dunnerdale to the east.\n\nThe first group includes England's highest mountains: [[Scafell Pike]] in the centre, at {{convert|3209|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} and [[Scafell]] {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} to the southwest. Though it is slightly lower it has a {{convert|700|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} rockface, Scafell Crag, on its northern side. It also includes the [[Wastwater Screes]] overlooking Wasdale, the [[Glaramara]] ridge overlooking Borrowdale, the three tops of [[Crinkle Crags]], [[Bowfell]] and [[Esk Pike]]. The core of the area is drained by the infant [[River Esk, Cumbria|River Esk]]. Collectively these are some of the Lake District's most rugged hillsides.\n\nThe second group, otherwise known as the [[Furness Fells]] or Coniston Fells, have as their northern boundary the steep and narrow  [[Hardknott Pass|Hardknott]] and [[Wrynose Pass|Wrynose]] passes. The highest are [[Old Man of Coniston]] and [[Swirl How]] which slightly exceed {{convert|800|m|-2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe third group to the west of the Duddon includes [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]] and the long ridge leading over [[Whitfell]] to [[Black Combe]] and the sea. The south of this region consists of lower forests and knolls, with [[Kirkby Moor]] on the southern boundary. The southwestern Lake District ends near the [[Furness]] peninsula and [[Barrow-in-Furness]], a town which many Lake District residents rely on for basic amenities.\n\n==== Southeastern area ====\nThe southeastern area is the territory between [[Coniston Water]] and [[Windermere]] and east of Windermere towards Kendal and south to Lindale. There are no high summits in this area which is mainly low hills, knolls and limestone [[cuesta]]s such as [[Gummer's How]] and [[Whitbarrow]]. Indeed, it rises only as high as {{convert|333|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Top o' Selside]] east of Coniston Water; the wide expanse of [[Grizedale Forest]] stands between the two lakes. [[Kendal]] and [[Morecambe Bay]] stand at the eastern and southern edges of the area.\n\n=== Lakes ===\n{{Wide image|Derwent Water, Keswick - June 2009.jpg|1200px|Derwent Water, one of 21 large water bodies in the Lake District}}\n{{See also|List of lakes in the Lake District}}\n{{location map+|United Kingdom Lake District|relief=1|width=300|maplink=|float=|caption={{center|'''Major lakes'''}}|places=\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Bassenthwaite Lake|Bassenthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.65|long=-3.216667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Brothers Water|Brotherswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=bottom|lat=54.505556|long=-2.925}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Buttermere|Butter-<br />mere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.266667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Coniston Water|Coniston]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.335|long=-3.08}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Crummock Water|Crummock]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.56|long=-3.308}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Derwent Water|Derwent<br />Water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.574|long=-3.145}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Elter Water|Elterwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.427469|long=-3.025875}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.52|long=-3.376111}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Esthwaite Water|Esthwaite]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.359|long=-2.99}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Grasmere (lake)|Grasmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.448834|long=-3.020897}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Haweswater Reservoir|Hawes-<br />water]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.518889|long=-2.804722}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Loweswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.5825|long=-3.355278}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Rydal Water]]'''|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.446944|long=-2.996389}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Thirlmere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.533333|long=-3.066667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Ullswater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.5775|long=-2.8751}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Wastwater]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=left|lat=54.441667|long=-3.291667}}\n{{location map~|United Kingdom Lake District\n|label=[[Windermere]]|label_size=|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=|marksize=7|position=right|lat=54.390|long=-2.944}}\n}}\nOnly one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, [[Bassenthwaite Lake]].

The intertidal zone of the combined estuaries includes sand, shingle and mudflats and [[saltmarsh]]. The dune systems on either side of the estuary are protected as nature reserves; Drigg Dunes and Gullery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cwr.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?Site=6167|title=Defra, UK - Rural Affairs|website=cwr.defra.gov.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the north and Eskmeals Dunes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/eskmeals-dunes|title=Eskmeals Dunes &#124; Cumbria Wildlife Trust|website=www.cumbriawildlifetrust.org.uk|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref> to the south. South of the estuary the coast is formed in low cliffs of glacial [[till]], sands and gravels.<ref>http://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex/home.html  BGS Geoindex Onshore</ref>\n\nThe district also extends to the tidal waters of [[Morecambe Bay]] and several of its estuaries alongside the [[Furness Peninsula|Furness]] and [[Cartmel Peninsula]]s, designated on M6 motorway signposts as the \"Lake District Peninsulas\", and the southern portions of which lie outside the park. These are the [[Duddon Estuary]], the [[River Leven, Cumbria|Leven Estuary]], and the western banks and tidal flats of the [[River_Kent#Lower_river|Kent Estuary]]. These areas are each characterised by sand and mudflats of scenic and wildlife interest. The coast is backed by extensive flats of raised marine deposits left when relative sea level was higher.\n\n== Geology ==\n{{main|Geology of the Lake District}}\n[[File:Lake District Geology Map.svg|thumb|Geological map of the Lake District showing the main structures and areas of mineralisation]]\n[[File:Skiddaw (cropped).JPG|thumb|Skiddaw seen from Derwentwater]]\nThe Lake District's geology is very complex but well-studied.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\">Gannon, ''Rock Trails Lakeland''</ref> A [[granite]] [[batholith]] beneath the area is responsible for this upland massif, its relatively low density causing the area to be \"buoyed up\". The granite can be seen at the surface as the Ennerdale, Skiddaw, Carrock Fell, Eskdale and Shap granites.\n\nBroadly speaking the area can be divided into three bands, the divisions between which run south west to north east. Generally speaking the rocks become younger from north west to south east. The north western band is composed of early to mid-[[Ordovician]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, largely [[mudstone]]s and [[siltstone]]s of marine origin. Together they comprise the [[Skiddaw Group]] and include the rocks traditionally known as the [[Skiddaw Slate]]s. Their [[friability]] generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.\n\nThe central band is a mix of [[volcanic]] and sedimentary rocks of mid-to-late Ordovician age comprising the [[lava]]s and [[tuff]]s of the [[Borrowdale Volcanic Group]], erupted as the former [[Iapetus Ocean]] was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath what is now the Scottish border during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. The northern central peaks, such as Great Rigg, were produced by considerable lava flows. These lava eruptions were followed by a series of [[Pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] eruptions which produced a series of calderas, one of which includes present-day Scafell Pike. These pyroclastic rocks give rise to the craggy landscapes typical of the central fells.<ref name=\"Gannon, Rock Trails Lakeland\"/>\n\nThe south eastern band comprises the mudstones and [[wacke]]s of the [[Windermere Supergroup]] and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston and Kendal groups. These are generally a little less resistant to erosion than the rocks sequence to the north and underlie much of the lower landscapes around Coniston and Windermere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nLater [[intrusion]]s have formed individual outcrops of [[igneous rock]] in each of these groups.\nAround the edges of these Ordovician and Silurian rocks on the northern, eastern and southern fringes of the area is a semi-continuous outcrop of [[Carboniferous Limestone]] seen most spectacularly at places like [[Whitbarrow Scar]] and [[Scout Scar]].\n<ref>British Geological Survey Regional memoir ''Northern England'' 5th edn 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/171188/factsheet_geology.pdf|title=Geology Factsheet|publisher=Lake District National Park Authority Web|date=May 24, 2017|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe Lake District's location on the northwest coast of England, coupled with its mountainous geography, makes it the wettest part of England. The UK [[Met Office]] reports average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}}, but with very large local variation.\n\nAlthough the entire region receives above average rainfall, there is a wide disparity between the amount of rainfall in the western and eastern lakes, as the Lake District experiences [[relief rainfall]]. [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite, Borrowdale]] is the wettest inhabited place in England with an average of {{convert|3300|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} of rain a year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|title=UK regional climates|work=Met Office|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003213/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw|archivedate=5 June 2011}}</ref> while nearby [[Sprinkling Tarn]] is even wetter, recording over {{convert|5000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} per year<ref>{{cite web |last1=Visit Cumbria |title=Lake District weather |url=https://www.visitcumbria.com/lake-district-weather/ |website=visitcumbria.com |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lake District Weatherline |title=Overview of weather |url=https://www.lakedistrictweatherline.co.uk/ |website=Lake District Weatherline |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref>; by contrast, Keswick, at the end of [[Borrowdale]] receives {{convert|1470|mm|in|abbr=on}} every year, and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] (just outside the Lake District) only {{convert|870|mm|in|abbr=on}}. March to June tend to be the driest months, with October to January the wettest, but at low levels there is relatively little difference between months.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAlthough sheltered valleys experience [[gale]]s on an average of only five days a year, the Lake District is generally very windy with the coastal areas having 20 days of gales, and the fell tops around 100 days of gales per year. The maritime climate means that the Lake District experiences relatively moderate temperature variations through the year. Mean temperature in the valleys ranges from about {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in January to around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in July. (By comparison, [[Moscow]], at the same latitude, ranges from {{convert|-10|to|19|C|F|abbr=on}}.)\n\nThe relatively low height of most of the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on [[Helvellyn]] 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.\n{{Weather box <!-- Infobox begins -->\n|collapsed=    <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

In 2002, the [[Environment Agency]] introduced a new fisheries byelaw, banning the use of all freshwater fish as live or dead bait in 14 of the lakes in the Lake District. Anglers not complying with the new byelaw can face fines of up to \u00a32,500. There are 14 lakes in the Lake District which are affected. These are: Bassenthwaite Lake, Brothers Water, Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Derwent Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Red Tarn, Thirlmere, Ullswater, Wast Water and Windermere.\n\nThe lakes and waters of the Lake District do not naturally support as many species of fish as other similar habitats in the south of the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some fish that do thrive there are particularly at risk from introduction of new species.\n\nThe introduction of non-native fish can lead to the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with [[ruffe]]. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example [[Rutilus|roach]], are only at risk for as little as three days.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Agriculture and forestry ===\n[[File:Forestry on Harter Fell.jpg|thumb|Forestry operations on [[Harter Fell, Eskdale|Harter Fell]]]]\n\nFarming, and in particular [[Domestic sheep|sheep farming]], has been the major industry in the region since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. The breed most closely associated with the area is the tough [[Herdwick]], with [[Rough Fell]] and [[Swaledale (sheep)|Swaledale]] sheep also common. Sheep farming remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see. Features such as [[dry stone wall]]s, for example, are there as a result of sheep farming. Some land is also used for [[silage]] and [[dairy farming]].\n\nThe area was badly affected by the outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in [[Surrey]] in February, but had spread to [[Cumbria]] by end of March.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lake District 'nightmare' as fell farm is infected |last=Cadwalladr |first=Carole |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1327961/Lake-District-nightmare-as-fell-farm-is-infected.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Thousands of sheep, including the native [[Herdwick]]s which graze on the fellsides across the district, were destroyed. In replacing the sheep, one problem to overcome was that many of the lost sheep were ''heafed'', that is, they knew their part of the unfenced fell and did not stray, with this knowledge being passed between generations. With all the sheep lost at once, this knowledge has to be relearnt and some of the fells have had discreet [[electric fence]]s strung across them for a period of five years, to allow the sheep to \"re-heaf\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=If they go, it is the end of Lakeland |last=Griffin |first=Harry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/11/footandmouth.features11 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> At the time of the outbreak, worries existed about the future of certain species of sheep such as [[Ryeland]] and Herdwick in the district,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rare breeds 'could be lost' |last=MacClean |first=Matt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1233458.stm |work=BBC News |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> however these fears have been allayed and sheep now occupy the district in abundance.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sheep breed resurrected decade on from foot and mouth |last=Clarke |first=Tom |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sheep-breed-resurrected-decade-on-from-foot-and-mouth |work=Channel 4 News |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Thirleme 069.jpg|thumb|A young [[Herdwick]] grazing above [[Thirlmere]]. Older sheep of this breed are grey or white.]]\n\nForestry has also assumed greater importance over the course of the last century with the establishment of extensive conifer plantations around [[Whinlatter Pass]], in [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] and at [[Grizedale Forest]] amongst other places. There are extensive plantations of non-native pine trees.\n\n=== Industry ===\nWith its wealth of rock types and their abundance in the landscape, mining and quarrying have long been significant activities in the Lake District economy. In [[Neolithic]] times, the Lake District was a major source of stone [[axe]]s, examples of which have been found all over Britain. The primary site, on the slopes of the Langdale Pikes, is sometimes described as a \"stone axe factory\" of the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Some of the earliest [[stone circle]]s in Britain are connected with this industry.\n\nMining, particularly of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), [[baryte]], [[graphite]] and [[slate]], was historically a major Lakeland industry, mainly from the 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide [[charcoal]] for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the [[Honister Slate Mine|Honister Mines]], at the top of [[Honister Pass]]. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite led to the development of the [[pencil]] industry, especially around [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]].\n\n[[File:Lake District near Torver.jpg|thumb|A typical Lake District scene]]\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, half the world textile industry's [[bobbin]] supply came from the Lake District area. Over the past century, however, tourism has grown rapidly to become the area's primary source of income.\n\n=== Development of tourism ===\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2011}}\nEarly visitors to the Lake District, who travelled for the education and pleasure of the journey, include [[Celia Fiennes]] who in 1698 undertook a journey the length of England, including riding through [[Kendal]] and over [[Kirkstone Pass]] into [[Patterdale]]. Her experiences and impressions were published in her book ''Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall'':\n\n<blockquote>As I walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren hills which hang over one\u2019s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents of water from the sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=81JxDbc2KeIC&pg=PA183&dq=descends+into+the+bottoms+which+are+a+Moorish+ground&hl=en&ei=phdrTvmvHI_sOdbgrdcF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=descends%20into%20the%20bottoms%20which%20are%20a%20Moorish%20ground&f=false An Anthology of Women's Travel Writing \u2013 Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] published the first volume of ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain''. He commented on [[Westmorland]] that it was:\n\n<blockquote>the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even Wales itself; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which, in the language of the country, are called fells.</blockquote>\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the area was becoming more popular with travellers. This was partly a result of wars in [[Continental Europe]], restricting the possibility of travel there. In 1778 [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]] produced ''A Guide to the Lakes'', which began the era of modern tourism.\n\n[[File:Claife Station.jpg|thumb|Claife Station on the western shore of [[Windermere]]]]\nWest listed \"stations\", viewpoints where tourists could enjoy the best views of the landscape, being encouraged to appreciate the formal qualities of the landscape and to apply aesthetic values. At some of these stations, buildings were erected to help this process. The remains of Claife Station (on the western shore [[Windermere]] below [[Claife Heights]]) can be visited today.\n\n[[William Wordsworth]] published his ''Guide to the Lakes'' in 1810, and by 1835 it had reached its fifth edition, now called ''A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England''. This book was particularly influential in popularising the region. Wordsworth's favourite valley was Dunnerdale or the [[Duddon Valley]] nestling in the south west of the Lake District.\n\nThe railways led to another expansion in tourism. The [[Kendal and Windermere Railway]] was the first to penetrate the Lake District, reaching [[Kendal]] in 1846 and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] in 1847. The line to [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network with ferries between [[Fleetwood]] and [[Barrow-in-Furness]]); the line from [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] through [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] to [[Cockermouth]] in 1865; and the line to [[Lakeside, Cumbria|Lakeside]] at the foot of [[Windermere]] in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge increase in the number of visitors, thus contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of [[Ullswater]], Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], and [[Derwent Water]].\n\n[[File:STEAMER ON ULLSWATER.jpg|thumb|A steamer on [[Ullswater]]]]\n\nThe growth in tourist numbers continued into the age of the motor car, when railways began to be closed or run down. The formation of the [[Lake District National Park]] in 1951 recognised the need to protect the Lake District environment from excessive commercial or industrial exploitation, preserving that which visitors come to see, without any restriction on the movement of people into and around the district. The [[M6 Motorway]] helped bring traffic to the Lake District, passing up its eastern flank. The narrow roads present a challenge for traffic flow and, from the 1960s, certain areas have been very congested.\n\nWhilst the roads and railways provided easier access to the area, many people were drawn to Lakeland by the publication of the ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' by [[Alfred Wainwright]]. First published between 1955 and 1966, these books provided detailed information on 214 fells across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of [[Peak bagging|bagging]] the complete list of ''[[List of Wainwrights|Wainwrights]]''. The famous guides were revised by [[Chris Jesty]] between 2005 and 2009 to reflect changes, mainly in valley access and paths, and are currently being revised by Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion. The first of the revised volumes, Book One: The Eastern Fells, was published in March 2015; the most recent, Book Six: The North Western Fells, was published in April 2019.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/13/books.ruralaffairs | work=The Guardian | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | title=Famed fells guides join the 21st century | date=13 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nSince the early 1960s, the National Park Authority has employed rangers to help cope with increasing tourism and development, the first being [[John Wyatt (writer)|John Wyatt]], who has since written a number of guide books. He was joined two years later by a second, and since then the number of rangers has been rising.\n\nThe area has also become associated with writer [[Beatrix Potter]]. A number of tourists visit to see her family home, with particularly large numbers coming from Japan.\n\nTourism has now become the park's major industry, with about 12&nbsp;million visitors each year, mainly from the UK's larger settlements, China, Japan, Spain, Germany and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel |title=Desintations: Lake District |publisher=BBC\\ |date=27 January 2005 |archivedate=27 January 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127144348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/holiday/destinations/lake_district_cartmel/ }}</ref> Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria's most popular charging tourist attraction with about 1.35&nbsp;million paying customers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. [[Soil erosion]], caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two [[Visitor center|tourist information centres]] in the National Park were closed.\n\nCycling is now popular in the Lake District National Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/cycling|title=Lake District cycling|date=2017-04-25|website=Lake District National Park|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> A number of long-distance cycle routes go through the Lake District, including coast to coast cycle routes such as the [[Coast to Coast Cycle Route|C2C]], Hadrian\u2019s Cycleway, the Reivers Route and the Walney to Wear route. Several towns have also become hubs for road-cycling holidays and cycle touring, such as [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] and [[Ambleside]]. Mountain bikers use the trails constructed at Whinlatter Forest<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestryengland.uk/whinlatter/cycling-and-mountain-biking-trails-whinlatter|title=Cycling and mountain biking trails at Whinlatter|website=Forestry England|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> and Grizedale Forest and also have wilder routes available on bridleways. \n\nCultural tourism is becoming an increasingly important part of the wider tourist industry. The Lake District's links with a wealth of artists and writers and its strong history of providing summer theatre performances in the old Blue Box of Century Theatre are strong attractions for visiting tourists. The tradition of theatre is carried on by venues such as [[Theatre by the Lake]] in Keswick with its summer season of six plays in [[repertoire (theatre)|repertoire]], Christmas and Easter productions, and the many literature, film, mountaineering, jazz and creative arts festivals, such as the [[Kendal Mountain Festival]] and the [[Keswick Mountain Festival]].\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nExcellent mutton and lamb has been produced locally for generations and traditionally formed the basis of the region's many rustic dishes, such as Tatie Pot, a potato-topped mutton casserole.

[[Thomas Gray]] was the first to bring the region to attention, when he wrote a journal of his [[Grand Tour]] in 1769, but it was [[William Wordsworth]] whose poems were most famous and influential. Wordsworth's poem \"[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud]]\", inspired by the sight of [[daffodils]] on the shores of Ullswater, remains one of the most famous in the English language. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at [[Hawkshead]], and afterwards living in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] (1799\u20131813) and [[Rydal Mount]] (1813\u201350). Wordsworth, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey|Southey]] became known as the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nThe poet and his wife lie buried in the churchyard of Grasmere and very near to them are the remains of [[Hartley Coleridge]] (son of the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), who himself lived for many years in Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere. [[Robert Southey]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] and friend of Wordsworth (who would succeed Southey as Laureate in 1843), was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803\u201343), and was buried in [[St Kentigern's Church, Crosthwaite|Crosthwaite churchyard]]. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived for some time in Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at Grasmere. From 1807 to 1815 [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] lived at Windermere. [[Thomas de Quincey]] spent the greater part of the years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place of residence both of [[Thomas Arnold]], who spent there the vacations of the last ten years of his life and of [[Harriet Martineau]], who built herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick, Mrs Lynn Linton (wife of [[William James Linton]]) was born, in 1822. [[Brantwood]], a house beside Coniston Water, was the home of [[John Ruskin]] during the last years of his life. His assistant [[W. G. Collingwood]] the author, artist and antiquarian lived nearby, and wrote ''Thorstein of the Mere,'' set in the Norse period.\n\nIn addition to these residents or natives of the Lake District, a variety of other poets and writers made visits to the Lake District or were bound by ties of friendship with those already mentioned above. These include [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], [[Henry Crabb Robinson]], [[Richard Sharp (politician)|\"Conversation\" Sharp]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Keats]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Gerald Massey]].\n\nAlthough it is unlikely she ever went there, [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] produced no less than sixteen poems on subjects within the Lake District and its surroundings, all associated with engravings within Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books, from 1832 to 1838. Also included there (1834) is ''Grasmere Lake (A Sketch by a Cockney)'', a skit on becoming a 'lakes poet'.\n\nThe English composer Sir [[Arthur Somervell]] (1863 \u2013 1937) was born in Windermere.\n \nDuring the early 20th century, the children's author [[Beatrix Potter]] was in residence at [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top]] Farm, setting many of her famous [[Peter Rabbit]] books in the Lake District. Her life was made into a [[Miss Potter|biopic film]], starring [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Ewan McGregor]]. [[Arthur Ransome]] lived in several areas of the Lake District, and set five of his [[Swallows and Amazons series]] of books, published between 1930 and 1947, in a fictionalised Lake District setting. So did [[Geoffrey Trease]] with his five Black Banner school stories (1949\u201356), starting with ''[[No Boats on Bannermere]]''.\n\nThe novelist [[Hugh Walpole|Sir Hugh Walpole]] lived at \"Brackenburn\" on the lower slopes of [[Catbells]] overlooking Derwent Water from 1924 until his death in 1941. Whilst living at \"Brackenburn\" he wrote ''The Herries Chronicle'' detailing the history of a fictional Cumbrian family over two centuries. The noted author and poet [[Norman Nicholson]] came from the south west lakes, living and writing about [[Millom]] in the 20th century \u2013 he was known as the last of the [[Lake Poets]] and came close to becoming the Poet Laureate.\n\nThe Lakes has been an inspirations for many notable artists. Some of the most famous artists to depict the region in their work have been [[Alfred Heaton Cooper]] and [[William Heaton Cooper]].\n\nWriter and author [[Melvyn Bragg]] was brought up in the region and has used it as the setting for some of his work, such as his novel ''A Time to Dance'', later turned into a television drama.\n\nThe Lake District has been the setting for crime novels by [[Reginald Hill]], [[Val McDermid]] and [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]]. The region is also a recurring theme in [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s 1926 novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'' and features prominently in [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Amsterdam (novel)|Amsterdam]]'', which won the 1998 [[Booker Prize]]. The 1996 [[Eisner Award]] winning graphic novel [[The Tale of One Bad Rat]] by [[Bryan Talbot]] featured a young girl's journey to and subsequent stay in the Lake District.\n\nThe Lake District is mentioned in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''; [[Elizabeth Bennet]] looks forward to a holiday there with her aunt and uncle and is \"excessively disappointed\" upon learning they cannot travel that far.\n\nThe opening of [[Charlotte Turner Smith]]'s novel ''Ethelinde'' with its atmospheric description of [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], complete with a Gothic abbey, is supposed to have induced Wordsworth into looking to it as a possible place of residence.\n\nFilm director [[Ken Russell]] lived in the Keswick/Borrowdale area from 1975 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |title=Coombe Cottage |publisher=Thelakedistrict.info |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218052207/http://www.thelakedistrict.info/2008/11/coombe-cottage.html |archivedate=18 February 2009}}</ref> and used it in films such as ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' and ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]''.\n\nThe German artist [[Kurt Schwitters]] visited the Lake District while in exile in Great Britain and moved there permanently in June 1945, remaining there for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Lake District is the setting for the 1977 [[Richard Adams]] novel ''[[The Plague Dogs]]''. Adams' knowledge of the area offers the reader a precise view of the natural beauty of the Lake District. The story is based at a fictionalised version of the remote hill farm of Lawson Park, overlooking Coniston Water. The base of contemporary art commissioner and residency base [[Grizedale Arts]] since 2007, Lawson Park now hosts artists' residencies, opens to the public on occasion, and has developed a significant garden that includes art works alongside extensive plantings. Grizedale Arts has produced many internationally-significant cultural projects and has proved instrumental in the careers of several [[Turner Prize]]-winning artists, making Laure Provoust's winning installation 'Wantee' at Lawson Park, and bringing the exhibition to Coniston's [[Ruskin Museum]] in 2013. It also supported the refurbishment of the historic [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] Institute and developed an Honest Shop there (opening in 2012), an unstaffed shop stocking local crafts and produce.\n\nThe [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]] at Keswick was started by [[Canon Rawnsley]], a friend of [[John Ruskin]].\n\nAlso set in the Lake District is Sophie Jackson's mystery novel ''The Woman Died Thrice''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clara Fitzgerald Mysteries |url=http://sophiejackson1984.wixsite.com/sophiejackson/fiction |website=Sophie Jackson's website |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}</ref> It was published in 2016 under Jackson's pen name Evelyn James.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nA number of words and phrases are local to the Lake District and are part of the [[Cumbrian dialect]], though many are shared by other northern dialects. These include:\n\n*[[Fell]] \u2013 from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|fjallr}}, brought to England by [[Viking]] invaders and close to modern Norwegian {{lang|no|fjell}} and Swedish {{lang|sv|fj\u00e4ll}} meaning mountain\n*Howe \u2013 place name from the [[Old Norse]] ''haugr'' meaning hill, knoll, or mound\n*[[tarn (lake)|Tarn]] \u2013 a word that has been taken to mean a small lake situated in a [[Cirque|corrie]] (the local name for which is ''cove'' or ''comb''), a local phrase for any small pool of water. The word is derived from the [[Old Norse]], Norwegian and Swedish word ''tjern/tj\u00e4rn'', meaning small lake.\n*[[Yan tan tethera]] \u2013 the name for a system of sheep counting which was traditionally used in the Lake District. Though now rare, it is still used by some and taught in local schools.\n*Heaf (a variant of [[wikt:heft|heft]]) \u2013 the \"home territory\" of a flock of sheep\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|North West England|Cumbria}}\n*[[Regions of England]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Gannon, P.
