The Sultan issued a formal invitation and refugees started arriving in the empire in great numbers.

These Sephardi Jews settled in Constantinople as well as [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nThe Jews satisfied various needs in the Ottoman Empire: the Muslim [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]] were largely uninterested in business enterprises and accordingly left commercial occupations to members of minority religions.

Constantinople had a Jewish community of 30,000 individuals with [[List of synagogues in Turkey|44 synagogues]]. Bayezid allowed the Jews to live on the banks of the [[Golden Horn]]. Egypt Eyalet, especially [[Cairo]], received a large number of the exiles, who soon outnumbered [[Musta'arabi Jews]]. Gradually, the chief center of the Sephardi Jews became Thessaloniki, where the Spanish Jews soon outnumbered coreligionists of other nationalities and, at one time, the original native inhabitants.\n\nAlthough the status of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire may have often been exaggerated,<ref>B. Lewis, The Jews of Islam, PUP, (1987) 137\u2013141</ref> it is undeniable that they enjoyed tolerance.

The Sultan issued a formal invitation and refugees started arriving in the empire in great numbers.

Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-07522-9}}.</ref> At that point in time, Constantinople's population was a mere 70,000 due to the various sieges of the city during the Crusades and the Black Death, so this historical event was also significant for repopulation of the city. These Sephardi Jews settled in Constantinople as well as [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nThe Jews satisfied various needs in the Ottoman Empire: the Muslim [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]] were largely uninterested in business enterprises and accordingly left commercial occupations to members of minority religions. They also distrusted the Christian subjects whose countries had only recently been conquered by the Ottomans and therefore it was natural to prefer Jewish subjects to which this consideration did not apply.<ref name=autogenerated1>H.\nInalcik; The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300\u20131600, Phoenix Press, (2001)</ref>\n[[File:Jewottoman.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of a Jewish man from the Ottoman Empire, 1779.]]\nThe [[Sephardi Jews]] were allowed to settle in the wealthier cities of the empire, especially in [[Rumelia]] (the European provinces, cities such as Constantinople, [[Sarajevo]], Thessaloniki, [[Adrianople]] and [[Nicopolis]]), western and northern Anatolia (Bursa, [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[Tokat]] and [[Amasya]]), but also in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastal regions ([[Jerusalem]], [[Safed]], [[Damascus]], and [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]). [[\u0130zmir]] was not settled by Spanish Jews until later.\n\nThe Jewish population in Jerusalem increased from 70 families in 1488 to 1500 at the beginning of the 16th century. That of Safed increased from 300 to 2000 families and almost surpassed Jerusalem in importance. Damascus had a Sephardic congregation of 500 families. Constantinople had a Jewish community of 30,000 individuals with [[List of synagogues in Turkey|44 synagogues]]. Bayezid allowed the Jews to live on the banks of the [[Golden Horn]]. Egypt Eyalet, especially [[Cairo]], received a large number of the exiles, who soon outnumbered [[Musta'arabi Jews]]. Gradually, the chief center of the Sephardi Jews became Thessaloniki, where the Spanish Jews soon outnumbered coreligionists of other nationalities and, at one time, the original native inhabitants.\n\nAlthough the status of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire may have often been exaggerated,<ref>B. Lewis, The Jews of Islam, PUP, (1987) 137\u2013141</ref> it is undeniable that they enjoyed tolerance. Under the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] they were organized as a community on the basis of religion alongside the other millets (''e.g.'' [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] millet, [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] millet, etc.). In the framework of the millet, they had a considerable amount of administrative [[autonomy]] and were represented by the [[Hakham Bashi]], the Chief Rabbi.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K.

He has written ''Kuraloviam'' for [[Thirukural]], Tholkaappiya Poonga, Poombukar, as well as many poems, essays and books. Apart from literature, Karunanidhi has also contributed to the [[Tamil language]] through art and architecture. Like the Kuraloviyam, in which Kalaignar wrote about Thirukkural, through the construction of [[Valluvar Kottam]] he gave an architectural presence to [[Thiruvalluvar]], in Chennai. At [[Kanyakumari]], Karunanidhi constructed a 133-foot-high statue of Thiruvalluvar in honour of the scholar.\n\n===Books===\nThe books written by Karunanidhi include ''Sanga Thamizh'', ''Thirukkural Urai'', ''[[Ponnar Sankar]]'', ''Romapuri Pandian'', ''[[Thenpandi Singam]]'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Nenjukku Needhi'', ''Iniyavai Irubathu'' and ''Kuraloviam''.

He founded an organisation for the local youth of his locality. He circulated a handwritten newspaper called ''Manavar Nesan'' to its members. Later he founded a student organisation called Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, which was the first student wing of the Dravidan Movement. Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Two people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested.<ref name=\"ramaswamy2210\">[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 1997]], p. 226</ref>\n\n===Rise to power===\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the [[Kulithalai]] seat in the 1957 election.

He has held various positions in the party and government during his long career in Tamil Nadu political arena.\n\n====70's and Emergency====\nDuring the [[Emergency]], the DMK was the only ruling party across India that opposed the Emergency,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} for which his government was summarily dismissed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government and many of his party leaders were arrested and jailed till the Emergency was lifted. Later, the D.M.K teamed up with the [[Janata Party]] post-Emergency, but suffered defeat at the assembly elections under accusations of corruption .\n\nHis one time friend [[M. G. Ramachandran]], who floated his [[AIADMK]] party after being sacked by Karunanidhi from DMK a few years earlier, would come to power in Tamil Nadu. The DMK then suffered multiple electoral defeats against his primary opponent M.G.Ramachandran's AIADMK, until the latter's death in 1987.\n[[File:The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalaignar M.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too.

Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains.
