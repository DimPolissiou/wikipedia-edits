It was particularly used in response to \"crimes against the state\" and regarded across a number of cultures as a very harsh form of [[capital punishment]] and recorded in [[Impalement (in myth and art)|myth and art]]. Impalement was also used during times of war to [[suppression of dissent|suppress]] [[rebellion]]s, punish [[traitors]] or collaborators, and punish [[Insubordination|breaches of military discipline]].\n\nOffenses where impalement was occasionally employed included contempt for the state's responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing [[highway robbery]] or [[grave robbery]], violating state policies or monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders have also been impaled for a variety of cultural, sexual and religious reasons.\n\nReferences to impalement in [[Babylonia]] and the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] are found as early as the 18th century BC.\n\n==Methods==\n\n===Longitudinal impalement===\n[[File:Torture of captain rosinsky by soldies of red army.jpg|thumb|200px|Purported image of Captain Rosinsky, a Polish prisoner of war, being tortured by [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] soldiers, [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], 1918 image by Frenchman Andr\u00e9 Savoir telling his story to ''The New York Times'', 1920 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/08/02/102879148.pdf |title=Sees Bolshevism as Hideous Religion |date=1920-08-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-29|url-status=live|page=2|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>]]\nImpaling an individual along the body length has been documented in several cases, and the merchant [[Jean de Thevenot]] provides an eyewitness account of this from 17th-century Egypt, in the case of a Jewish man condemned to death for the use of false weights:<ref>''Th\u00e9venot'' (1687) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=259&id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p. 259] Other highly detailed accounts on methods are: \n1.

The case of a woman who was to be executed for [[infanticide]] involved an executioner and two assistants. First, a grave some one-and-a-half [[ell]] deep was dug. The woman was then placed within it, her hands and feet were secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave on her heart in order to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth at the behest of the clerics, because to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner used a pair of tongs to grab a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head.

The [[Code of Hammurabi]], promulgated about 1772 BC<ref>[[Middle chronology]] is used here</ref> by the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Babylonian]] king [[Hammurabi]] specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man.<ref>Article 153 in: ''Harper'' (1904), [[s:The Code of Hammurabi (Harper translation)|The Code of Hammurabi]]</ref> In the late [[History of Mesopotamia#Isin-Larsa, Old Babylonian and Shamshi-Adad I|Isin/Larsa period]], from about the same time, it seems that, in some city states, mere adultery on the wife's part (without murder of her husband mentioned) could be punished by impalement.<ref>''Tetlow'' (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&pg=PA34 p. 34]</ref> From the royal archives of the city of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi, it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled.<ref>''Hamblin'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5IQQir5eFEC&pg=PA208 p. 208]</ref> Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of [[Elam]] made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates.<ref>''Herrenschmidt, Bott\u00e9ro'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wwoPiWG3-LQC&pg=PA84 p. 84]</ref> For acts of perceived great sacrilege, some individuals, in diverse cultures, have been impaled for their effrontery. For example, roughly 1200 BC, merchants of [[Ugarit]] express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town [[Sidon]], due to some \"great sin\" committed against the patron deity of Sidon.<ref>''Mayer, ed.''

For the Neo-Assyrians, mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also, it can seem, as proofs of their ''might'' that they took pride in. Neo-Assyrian King [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (r. 883\u2013859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows:<ref>''Olmstead'' (1918), p. 66</ref>{{quote|I cut off their hands, I burned them with fire, a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up, men I impaled on stakes, the city I destroyed and devastated, I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps, the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned}}\n\nPaul Kern,<ref>[http://www.iun.edu/~nwacadem/hppr/faculty/pkern.shtml Paul Kern]</ref> in his (1999) \"Ancient Siege Warfare\", provides some statistics on how different Neo-Assyrian kings from the times of Ashurnasirpal II commemorated their punishments of rebels.<ref>''Kern'' (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FBTesdgIbcsC&pg=PA68 p. 68\u201376].

The passage explains that Haman conspired to have all the Jews in the empire killed but his plan was thwarted, and he was given the punishment he had thought to mete out to [[Mordecai]]. The English Standard Version of Esther 5:14 describes this as ''hanging'',<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Esther+5&version=ESV Book of Esther, ESV Bible edition]</ref> whereas The New International Reader's version opts for ''impalement''.<ref>[http://www.biblica.com/bibles/chapter/?verse=Esther+5&version=nirv Book of Esther, NIRV Bible edition]</ref>\nThe Assyriologist [[Paul Haupt]] opts for impalement in his 1908 essay \"Critical notes on Esther\",<ref>''Haupt'' (1908), p. 122, 152, 154, 170</ref> while Benjamin Shaw has an extended discussion of the topic on the website ligonier.org from 2012.<ref>''Shaw'' (2012), [http://www.ligonier.org/blog/was-haman-hanged-or-impaled/ Was Haman Hanged or Impaled?]</ref>\n\nOther passages in the [[Bible]] may allude to the practice of impalement, such as [[II Samuel]] 21:9 concerning the fate of the sons of [[Saul]], where some English translations use the verb \"impale\", but others use \"hang\".<ref>[https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/21-9-compare.html Compare Translations for 2 Samuel 21:9]</ref>\n\nAlthough we lack conclusive evidence either way for whether Hebrew law allowed for impalement, or for hanging (whether as a mode of execution or for display of the corpse), the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement as seen in carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of ''hanging'' upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual ''penetration'' of the body.\n\n====Rome====\n\nFrom John Granger Cook, 2014: \"''Stipes'' is Seneca's term for the object used for impalement. This narrative and his ''Ep''. 14.5 are the only two textually explicit references to impalement in Latin texts:\"\n\n{{quote|\nI see crosses there, not just of one kind but made differently by different [fabricators]; some individuals suspended their victims with heads inverted toward the ground; some drove a stake (''stipes'') through their excretory organs/genitals; others stretched out their [victims'] arms on a patibulum [cross bar]; I see racks, I see lashes ...\n\n''Video istic cruces ne unius quidem generis sed aliter ab aliis fabricatas; capite quidam conuersos in terram suspendere, alii per obscena stipitem egerunt, alii brachia patibulo explicuerunt; video fidiculas, video uerbera ...'' <ref>''Crucifixion in the Mediterranean World'' by John Granger Cook, 2014, published by Mohr Siebeck,{{ISBN|9783161531248}}</ref>}}\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Transversal impalement====\nWithin the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in article 131 of the 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]], the following punishment was stated for women found guilty of [[infanticide]]. Generally, they should be drowned, but the law code allowed for, in particularly severe cases, that the old punishment could be implemented. That is, the woman would be [[buried alive]], and then a stake would be driven through her heart.<ref name=\"Koch\">For law text, ''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Koch,_Johann_Christoph Koch]'' (1824) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_q_o6AAAAcAAJ <!-- quote=verzweiffelung. --> p. 63]</ref> Similarly, burial alive, combined with transversal impalement is attested as an early execution method for people found guilty of [[adultery]]. The 1348 statutes of [[Zwickau]] allowed punishment of an adulterous couple in the following way: They were to be placed on top of each other in a grave, with a layer of thorns between them. Then, a single stake was to be hammered through them.<ref>''Engel, Jacob'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=OP3hhD7_T6QC&pg=PA75 p. 75] A similar punishment of the couple by impalement for adultery if caught in the act is mentioned in Bavarian sources as well, see ''His'' (1928), p. 150</ref> A similar punishment by impalement for a proven male adulterer is mentioned in a 13th-century ordinance for [[Bohemia]]n mining town [[Jihlava]] (then and German [[Iglau]]),<ref>''Schwetschke'' (1789), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hytRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT351 col. 692]</ref> whereas in a 1340 Vienna statute, the husband of a woman caught [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante'']] in adultery could, if he wished to, demand that his wife and her lover be impaled, or alternatively demand a monetary restitution.<ref>''Ehrlich'' (2005), p. 42</ref> Occasionally, women found guilty of [[witchcraft]] have been condemned to be impaled. In 1587 [[Kiel]], 101-year-old Sunde Bohlen was, on being condemned as a witch, buried alive, and afterwards had a stake driven through her heart.<ref>''Fick'' (1867), [https://books.google.com/books?id=b8JCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>\n\nRapists of [[virgins]] and children are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was to be placed in an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure.<ref>''Engelmann'' (1834)[https://books.google.com/books?jtp=158&id=KOAAAAAAcAAJ p. 158]</ref> Serving as an example of the fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine.

Thereafter, people left him to die.<ref>''[[:de:Eduard Osenbr\u00fcggen|Osenbr\u00fcggen]]'' (1868), [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YWE7AAAAcAAJ/page/n311 p. 297]</ref>\n\n====Longitudinal impalement====\nCases of ''longitudinal'' impalement typically occur in the context of war or as a punishment for [[robbery]], the latter being attested to as the practice in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nIndividuals accused of collaborating with the enemy have, on occasion, been impaled. In 1632 during the [[Thirty Years' War]], the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of [[defecting]] to the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]],<ref>Schwab (1827), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ubmr9w0g9GAC&pg=PA256 p. 256]</ref> a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans.<ref>''Gottfried, van Hulsius'' (1633), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HItOAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA462 p. 462]</ref> In 1654, under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Cretan War (1645\u201369)|siege]] of the [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] garrison at [[Crete]], several peasants were impaled for supplying provisions to the besieged.<ref>''Han'' (1669), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KlZBAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA2-PT55 p. 203]</ref> Likewise in 1685, some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided supplies to the Turks.<ref>''Beer'' (1713), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UT5VAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA127 p. 127]</ref>\n\nIn 1677, a particularly brutal German General Kops leading the forces of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] who wanted to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than allow it to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and [[Dismemberment|quartering]] his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general on the Hungarian side, {{ill|Wessel\u00e9nyi P\u00e1l|lt=Wessel\u00e9nyi|hu}}, responded in kind, by [[flaying]] alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I had enough of the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities.<ref>''von Loen'' (1751), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA420 p. 420\u2013422]</ref> After the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)]], [[Sicily]] fell under [[Habsburg]] rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming that a whole eight days had gone by since he had last killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled.<ref>''von Imhoff'' (1736), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLb5cjzNpz4C&pg=PA1051 p. 1051]</ref> In the short-lived 1784 [[Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an|Horea Revolt]] against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers, whom they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of [[Vasile Ursu Nicola|Horea]]'s 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.<ref>''Mannheimer Zeitung'' (1784), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1BpEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA631 p. 638]</ref> After the revolt was crushed by early 1785, some 150 rebels are said to have been impaled.<ref>''Vehse, Demmler'' (1856), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZVHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA318 p. 318]</ref>\n\nFrom 1748 onwards, German regiments organized manhunts on \"robbers\" in Hungary/Croatia, impaling those who were caught.<ref>''Woltersdorf'' (1812)[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6aBOAAAAcAAJ p. 267]</ref>\n\n==== Heinous murderers ====\nOccasionally, individual murderers were perceived to have been so heinous that standard punishments like [[Decapitation|beheading]] or being [[Breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] were regarded as incommensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. An example is that of Pavel Va\u0161ansk\u00fd (Paul Wasansky in German transcript), who was executed on 1 March 1570 in [[Ivan\u010dice]] in present-day Czech Republic, on account of 124 confessed murders (he was a roaming highwayman). He underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: first, his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers; he was then flayed, impaled and finally roasted alive.

He dealt harshly with his enemies, especially those who had betrayed his family in the past, or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia. Though a [[Vlad III the Impaler#Methods of execution|variety of methods]] were employed, he has been most associated with his use of impalement. The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers, members of a rival clan,<ref name=vlad/> and criminals in his domain, whether they were members of the [[boyar]] nobility or peasants, and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him. Following the multiple campaigns against the invading [[Ottoman Turks]], Vlad would never show mercy to his [[prisoners of war]]. After [[The Night Attack]] of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219 in mid-June 1462 failed to assassinate the Ottoman sultan, the road to [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], the capital of Vlad's [[principality]] of Wallachia, eventually became inundated in a \"forest\" of 20,000 impaled and decaying corpses, and it is reported that [[Mehmet II]]'s invading army of Turks turned back to Constantinople in 1462 after encountering thousands of impaled corpses along the [[Danube River]].<ref name=vlad>{{Citation | last= Axinte|title= Dracula: Between myth and reality |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/rsa/_content/_public/_htm/dracula.shtml}}</ref> [[Woodcut|Woodblock]] prints from the era portray his victims impaled from either the [[anterior|frontal]] or the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] aspect, but not vertically.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nLongitudinal impalement is an execution method often attested within the Ottoman Empire, for a variety of offenses, it was done mostly as a warning to others or to terrify.<ref name=\"Reid2000\">{{cite book|author=James J.

One Venetian captain, Antonio Rizzo, sought to defy the ban, but his ship was hit by a cannonball. He and his crew were picked up from the waters, the crew members to be beheaded (or [[Death by sawing|sawn asunder]] according to [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]]<ref>''Philippides, Hanak'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qvvdVXckfqQC&pg=PA587 p. 587]</ref>), whereas Rizzo was impaled.<ref>''Runciman'' (1965), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAzntP0lg58C&pg=PA67 p. 67]</ref> In the early days of the siege in May 1453, contingents of the Ottoman army made mop-up operations at minor fortifications like [[Therapia]] and Studium.

For some periods at least, executions for civil crimes were claimed to have been rather rare in the Ottoman Empire. [[:sv:Aubry de La Motraye|Aubry de La Motraye]] lived in the realm for 14 years from 1699 to 1713 and claimed that he had not heard of twenty thieves in Constantinople during that time. As for highway robbers, who surely had been impaled, Aubry heard of only 6 such cases during his residence there.<ref>''de La Mottraye'' [https://archive.org/details/b30457464_0002 p. 188]</ref> Staying at Aleppo from 1740\u201354, Alexander Russell notes that in the 20 years gone by, there were no more than \"half a dozen\" public executions there.<ref>''Russell'' (1794) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=331&id=7PfaAAAAMAAJ p. 331]</ref> Jean de Th\u00e9venot, traveling in the Ottoman Empire and its territories like Egypt in the late 1650s, emphasizes the ''regional'' variations in impalement frequency. Of Constantinople and Turkey, de Th\u00e9venot writes that impalement was \"not much practised\" and \"very rarely put in practice.\" An exception he highlighted was the situation of Christians in Constantinople. If a Christian spoke or acted out against the \"Law of Mahomet\", or consorted with a Turkish woman, or broke into a mosque, then he might face impalement unless he converted to Islam. In contrast, de Th\u00e9venot says that in Egypt impalement was a \"very ordinary punishment\" against the Arabs there, whereas Turks in Egypt were strangled in prison instead of being publicly executed like the natives.<ref>See ''de Th\u00e9venot''(1687), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=259&id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p.&nbsp;68\u201369] and [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=259&id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p. 259]</ref> Thus, the actual frequency of impalement within the Ottoman Empire varied greatly, not only from time to time, but also from place to place, and between different population groups in the empire.\n\nHighway robbers were still impaled into the 1830s, but one source says the practice was rare by then.<ref>Late Ottoman cases in 1830s Balkans, i) Some five case reported 1833, ''M***r'' (1833) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=440&id=Jow0AQAAMAAJ p.&nbsp;440\u201341 columns 2] ii) 1834, Two such corpses, close to the village Paracini in the vicinity of Jagodina, see: ''Burgess'' (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=275&id=hr_0VHlDUjwC p. 275] iii) Rarity of such cases in the 1830s,''[[Charles A.

In October 1767 Hassan Bey, who had preyed on Turkish ships in the [[Euxine Sea]] for a number of years, was captured and impaled, even though he had offered 500,000 ducats for his pardon.<ref>''Ranft'' (1769), [https://books.google.com/books?id=epZAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA345 p. 345]</ref>\n\n====Klephts and rebels in Greece====\nDuring the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule of Greece]], impalement became an important tool of [[psychological warfare]], intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned [[guerrilla]] insurgents (known as ''[[klepht]]s'') became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities.<ref>missing</ref> The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, and were able to enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.<ref name=\"Aiolos 2004\">[http://www.metopo.gr/article.php?id=5009 \"Aiolos (2004)\"]</ref>\n\nImpalement was, on occasion, aggravated with being set over a fire, the impaling stake acting as a [[Rotisserie|spit]], so that the impaled victim might be [[Death by burning|roasted alive]].<ref>''Dumas'' (2008), volume 8, chapter 3</ref> Among other severities, [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], an [[Albanians|Albanian]]-born Ottoman noble who ruled [[Ioannina]], had rebels, criminals, and even the descendants of those who had wronged him or his family in the past, impaled and roasted alive.

A detailed description of an execution that was carried out in this manner comes from 17th-century [[Ko\u0161ice]] (then in [[Hungary]], now in eastern [[Slovakia]]). The case of a woman who was to be executed for [[infanticide]] involved an executioner and two assistants. First, a grave some one-and-a-half [[ell]] deep was dug. The woman was then placed within it, her hands and feet were secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave on her heart in order to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth at the behest of the clerics, because to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner used a pair of tongs to grab a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and the earth moved upwards for a moment, before it was all over.<ref>''Wagner'' (1687), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJJOAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT51 p. 55] '''NOTE''': The German word \"Pfahl\" (with the associated verb \"zu pf\u00e4hlen\") refers to a ''wooden'' stake, and it is the word used in influential law texts like the 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]], so the reader should not assume that the use of a heated metal rod was standard procedure.

The [[Code of Hammurabi]], promulgated about 1772 BC<ref>[[Middle chronology]] is used here</ref> by the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Babylonian]] king [[Hammurabi]] specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man.<ref>Article 153 in: ''Harper'' (1904), [[s:The Code of Hammurabi (Harper translation)|The Code of Hammurabi]]</ref> In the late [[History of Mesopotamia#Isin-Larsa, Old Babylonian and Shamshi-Adad I|Isin/Larsa period]], from about the same time, it seems that, in some city states, mere adultery on the wife's part (without murder of her husband mentioned) could be punished by impalement.<ref>''Tetlow'' (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&pg=PA34 p. 34]</ref> From the royal archives of the city of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi, it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled.<ref>''Hamblin'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5IQQir5eFEC&pg=PA208 p. 208]</ref> Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of [[Elam]] made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates.<ref>''Herrenschmidt, Bott\u00e9ro'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wwoPiWG3-LQC&pg=PA84 p. 84]</ref> For acts of perceived great sacrilege, some individuals, in diverse cultures, have been impaled for their effrontery. For example, roughly 1200 BC, merchants of [[Ugarit]] express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town [[Sidon]], due to some \"great sin\" committed against the patron deity of Sidon.<ref>''Mayer, ed.''

For the Neo-Assyrians, mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also, it can seem, as proofs of their ''might'' that they took pride in. Neo-Assyrian King [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (r. 883\u2013859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows:<ref>''Olmstead'' (1918), p. 66</ref>{{quote|I cut off their hands, I burned them with fire, a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up, men I impaled on stakes, the city I destroyed and devastated, I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps, the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned}}\n\nPaul Kern,<ref>[http://www.iun.edu/~nwacadem/hppr/faculty/pkern.shtml Paul Kern]</ref> in his (1999) \"Ancient Siege Warfare\", provides some statistics on how different Neo-Assyrian kings from the times of Ashurnasirpal II commemorated their punishments of rebels.<ref>''Kern'' (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FBTesdgIbcsC&pg=PA68 p. 68\u201376].

The law code discovered and deciphered by Dr. Otto Schroeder<ref>''Schroeder'' (1920), [https://archive.org/details/keilschrifttexte00schr Keilschrifttexte aus Assur verschiedenen Inhalts]</ref> contains in its paragraph 51 the following injunction against abortion:<ref>''Jastrow'' (1921), p. 48\u201349</ref>\n\n{{quote|If a woman with her consent brings on a miscarriage, they seize her, and determine her guilt.

The passage explains that Haman conspired to have all the Jews in the empire killed but his plan was thwarted, and he was given the punishment he had thought to mete out to [[Mordecai]]. The English Standard Version of Esther 5:14 describes this as ''hanging'',<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Esther+5&version=ESV Book of Esther, ESV Bible edition]</ref> whereas The New International Reader's version opts for ''impalement''.<ref>[http://www.biblica.com/bibles/chapter/?verse=Esther+5&version=nirv Book of Esther, NIRV Bible edition]</ref>\nThe Assyriologist [[Paul Haupt]] opts for impalement in his 1908 essay \"Critical notes on Esther\",<ref>''Haupt'' (1908), p. 122, 152, 154, 170</ref> while Benjamin Shaw has an extended discussion of the topic on the website ligonier.org from 2012.<ref>''Shaw'' (2012), [http://www.ligonier.org/blog/was-haman-hanged-or-impaled/ Was Haman Hanged or Impaled?]</ref>\n\nOther passages in the [[Bible]] may allude to the practice of impalement, such as [[II Samuel]] 21:9 concerning the fate of the sons of [[Saul]], where some English translations use the verb \"impale\", but others use \"hang\".<ref>[https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/21-9-compare.html Compare Translations for 2 Samuel 21:9]</ref>\n\nAlthough we lack conclusive evidence either way for whether Hebrew law allowed for impalement, or for hanging (whether as a mode of execution or for display of the corpse), the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement as seen in carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of ''hanging'' upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual ''penetration'' of the body.\n\n====Rome====\n\nFrom John Granger Cook, 2014: \"''Stipes'' is Seneca's term for the object used for impalement. This narrative and his ''Ep''. 14.5 are the only two textually explicit references to impalement in Latin texts:\"\n\n{{quote|\nI see crosses there, not just of one kind but made differently by different [fabricators]; some individuals suspended their victims with heads inverted toward the ground; some drove a stake (''stipes'') through their excretory organs/genitals; others stretched out their [victims'] arms on a patibulum [cross bar]; I see racks, I see lashes ...\n\n''Video istic cruces ne unius quidem generis sed aliter ab aliis fabricatas; capite quidam conuersos in terram suspendere, alii per obscena stipitem egerunt, alii brachia patibulo explicuerunt; video fidiculas, video uerbera ...'' <ref>''Crucifixion in the Mediterranean World'' by John Granger Cook, 2014, published by Mohr Siebeck,{{ISBN|9783161531248}}</ref>}}\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Transversal impalement====\nWithin the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in article 131 of the 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]], the following punishment was stated for women found guilty of [[infanticide]]. Generally, they should be drowned, but the law code allowed for, in particularly severe cases, that the old punishment could be implemented. That is, the woman would be [[buried alive]], and then a stake would be driven through her heart.<ref name=\"Koch\">For law text, ''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Koch,_Johann_Christoph Koch]'' (1824) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_q_o6AAAAcAAJ <!-- quote=verzweiffelung. --> p. 63]</ref> Similarly, burial alive, combined with transversal impalement is attested as an early execution method for people found guilty of [[adultery]]. The 1348 statutes of [[Zwickau]] allowed punishment of an adulterous couple in the following way: They were to be placed on top of each other in a grave, with a layer of thorns between them. Then, a single stake was to be hammered through them.<ref>''Engel, Jacob'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=OP3hhD7_T6QC&pg=PA75 p. 75] A similar punishment of the couple by impalement for adultery if caught in the act is mentioned in Bavarian sources as well, see ''His'' (1928), p. 150</ref> A similar punishment by impalement for a proven male adulterer is mentioned in a 13th-century ordinance for [[Bohemia]]n mining town [[Jihlava]] (then and German [[Iglau]]),<ref>''Schwetschke'' (1789), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hytRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT351 col. 692]</ref> whereas in a 1340 Vienna statute, the husband of a woman caught [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante'']] in adultery could, if he wished to, demand that his wife and her lover be impaled, or alternatively demand a monetary restitution.<ref>''Ehrlich'' (2005), p. 42</ref> Occasionally, women found guilty of [[witchcraft]] have been condemned to be impaled. In 1587 [[Kiel]], 101-year-old Sunde Bohlen was, on being condemned as a witch, buried alive, and afterwards had a stake driven through her heart.<ref>''Fick'' (1867), [https://books.google.com/books?id=b8JCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>\n\nRapists of [[virgins]] and children are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was to be placed in an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure.<ref>''Engelmann'' (1834)[https://books.google.com/books?jtp=158&id=KOAAAAAAcAAJ p. 158]</ref> Serving as an example of the fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.<ref>''[[:de:Eduard Osenbr\u00fcggen|Osenbr\u00fcggen]]'' (1868), [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YWE7AAAAcAAJ/page/n311 p. 297]</ref>\n\n====Longitudinal impalement====\nCases of ''longitudinal'' impalement typically occur in the context of war or as a punishment for [[robbery]], the latter being attested to as the practice in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nIndividuals accused of collaborating with the enemy have, on occasion, been impaled. In 1632 during the [[Thirty Years' War]], the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of [[defecting]] to the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]],<ref>Schwab (1827), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ubmr9w0g9GAC&pg=PA256 p. 256]</ref> a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans.<ref>''Gottfried, van Hulsius'' (1633), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HItOAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA462 p. 462]</ref> In 1654, under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Cretan War (1645\u201369)|siege]] of the [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] garrison at [[Crete]], several peasants were impaled for supplying provisions to the besieged.<ref>''Han'' (1669), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KlZBAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA2-PT55 p. 203]</ref> Likewise in 1685, some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided supplies to the Turks.<ref>''Beer'' (1713), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UT5VAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA127 p. 127]</ref>\n\nIn 1677, a particularly brutal German General Kops leading the forces of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] who wanted to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than allow it to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and [[Dismemberment|quartering]] his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general on the Hungarian side, {{ill|Wessel\u00e9nyi P\u00e1l|lt=Wessel\u00e9nyi|hu}}, responded in kind, by [[flaying]] alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I had enough of the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities.<ref>''von Loen'' (1751), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA420 p. 420\u2013422]</ref> After the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)]], [[Sicily]] fell under [[Habsburg]] rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming that a whole eight days had gone by since he had last killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled.<ref>''von Imhoff'' (1736), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLb5cjzNpz4C&pg=PA1051 p. 1051]</ref> In the short-lived 1784 [[Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an|Horea Revolt]] against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers, whom they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of [[Vasile Ursu Nicola|Horea]]'s 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.<ref>''Mannheimer Zeitung'' (1784), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1BpEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA631 p. 638]</ref> After the revolt was crushed by early 1785, some 150 rebels are said to have been impaled.<ref>''Vehse, Demmler'' (1856), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZVHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA318 p. 318]</ref>\n\nFrom 1748 onwards, German regiments organized manhunts on \"robbers\" in Hungary/Croatia, impaling those who were caught.<ref>''Woltersdorf'' (1812)[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6aBOAAAAcAAJ p. 267]</ref>\n\n==== Heinous murderers ====\nOccasionally, individual murderers were perceived to have been so heinous that standard punishments like [[Decapitation|beheading]] or being [[Breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] were regarded as incommensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. An example is that of Pavel Va\u0161ansk\u00fd (Paul Wasansky in German transcript), who was executed on 1 March 1570 in [[Ivan\u010dice]] in present-day Czech Republic, on account of 124 confessed murders (he was a roaming highwayman). He underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: first, his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers; he was then flayed, impaled and finally roasted alive.

He dealt harshly with his enemies, especially those who had betrayed his family in the past, or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia. Though a [[Vlad III the Impaler#Methods of execution|variety of methods]] were employed, he has been most associated with his use of impalement. The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers, members of a rival clan,<ref name=vlad/> and criminals in his domain, whether they were members of the [[boyar]] nobility or peasants, and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him. Following the multiple campaigns against the invading [[Ottoman Turks]], Vlad would never show mercy to his [[prisoners of war]]. After [[The Night Attack]] of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219 in mid-June 1462 failed to assassinate the Ottoman sultan, the road to [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], the capital of Vlad's [[principality]] of Wallachia, eventually became inundated in a \"forest\" of 20,000 impaled and decaying corpses, and it is reported that [[Mehmet II]]'s invading army of Turks turned back to Constantinople in 1462 after encountering thousands of impaled corpses along the [[Danube River]].<ref name=vlad>{{Citation | last= Axinte|title= Dracula: Between myth and reality |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/rsa/_content/_public/_htm/dracula.shtml}}</ref> [[Woodcut|Woodblock]] prints from the era portray his victims impaled from either the [[anterior|frontal]] or the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] aspect, but not vertically.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nLongitudinal impalement is an execution method often attested within the Ottoman Empire, for a variety of offenses, it was done mostly as a warning to others or to terrify.<ref name=\"Reid2000\">{{cite book|author=James J.

One Venetian captain, Antonio Rizzo, sought to defy the ban, but his ship was hit by a cannonball. He and his crew were picked up from the waters, the crew members to be beheaded (or [[Death by sawing|sawn asunder]] according to [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]]<ref>''Philippides, Hanak'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qvvdVXckfqQC&pg=PA587 p. 587]</ref>), whereas Rizzo was impaled.<ref>''Runciman'' (1965), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAzntP0lg58C&pg=PA67 p. 67]</ref> In the early days of the siege in May 1453, contingents of the Ottoman army made mop-up operations at minor fortifications like [[Therapia]] and Studium.

For some periods at least, executions for civil crimes were claimed to have been rather rare in the Ottoman Empire. [[:sv:Aubry de La Motraye|Aubry de La Motraye]] lived in the realm for 14 years from 1699 to 1713 and claimed that he had not heard of twenty thieves in Constantinople during that time. As for highway robbers, who surely had been impaled, Aubry heard of only 6 such cases during his residence there.<ref>''de La Mottraye'' [https://archive.org/details/b30457464_0002 p. 188]</ref> Staying at Aleppo from 1740\u201354, Alexander Russell notes that in the 20 years gone by, there were no more than \"half a dozen\" public executions there.<ref>''Russell'' (1794) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=331&id=7PfaAAAAMAAJ p. 331]</ref> Jean de Th\u00e9venot, traveling in the Ottoman Empire and its territories like Egypt in the late 1650s, emphasizes the ''regional'' variations in impalement frequency. Of Constantinople and Turkey, de Th\u00e9venot writes that impalement was \"not much practised\" and \"very rarely put in practice.\" An exception he highlighted was the situation of Christians in Constantinople. If a Christian spoke or acted out against the \"Law of Mahomet\", or consorted with a Turkish woman, or broke into a mosque, then he might face impalement unless he converted to Islam. In contrast, de Th\u00e9venot says that in Egypt impalement was a \"very ordinary punishment\" against the Arabs there, whereas Turks in Egypt were strangled in prison instead of being publicly executed like the natives.<ref>See ''de Th\u00e9venot''(1687), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=259&id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p.&nbsp;68\u201369] and [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=259&id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p. 259]</ref> Thus, the actual frequency of impalement within the Ottoman Empire varied greatly, not only from time to time, but also from place to place, and between different population groups in the empire.\n\nHighway robbers were still impaled into the 1830s, but one source says the practice was rare by then.<ref>Late Ottoman cases in 1830s Balkans, i) Some five case reported 1833, ''M***r'' (1833) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=440&id=Jow0AQAAMAAJ p.&nbsp;440\u201341 columns 2] ii) 1834, Two such corpses, close to the village Paracini in the vicinity of Jagodina, see: ''Burgess'' (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=275&id=hr_0VHlDUjwC p. 275] iii) Rarity of such cases in the 1830s,''[[Charles A.

In October 1767 Hassan Bey, who had preyed on Turkish ships in the [[Euxine Sea]] for a number of years, was captured and impaled, even though he had offered 500,000 ducats for his pardon.<ref>''Ranft'' (1769), [https://books.google.com/books?id=epZAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA345 p. 345]</ref>\n\n====Klephts and rebels in Greece====\nDuring the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule of Greece]], impalement became an important tool of [[psychological warfare]], intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned [[guerrilla]] insurgents (known as ''[[klepht]]s'') became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities.<ref>missing</ref> The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, and were able to enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.<ref name=\"Aiolos 2004\">[http://www.metopo.gr/article.php?id=5009 \"Aiolos (2004)\"]</ref>\n\nImpalement was, on occasion, aggravated with being set over a fire, the impaling stake acting as a [[Rotisserie|spit]], so that the impaled victim might be [[Death by burning|roasted alive]].<ref>''Dumas'' (2008), volume 8, chapter 3</ref> Among other severities, [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], an [[Albanians|Albanian]]-born Ottoman noble who ruled [[Ioannina]], had rebels, criminals, and even the descendants of those who had wronged him or his family in the past, impaled and roasted alive.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt and Cotillard's performances, in addition to its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt and Cotillard's performances, in addition to its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Alberta]] to raise Anna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

Her participation in the rescue of survivors from the shipwrecked [[Forfarshire (ship)|''Forfarshire'']] in 1838 brought her national fame. The [[paddlesteamer]] ran aground on the [[Farne Islands]] off the coast of [[Northumberland]] in northeast England; nine members of her crew were saved.\n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Lighthouse LongStone with Grace Darlings Bedroom WindowFarne Islands Northumberland.JPG|thumb|left|Lighthouse at Longstone. The upper window in the white ring was Grace Darling's bedroom, from which she saw the wreckage of the ''Forfarshire''.]]\n\nGrace Darling was born on 24 November 1815 at her grandfather's home in Northumberland. She was the seventh of nine children (four brothers and four sisters) born to William and Thomasin Darling, and when only a few weeks old she was taken to live on [[Brownsman Island]], one of the Farne Islands, in a small cottage attached to the lighthouse.

The family spent most of their time on the ground floor of the lighthouse which consisted of a large room, heated by a wood stove.  The room was their living room, dining room and kitchen in one and had a spiral staircase leading to three bedrooms above and the light at the top of the tower.<ref>http://www.farne.co.uk/grace_horsley_darling.html</ref>\n\nIn the early hours of 7 September 1838, Darling, looking from an upstairs window, spotted the wreck and survivors of the ''Forfarshire'' on Big Harcar, a nearby low rocky island. The ''Forfarshire'' had foundered on the rocks and broken in half: one of the halves had sunk during the night.\n[[File:Grace Darling Forfarshire Thomas Musgrave Joy.jpg|thumb|right|260px|''Grace Darling at the Forfarshire'' by [[Thomas Musgrave Joy]].]]\n\nShe and her father William determined that the weather was too rough for the [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] to put out from [[Seahouses]] (then [[North Sunderland]]), so they took a [[rowing boat]] (a {{Convert|21|ft||abbr=on|adj=on}}, 4-man Northumberland [[coble]]) across to the survivors, taking a long route that kept to the lee side of the islands, a distance of nearly a mile (about {{Convert|1|mi||abbr=on|disp=out|round=0.5}}). Darling kept the coble steady in the water while her father helped four men and the lone surviving woman, Sarah Dawson, into the boat. Although she survived the sinking, Mrs. Dawson had lost her two young children (James, 7, and Matilda, 5) during the night.<ref>[http://www.gracedarling.co.uk/Casualties.html List of Casualties of SS Forfarshire, 7 September 1838]</ref> William and three of the rescued men then rowed the boat back to the lighthouse. Darling then remained at the lighthouse while William and three of the rescued crew members rowed back and recovered four more survivors.\n\nMeanwhile, the lifeboat had set out from Seahouses but arrived at Big Harcar rock after Darling and her father had completed their rescue operation: all they found were the bodies of Mrs. Dawson's children and of a clergyman. It was too dangerous to return to North Sunderland so they rowed to the lighthouse to take shelter. Darling's brother, William Brooks Darling, was one of the seven fishermen in the lifeboat. The weather deteriorated to the extent that everyone was obliged to remain at the lighthouse for three days before returning to shore.\n\nThe ''Forfarshire'' had been carrying 62 people. The vessel broke in two almost immediately upon hitting the rocks. Those rescued by Darling and her father were from the bow section of the vessel which had been held by the rocks for some time before sinking. All that remained at daybreak was the portside paddlebox casing. Nine other passengers and crew had managed to float off a lifeboat from the stern section before it too sank, and were picked up in the night by a passing [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] [[sloop]] and brought into [[South Shields]] that same night.<ref name=\"The Junior Classics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Junior-Classics7.html |title=The Junior Classics \u2013 Volume 7, Stories of Courage and Heroism  |author=William Patten |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAs news of her role in the rescue reached the public, her combination of bravery and simple virtue set her out as exemplary, and led to an uneasy role as the nation's heroine.
