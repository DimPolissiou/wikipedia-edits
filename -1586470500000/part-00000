No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade.

Equally problematic, the model is not designed to assess the effect on trade from trade agreements \u2013 in fact, the model is profoundly ill suited for such an exercise. No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade. The reason is simple: if a model cannot predict the effects on the flows and profile of trade as a consequence of trade liberalisation, it is of no use at all.\"<ref name=\":30\"/> They add, \"In Capaldo\u2019s analysis, structural change and the emergence of new industries do not play a role at all. Capaldo implicitly assumes that an economy with its labour and capital does not respond and adjust to new circumstances. New competition only leads to new unemployment.

Busch and [[McGill University]] Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]], such as different standards and regulations, in addition to [[tariff]]s. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to  [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore; however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by M\u0101ori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapo were also occasionally kept as pets.\n\nThe kakapo is critically endangered; the total known adult population is {{Number_of_Living_Kakapo}}<!-- see link on talk page for editing this number --> [[List of kakapo|living individuals]], all of which are named and tagged, confined to four small islands off the coast of New Zealand that have been cleared of predators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/26/world/kakapo-conservation-scn-c2e-intl-hnk/index.html|title=Can tech save New Zealand's 'gorgeous, hilarious' parrot?|first=Sarah |last=Lazarus|website=CNN|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref> The [[Invasive species in New Zealand|introduction of predators]] such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats during British colonisation  almost wiped out the kakapo.

Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity \u2013 museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''habroptilus''. The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the \"owl parrot\". The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble [[whiskers|vibrissae]] or \"whiskers\"; it is possible kakapo use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [[dactyly|zygodactyl]] (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n[[File:K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d head.jpg|thumb|left|The \"whiskers\" around the beak.]]\nFemales are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller [[Beak#Cere|cere]] and [[Beak#Nares|nostrils]], more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a [[brood patch]] of bare skin on the belly.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe kakapo's [[Altriciality|altricial]] young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green colouration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resemble eyelashes.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\" />\n\nLike many other parrots, kakapo have a variety of calls. As well as the ''booms'' (see [[Kakapo#Media|below]] for a recording) and ''chings'' of their mating calls, they will often loudly ''skraark''.<ref name=\"CloseUp\"/>\n\nThe kakapo has a well-developed [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], which complements its nocturnal lifestyle.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Hagelin | first1 = Julie C.\n| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00212.x\n| title = Observations on the olfactory ability of the kakapo ''Strigops habroptilus'', the critically endangered parrot of New Zealand\n| journal = [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]\n| volume = 146\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 161\u2013164\n|date=January 2004\n}}</ref> It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\"/> The kakapo has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\" /> One of the most striking characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour.<ref name=\"CloseUp\">{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/up-close-and-personal/|title=Up Close & Personal|publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref> The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildinfo.net/facts/Kakapo.asp?page=/facts/Kakapo.asp|title=Kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'')|publisher=Wild Magazine}}</ref>\n\nAs a nocturnal species, the kakapo has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its [[optic tectum]], [[nucleus rotundus]], and [[Avian pallium|entopallium]] are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight. These modifications allow the kakapo to have enhanced light sensitivity but with poor visual acuity.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1=Corfield | first1=J. R.\n| last2=Gsell | first2=A.

Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, [[vestigial]] keel and a shortened [[spina externa]]. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the [[furcula]] is not fused but consists of a pair of [[clavicles]] lying in contact with each [[coracoid]]. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.<ref name=\"Livezey1992\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Livezey | first1 = Bradley C.\n| doi = 10.1002/jmor.1052130108\n| pmid = 29865598\n| title = Morphological corollaries and ecological implications of flightlessness in the kakapo (Psittaciformes: ''Strigops habroptilus'')\n| journal = Journal of Morphology\n| volume = 213\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 105\u2013145\n|date=July 1992\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] musculature of the kakapo is also modified by flightlessness. The [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis]] and [[supracoracoideus]] muscles are greatly reduced. The [[propatagialis tendo longus]] has no distinct muscle belly. The [[sternocoracoideus]] is tendinous. There is an extensive [[cucularis capitis clavicularis]] muscle that is associated with the large crop.<ref name=\"Livezey1992\"/>\n\n===Genetics===\nBecause kakapo passed through a [[Population_bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]], in which the world population was reduced to 49 birds, they are extremely inbred and have low genetic diversity.

It can also \"parachute\" \u2013 descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/> With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kakapo cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kakapo is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. When foraging, kakapo tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called \"browse signs\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHaving lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs.

As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6&nbsp;months.\n\nBecause the kakapo is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 60 (plus or minus 20) years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding.<ref name=\":2\" /> Males start booming at about 5&nbsp;years of age.<ref name=\"Higgins1999\"/> It was thought that females reached [[sexual maturity]] at 9 years of age, but four five-year-old females have now been recorded reproducing.<ref name=\"Easton2006\"/><ref name=\":2\" /> The kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. [[Dacrydium cupressinum|Rimu]] mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests, such as those on Whenua Hou, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nutrient composition of the diet of parent-raised kakapo nestlings |first1=Yvette |last1=Cottam |first2=Don V. |last2=Merton  |authorlink2=Don Merton |first3=Wouter |last3=Hendriks |pages=90\u201399|journal=Notornis |volume=53 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_90.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect of the kakapo's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female in good condition produces more male offspring (males have 30%\u201340% more body weight than females<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females.<ref name=\"berkeley_kakapo_reproduction\">{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/060401_kakapo |title=Conserving the kakapo |accessdate=22 March 2008 |date=April 2006 |work=Understanding Evolution |publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}</ref> This supports the [[Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis]].

For this reason, the kakapo has a very small [[gizzard]] compared to other birds of their size. It is entirely [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food.<ref name=\"Best1984\"/> It is particularly fond of the fruit of the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]] tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo strips out the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Gray |first=R.

Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kakapo was caught and released in the [[Milford Sound]] catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [[aviary|aviaries]] of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [[Masterton]] in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years.

At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming.

This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened \"Richard Henry\", and transferred to [[Maud Island]]. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [[glaciated valley]]s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nBefore 1977, no expedition had been to [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]] to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on [[Stewart Island]].<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/> An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified [[scrubland]] and forest raised hope that the population would include females.

Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to  [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore; however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by M\u0101ori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapo were also occasionally kept as pets.\n\nThe kakapo is critically endangered; the total known adult population is {{Number_of_Living_Kakapo}}<!-- see link on talk page for editing this number --> [[List of kakapo|living individuals]], all of which are named and tagged, confined to four small islands off the coast of New Zealand that have been cleared of predators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/26/world/kakapo-conservation-scn-c2e-intl-hnk/index.html|title=Can tech save New Zealand's 'gorgeous, hilarious' parrot?|first=Sarah |last=Lazarus|website=CNN|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref> The [[Invasive species in New Zealand|introduction of predators]] such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats during British colonisation  almost wiped out the kakapo. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Programme in 1995.\n\nMost kakapo are kept on two predator-free islands, [[Codfish Island|Codfish / Whenua Hou]] and [[Anchor Island|Anchor]], where they are closely monitored, and [[Little Barrier Island|Little Barrier / Hauturu Island]] is being trialled as a third home for the species.\n\n==Taxonomy, systematics and naming==\n[[File:Kakapo2.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of a kakapo from the book ''A History of the Birds of New Zealand'' by Walter Lawry Buller, published in 1873.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kakapo.html |title=New Zealand Birds &#124; Birds &#124; Gallery &#124; Kakapo, ''Strigops habroptilus'' |publisher=Nzbirds.com |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref>]]\nThe common English name \"kakapo\" comes from the [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] \"k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d\", from ''k\u0101k\u0101'' (\"parrot\") + ''p\u014d'' (\"night\"); the name is both singular and plural. \"K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d\" is increasingly written in New Zealand English with the [[Macron (diacritic)|macrons]] that indicate long vowels.\n\nThe kakapo was originally described by English [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] [[George Robert Gray]] in 1845 and named ''Strigops habroptilus''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Some sources give the kakapo's Latin name as ''Strigops habroptila'', from the belief that the word ''Strigops'' is feminine, and the species name is required to agree in gender; neither of which is true \u2013 ''Strigops'' is a masculine compound, and ''habroptilus'' is a noun in apposition, not an adjective.

Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity \u2013 museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''habroptilus''. The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the \"owl parrot\". The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble [[whiskers|vibrissae]] or \"whiskers\"; it is possible kakapo use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [[dactyly|zygodactyl]] (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n[[File:K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d head.jpg|thumb|left|The \"whiskers\" around the beak.]]\nFemales are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller [[Beak#Cere|cere]] and [[Beak#Nares|nostrils]], more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a [[brood patch]] of bare skin on the belly.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nThe kakapo's [[Altriciality|altricial]] young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green colouration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resemble eyelashes.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\" />\n\nLike many other parrots, kakapo have a variety of calls. As well as the ''booms'' (see [[Kakapo#Media|below]] for a recording) and ''chings'' of their mating calls, they will often loudly ''skraark''.<ref name=\"CloseUp\"/>\n\nThe kakapo has a well-developed [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], which complements its nocturnal lifestyle.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Hagelin | first1 = Julie C.\n| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00212.x\n| title = Observations on the olfactory ability of the kakapo ''Strigops habroptilus'', the critically endangered parrot of New Zealand\n| journal = [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]\n| volume = 146\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 161\u2013164\n|date=January 2004\n}}</ref> It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\"/> The kakapo has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots.<ref name=\"Hagelin04\" /> One of the most striking characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour.<ref name=\"CloseUp\">{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/up-close-and-personal/|title=Up Close & Personal|publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref> The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildinfo.net/facts/Kakapo.asp?page=/facts/Kakapo.asp|title=Kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'')|publisher=Wild Magazine}}</ref>\n\nAs a nocturnal species, the kakapo has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its [[optic tectum]], [[nucleus rotundus]], and [[Avian pallium|entopallium]] are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight.

Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, [[vestigial]] keel and a shortened [[spina externa]].

Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful.

Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the [[Whanganui River]] as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the [[Kaimanawa Range]]s by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.<ref name=\"FLM\"/>\n\n===Early protection efforts===\nIn 1891, the New Zealand government set aside [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]] in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed [[Richard Treacy Henry|Richard Henry]] as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and [[kiwi]] from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200&nbsp;kakapo to Resolution Island.

Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kakapo was caught and released in the [[Milford Sound]] catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [[aviary|aviaries]] of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [[Masterton]] in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12&nbsp;years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Donald |first1=Paul F. |last2=Collar |first2=Nigel J.|last3=Marsden |first3=Stuart J. |last4=Pain |first4=Deborah J. |title=Facing Extinction: The World's Rarest Birds and the Race to Save Them |year=2010 |publisher=T & A D Poyser |location=London |isbn=978-0-7136-7021-9 |p=167}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming. These observations led [[Don Merton]] to speculate for the first time that the kakapo had a [[Lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system.<ref name=\"Merton77\"/> From 1974 to 1978 a total of 18&nbsp;kakapo were discovered in Fiordland, but all were males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened \"Richard Henry\", and transferred to [[Maud Island]]. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [[glaciated valley]]s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/>\n\nBefore 1977, no expedition had been to [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]] to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on [[Stewart Island]].<ref name=\"Powlesland2006\"/> An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified [[scrubland]] and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200&nbsp;birds.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9518039 |last1=Powlesland |first1=R.G. |last2=Roberts|first2=A. |last3=Lloyd |first3=B.D. |last4=Merton |first4=D.V. |authorlink4=Don Merton |year=1995 |title=Number, fate and distribution of kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') found on Stewart Island, New Zealand, 1979\u201392 |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013248}}</ref>\n\n[[Mustelid]]s have never colonised [[Stewart Island|Stewart Island/Rakiura]], but feral cats were present.

Before [[Polynesian rat]]s were removed from Whenua Hou, they were a threat to the survival of young kakapo. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats.<ref name=\"Elliott2001\" /> Nest protection was intensified after 1995 by using [[rat trap|traps]] and poison stations as soon as a nest was detected. A small video camera and [[Infrared|infra-red light source]] would watch the nest continuously, and scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds.\n\nAll kakapo islands are now rat-free, but infrared cameras still allow rangers to remotely monitor the behaviour of females and chicks in nests. Data loggers record when mother kakapo come and go, allowing rangers to pick a time to check on the health of chicks, and also indicate how hard females are having to work to find food. Because mother kakapo often struggle to successfully rear multiple chicks, Kakapo Recovery rangers will move chicks between nests as needed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEggs are often removed from nests for incubation to reduce the likelihood of accidents, such as lost eggs or crushing.

The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or \"[[Mast year|masting]]\" events of particular plant species such as the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]], which led M\u0101ori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future.<ref name=\"MBL\">{{cite book |first=Murdoch |last=Riley |title=Maori Bird Lore; An introduction |publisher=Viking Sevenseas NZ LTD. |year=2001}}</ref> Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the [[Elaeocarpus dentatus|hinau]] and [[Tawa (tree)|tawa]] trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the M\u0101ori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.<ref name=\"MBL\"/>\n\n===Use for food and clothing===\n[[File:Strigops habroptilus (AM LB14666-3).jpg|thumb|upright|Feathers]] \nThe meat of kakapo made good eating and was considered by M\u0101ori to be a delicacy<ref name=\"Tipa2006\"/> and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread.<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book |first1=Rod |last1=Morris |first2=Hal |last2=Smith |title=Wild South: Saving New Zealand's endangered birds |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand |year=1995}}</ref> One source states that its flesh \"resembles [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in taste and texture\",<ref name=\"MBL\"/> although European settlers have described the bird as having a \"strong and slightly stringent [sic] flavour\".<ref name=\"Tipa2006\"/>\n\nIn breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their [[Lek (mating arena)|mating arenas]] made it easy for M\u0101ori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates,but who is nonetheless loved and accepted as a gimp and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board ''Red Dwarf'' is a creature called \"[[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]]\" ([[Danny John-Jules]]), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.<ref name=\"the end\">{{Cite episode |title=The End |episode-link=The End (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=15 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of \"[[Future Echoes]]\" (1988), Rimmer claims to have taken the \"astronavigation exam\" without passing nine times, or \"[t]en, if you count the time [he] had [his] spasm.\" He also claims in this episode that his father had said, \"Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut, and you can cope with anything,\" right before \"that unfortunate [[suicide]] business\".<ref name=\"future echoes\">{{Cite episode |title=Future Echoes |episode-link=Future Echoes |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=22 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Balance of Power (Red Dwarf)|Balance of Power]]\" (1988), Holly reveals that reason Rimmer was brought back as a hologram was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, the fact that their interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant. Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.<ref name=\"confidence\">{{Cite episode |title=Confidence and Paranoia |episode-link=Confidence and Paranoia |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Me\u00b2]]\" (1988), Rimmer is shown moving in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]]. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5\" by the time he was eleven. Rimmer disliked his parents enough to the point where he [[divorce]]d them from himself when he was fourteen; Rimmer getting paid [[Alimony|maintenance]] until employment age and access to the family dog every fourth weekend.<ref name=\"better than life episode\"/>\n\nAccording to \"[[Thanks for the Memory (Red Dwarf)|Thanks for the Memory]]\" (1988), Rimmer did a maintenance course at Saturn Tech.

He explains that when he was fifteen, he had a \"friend\", Porky Roebuck, to whom Rimmer believed that Porky's father having an affair with Rimmer's mother proved how close he and Porky were. Porky and Rimmer went on a Space Scouts survival course together, where Porky was the ringleader of a plan to eat Rimmer; Rimmer being tied to a stake and having [[barbecue sauce]] poured on him before he was almost cooked.

Regarding Rimmer as little more than a \"discardable sex object\", the female Rimmer sexually harasses and gropes Rimmer and tries to [[Hypnosis|hypnotise]] him even after Rimmer shows no interest.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Parallel Universe |episode-link=Parallel Universe (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=11 October 1988 |season= |series-no=II |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Backwards (Red Dwarf episode)|Backwards]]\" (1989), Rimmer facilitates a driving test for the mechanoid [[Kryten]] ([[Robert Llewellyn]]), where Kryten causes the ''Starbug 1'' shuttle to fall into a time hole. The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and Holly (now played by [[Hattie Hayridge]]) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten start working as the novelty act \"the Sensational Reverse Brothers\" and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but after three weeks, they are fired by a pub manager ([[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten only become involved in later that night.

In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\".

Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment.

Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair<ref name=\"the inquisitor\"/> relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man.<ref name=\"future echoes\"/> When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that \"every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts\" (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).<ref name=\"emohawk\"/>\n\nRimmer's Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers.

Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything.

Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]].

Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]].

After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding [[peer pressure]]. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board ''Blue Midget'' being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\".

Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

When ''Red Dwarf'' encounters a holoship with an all-hologram crew composed of the \"best and brightest\" in the episode \"[[Holoship]]\" (1991), Rimmer desperately wants to join. A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, played by [[Jane Horrocks]], falls in love with him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her.

In \"[[Polymorph (Red Dwarf)|Polymorph]]\" (1989), Rimmer leads Kryten and Cat in the hunt for the intruder and in \"[[Bodyswap]]\" (1989), he takes charge of the hunt for ''Red Dwarf's'' self-destruct mechanism. Once Rimmer is sapped of his anger by the Polymorph, he is a conciliatory pacifist wishing to promote peace between the creature and various members of the crew and keen to not hurt anybody's feelings during their discussions.<ref name=\"polymorph\"/> In \"[[Backwards (Red Dwarf)|Backwards]]\" (1989), he revels in his success as a showbiz performer and extols the virtues of a world without war, famine, crime or death. In \"[[Tikka to Ride]]\" (1997), Rimmer protests against abusing the Time Drive and chastises Lister for doing so.\n\n==Appearance==\nRimmer's status as a hologram in most episodes of ''Red Dwarf'' is shown by the 'H' on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], such as \"alphabet head\" and \"[[Goal (sport)#Rugby football|goalpost]] head\". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair<ref name=\"the inquisitor\"/> relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man.<ref name=\"future echoes\"/> When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that \"every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts\" (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).<ref name=\"emohawk\"/>\n\nRimmer's Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special ''Back to Earth'', Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the addition of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a quilted collar.<ref name=\"back to earth\"/> From [[Red Dwarf X|Series X]] onward, Rimmer sports a dark blue tunic; lacking the belt and light blue boots of the ''Back to Earth'' outfit.<ref name=\"Naylor\"/>\n\nThe 'H' on his forehead also changes from series to series: it starts as a grey colour and a blocky shape, then, in Series III, it becomes bright blue and reflective, and then, in Series V, its shape is changed to a thinner and more stylised font. His 'H' also briefly changes to a reflective red colour set inside a circle when he temporarily joins the holoship SS ''Enlightenment''.<ref name=\"holoship\"/>\n\n==Casting==\n[[Image:Arlene Rimmer.jpg|thumb|right|Rimmer encounters his \"female opposite\" Arlene.]]\n\nAmong the actors who auditioned for Rimmer were [[Norman Lovett]] (who went on to play [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] instead), [[David Baddiel]], [[Hugh Laurie]], and [[Alfred Molina]].<ref name=\"Casting\">{{cite web |url= http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=1&subsectionID=casting |title=RedDwarf.co.uk: Series I Casting |accessdate=10 December 2007}}</ref> Initially Molina was cast as Rimmer,<ref name=\"Interview: Norman Lovett\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=November 1992 |title=Interview: Norman Lovett |url= |journal=Red Dwarf Smegazine |publisher=Fleetway Editions Ltd |volume= |issue=#9 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |issn=0965-5603}}</ref><ref name=\"Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End |url= |journal=Red Dwarf Smegazine |publisher=Fleetway Editions Ltd |volume=2 |issue=#1 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |issn=0965-5603}}</ref> however, the role was recast and filled by [[Chris Barrie]], a professional voice-actor and impressionist.

A detective in the small town has hired Inspector Butterfield, a bumbling expert from England, to be his assistant in the investigation of the 27 murders. While walking down the sidewalk, Steve is approached by a couple on a motorcycle and asks them to come to church with him. They laugh and try to rob him at knife point, but he suddenly transforms into a vampire, and [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] them to drive off a cliff. At the police station, Butterfield explains how he had tracked down and defeated [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] with a wooden stake and that these murders fit the same profile, but the detective tells him to stop talking and get to work. The two meet for a drink with Steve, who turns out to be the detective's best friend and has always loved eating peanuts without shelling them.\n\nSteve finds out that his father, the preacher, has a worsening heart condition and can no longer give Steve the monthly [[blood transfusion]]s he needs to survive. There is a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] showing that Steve's mother died giving birth, a doctor diagnosed the baby with a blood disease, and the mother's best friend Amy mysteriously disappeared. As Steve and his father are driving, Steve starts acting strange and the preacher asks if he's feeling okay. Steve pulls over and runs away to puke. The preacher tries to run after him, but has a heart attack and falls to the ground. Deeper in the woods, Steve sees a young couple kissing, and murders them both. Steve finds his father lying on the ground, and the preacher manages to give him a letter from Amy before passing away.\n\nWhen the detectives show up, Butterfield finds the other two bodies in the woods and tries to question Steve, but the detective won't allow him to interrogate his best friend. Before leaving the crime scene, Butterfield looks closely for evidence.\n\nSteve follows the letter's instructions to Amy's house, where he's greeted by her servant Zork who has no hands. She explains to Steve that she was there at his birth, and knows that his mother had been bitten by Dracula while she was pregnant. She has a magical ring which disappears each time Steve transforms into a vampire and reappears when he returns to normal. Zork hypnotizes Steve, and Amy tells him that he must go to the museum where Dracula is buried.\n\nIn a deep cavern below the museum, he finds Dracula inside a coffin, with a stake in his heart. He removes the stake, and Dracula comes back to life, as well as Steve's mother. Dracula tries to hypnotize Steve, but he manages to kill Dracula. At that instant, Dracula and the mother vanish into smoke.\n\nSteve gives a sermon for his father, but cringes when he sees a girl accidentally prick her finger in one of the pews. After the funeral, Butterfield arrests Steve, explaining that he found peanut shells in the vomit near the most recent crime scene, and citing the fact that Steve cringed in response to the finger pricking. Steve asks for a few minutes to pray before going to jail, and he gives a rousing prayer to God asking for forgiveness. He touches the magic ring to a [[crucifix]], which kills Amy and replaces Zork's hands.
