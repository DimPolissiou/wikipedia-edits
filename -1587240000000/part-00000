The organizational framework supporting Spotify's software development is extensive, grouping their employees first into \"tribes\", which are composed of between 30 and 200 engineers each, with a clear mission, set of principles and a senior leader. Within each tribe are smaller groups called squads and chapters: squads are meant to feel like mini start-ups facilitating creativity by including cross-functional roles, whereas chapters share the same manager and are meant to be focused on personal growth and skills development by discussing shared challenges. Bridging these groups is a concept called a \"guild\", which is made up of employees with similar skills and interests, hoping to share their coding experiences and knowledge. Guilds are different from the other groups in that they are voluntary and not restricted to each geographical office whereas the others are physically separate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smite |first1=Darja |last2=Moe |first2=Nils Brede |last3=Levinta |first3=Georgiana |last4=Floryan |first4=Marcin |title=Spotify Guilds: How to Succeed With Knowledge Sharing in Large-Scale Agile Organizations |journal=IEEE Software |date=21 February 2019 |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=51\u201357 |doi=10.1109/MS.2018.2886178 |issn=0740-7459|hdl=11250/2640192 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>\n\n== Business model ==\nSpotify operates under a [[freemium]] business model (basic services are free, while additional features are offered via paid subscriptions). Spotify generates revenues by selling premium streaming subscriptions to users and advertising placements to third parties.\n\nIn December 2013, the company launched a new website, \"Spotify for Artists\", that explained its business model and revenue data. Spotify gets its content from major record labels as well as [[independent artist]]s, and pays [[copyright]] holders [[royalties]] for streamed music. The company pays 70% of its total revenue to rights holders. Spotify for Artists states that the company does not have a fixed per-play rate, instead it considers factors such as the user's home country and the individual artist's royalty rate.

sold, Spotify pays royalties based on their \"market share\"\u2014the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service.

The organizational framework supporting Spotify's software development is extensive, grouping their employees first into \"tribes\", which are composed of between 30 and 200 engineers each, with a clear mission, set of principles and a senior leader. Within each tribe are smaller groups called squads and chapters: squads are meant to feel like mini start-ups facilitating creativity by including cross-functional roles, whereas chapters share the same manager and are meant to be focused on personal growth and skills development by discussing shared challenges. Bridging these groups is a concept called a \"guild\", which is made up of employees with similar skills and interests, hoping to share their coding experiences and knowledge. Guilds are different from the other groups in that they are voluntary and not restricted to each geographical office whereas the others are physically separate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smite |first1=Darja |last2=Moe |first2=Nils Brede |last3=Levinta |first3=Georgiana |last4=Floryan |first4=Marcin |title=Spotify Guilds: How to Succeed With Knowledge Sharing in Large-Scale Agile Organizations |journal=IEEE Software |date=21 February 2019 |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=51\u201357 |doi=10.1109/MS.2018.2886178 |issn=0740-7459|hdl=11250/2640192 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>\n\n== Business model ==\nSpotify operates under a [[freemium]] business model (basic services are free, while additional features are offered via paid subscriptions). Spotify generates revenues by selling premium streaming subscriptions to users and advertising placements to third parties.\n\nIn December 2013, the company launched a new website, \"Spotify for Artists\", that explained its business model and revenue data. Spotify gets its content from major record labels as well as [[independent artist]]s, and pays [[copyright]] holders [[royalties]] for streamed music. The company pays 70% of its total revenue to rights holders. Spotify for Artists states that the company does not have a fixed per-play rate, instead it considers factors such as the user's home country and the individual artist's royalty rate. Rightsholders received an average per-play payout between $.006 and $.0084.<ref name=\"Spotify business\">{{cite web |title=How is Spotify contributing to the music business? |url=http://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/ |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141103193456/http://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/ |publisher=Spotify |archivedate=3 November 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nSpotify offers an unlimited subscription package, close to the [[Open Music Model]] (OMM)\u2014estimated [[economic equilibrium]]\u2014for the recording industry.
