This compound is a versatile precursor to many other [[silver]] compounds, such as those used in [[photography]]. It is far less sensitive to light than the [[silver halide|halides]]. It was once called ''lunar caustic'' because silver was called ''luna'' by the ancient alchemists, who associated silver with the moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.die.net/lunar%20caustic|title=Definition of Lunar Caustic|work=dictionary.die.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131215637/http://dictionary.die.net/lunar%20caustic|archivedate=2012-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn solid silver [[nitrate]], the silver ions are three-[[Coordination complex|coordinated]] in a trigonal planar arrangement.<ref name=iucr>{{cite journal|first1 = P.|last1 = Meyer|first2 = A.|last2 = Rimsky|first3 = R.|last3 = Chevalier|title = Structure du nitrate d'argent \u00e0 pression et temp\u00e9rature ordinaires.

It is non-[[hygroscopic]], in contrast to [[silver fluoroborate]] and [[silver perchlorate]]. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other [[ligands]], rendering AgNO<sub>3</sub> versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making [[photographic film]], silver nitrate is treated with [[halide]] salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble [[silver halide]] in situ in photographic [[gelatin]], which is then applied to strips of tri-[[acetate]] or [[polyester]]. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the [[silver fulminate|fulminate]], [[silver azide|azide]], or [[silver acetylide|acetylide]], through a [[precipitation reaction]].\n\nTreatment of silver nitrate with base gives dark grey [[silver oxide]]:<ref>{{OrgSynth|author = Campaigne, E.; LeSuer, W.

This reaction is commonly used in [[inorganic chemistry]] to abstract halides:\n\n:{{chem|Ag|+}}(aq) + {{chem|X|-}}(aq) \u2192 AgX(s)\n\nwhere {{chem|X|-}} = {{chem|Cl|-}}, {{chem|Br|-}}, or {{chem|I|-}}.\n\nOther silver salts with [[non-coordinating anions]], namely [[silver tetrafluoroborate]] and [[silver hexafluorophosphate]] are used for more demanding applications.\n\nSimilarly, this reaction is used in [[analytical chemistry]] to confirm the presence of [[chloride]], [[bromide]], or [[iodide]] [[ions]]. Samples are typically acidified with dilute nitric acid to remove interfering ions, e.g. [[carbonate]] ions and [[sulfide]] ions. This step avoids confusion of [[silver sulfide]] or [[silver carbonate]] precipitates with that of silver halides. The color of precipitate varies with the halide: white ([[silver chloride]]), pale yellow/cream ([[silver bromide]]), yellow ([[silver iodide]]). AgBr and especially AgI [[photochemistry|photo-decompose]] to the metal, as evidence by a grayish color on exposed samples.\n\nThe same reaction was used on steamships in order to determine whether or not [[boiler feedwater]] had been contaminated with [[seawater]]. It is still used to determine if moisture on formerly dry cargo is a result of [[condensation]] from humid air, or from seawater leaking through the hull.<ref>{{cite web| title =Silver nitrate method| website =Transport Information Service| publisher =Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaf| url =http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/misc/silber.htm| accessdate = 22 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Organic synthesis===\nSilver nitrate is used in many ways in [[organic synthesis]], e.g. for [[deprotection]] and oxidations. {{chem|Ag|+}} binds [[alkene]]s reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption.

However, if more than 1 gram of silver is accumulated in the body, a condition called [[argyria]] may develop. Argyria is a permanent cosmetic condition in which the skin and internal organs turn a blue-gray color. The United States Environmental Protection Agency used to have a maximum contaminant limit for silver in water until 1990, when it was determined that argyria did not impact the function of any affected organs despite the discolouration.<ref name=\"silver compounds\">\"Silver Compounds.\" Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. Vol. 22. Fourth Ed. Excec. Ed. Jaqueline I. Kroschwitz.

It is non-[[hygroscopic]], in contrast to [[silver fluoroborate]] and [[silver perchlorate]]. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other [[ligands]], rendering AgNO<sub>3</sub> versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making [[photographic film]], silver nitrate is treated with [[halide]] salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble [[silver halide]] in situ in photographic [[gelatin]], which is then applied to strips of tri-[[acetate]] or [[polyester]]. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the [[silver fulminate|fulminate]], [[silver azide|azide]], or [[silver acetylide|acetylide]], through a [[precipitation reaction]].\n\nTreatment of silver nitrate with base gives dark grey [[silver oxide]]:<ref>{{OrgSynth|author = Campaigne, E.; LeSuer, W.

This reaction is commonly used in [[inorganic chemistry]] to abstract halides:\n\n:{{chem|Ag|+}}(aq) + {{chem|X|-}}(aq) \u2192 AgX(s)\n\nwhere {{chem|X|-}} = {{chem|Cl|-}}, {{chem|Br|-}}, or {{chem|I|-}}.\n\nOther silver salts with [[non-coordinating anions]], namely [[silver tetrafluoroborate]] and [[silver hexafluorophosphate]] are used for more demanding applications.\n\nSimilarly, this reaction is used in [[analytical chemistry]] to confirm the presence of [[chloride]], [[bromide]], or [[iodide]] [[ions]]. Samples are typically acidified with dilute nitric acid to remove interfering ions, e.g. [[carbonate]] ions and [[sulfide]] ions. This step avoids confusion of [[silver sulfide]] or [[silver carbonate]] precipitates with that of silver halides. The color of precipitate varies with the halide: white ([[silver chloride]]), pale yellow/cream ([[silver bromide]]), yellow ([[silver iodide]]). AgBr and especially AgI [[photochemistry|photo-decompose]] to the metal, as evidence by a grayish color on exposed samples.\n\nThe same reaction was used on steamships in order to determine whether or not [[boiler feedwater]] had been contaminated with [[seawater]].

Ford named his first car the [[Ford Model A (1903\u201304)|Model A]] and proceeded through the alphabet up through the Model T, twenty models in all. Not all the models went into production.

The follow-up to the Model T was the [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Ford Model A]], rather than the \"Model U\". The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Ford wanted to start all over again with the letter A.\n\nThe Model T was Ford's first automobile [[mass production|mass-produced]] on moving assembly lines with completely [[interchangeable parts]], marketed to the [[American middle class|middle class]].<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref> Henry Ford said of the vehicle:\n<blockquote>\nI will build a motor car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise.

This was closer to that used for stationary [[gas engine]]s than the expensive high-voltage [[ignition magneto]]s that were used on some other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The system did not need a starting battery, since proper hand-cranking would generate enough current for starting. Electric lighting powered by the magneto was adopted in 1915, replacing acetylene and oil lamps, but electric starting was not offered until 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modelt.ca/history |title=History of the Ford Motor Company \u2013 Fast Facts |website=The Frontenac Motor Company & The Ford Model T |access-date=2017-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. \n\nThe [[Fordson]] Model F tractor engine, that was designed about a decade later, was very similar to, but larger than, the Model T engine.<ref name=\"Manly1919p268\">{{Harvnb|Manly|1919|p=268}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission and drive train===\n[[File:Model T pedals.jpg|thumb|The three pedal controls of the Model{{nbsp}}T]]\n[[File:1920 Ford Model T Controls (1495288990).jpg|thumb|View of the driver's controls, 1920 Model{{nbsp}}T]]\nThe Model T was a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle. Its [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was a [[planetary gear]] type billed as \"three speed\". In today's terms it would be considered a two-speed, because one of the three speeds was reverse.\n\nThe Model T's transmission was controlled with three floor-mounted pedals and a lever mounted to the road side of the driver's seat. The [[throttle]] was controlled with a lever on the [[steering wheel]]. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward \u2013 in any other position, the pedal would only move up as far as the central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.\n\nThe first 800 units were sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the [[car controls#Pedals|clutch and brake pedals]].<ref name=\"Kimes1989p551\"/> The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal operated the [[transmission brake]] \u2013 there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the [[parking brake]], which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.\n\nAlthough it was uncommon, the drive bands could fall out of adjustment, allowing the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a [[wet clutch]], this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] through a single [[universal joint]] attached to a [[torque tube]] which drove the rear [[axle]]; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. The heavy-duty ''[[Ford Model TT|Model TT]]'' truck chassis came with a special [[worm gear]] rear differential with lower gearing than the normal car and truck, giving more pulling power but a lower top speed (the frame was also stronger; the cab and engine were the same). A Model TT is easily identifiable by the cylindrical housing for the worm-drive over the axle differential. All gears were [[vanadium steel]] running in an oil bath.\n\n====Transmission bands and linings====\nTwo main types of band lining material were used:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordmodelt.net/transmission.htm |title=Ford Model T Transmission |website=FordModelT.net |access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref>\n* '''Cotton''' \u2013 Cotton woven linings were the original type fitted and specified by Ford.  Generally, the cotton lining is \"kinder\" to the drum surface, with damage to the drum caused only by the retaining rivets scoring the drum surface. Although this in itself did not pose a problem, a dragging band resulting from improper adjustment caused overheating of the transmission and engine, diminished power, and&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of cotton linings&nbsp;\u2013 rapid destruction of the band lining.\n* '''Wood''' \u2013 Wooden linings were originally offered as a \"longer life\" accessory part during the life of the Model T. They were a single piece of steam bent wood and metal wire, fitted to the normal Model T transmission band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pag\u00e9|first=Victor Wilfred |date=1917 |title=The Model T Ford Car, Its Construction, Operation and Repair: A Complete Practical Treatise Explaining the Operating Principles of All Parts of the Ford Automobile, with Complete Instructions for Driving and Maintenance|page=241 |publisher=Norman W. Henley Publishing Co.}}</ref> These bands give a very different feel to the pedals, with much more of a \"bite\" feel. The sensation is of a definite \"grip\" of the drum and seemed to noticeably increase the feel, in particular of the brake drum.\n\n===Suspension and wheels===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Ford model t suspension.triddle.jpg|thumb|The suspension components of a Ford Model T. The coil-spring device is an aftermarket accessory, the \"Hassler shock absorber\".]]\n\nModel T suspension employed a transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring for each of the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.\n\nThe front axle was [[drop forged]] as a single piece of vanadium steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated [[band brake]]s acting on the inside of the rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.\n\nWheels were wooden [[artillery wheel]]s, with steel welded-spoke wheels available in 1926 and 1927.\n\nTires were [[Tire|pneumatic]] [[Clincher tire|clincher]] type, {{convert|30|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide in the rear,  {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the front. Clinchers needed much higher pressure than today's tires, typically {{convert|60|psi|abbr=on}}, to prevent them from leaving the rim at speed. Horseshoe nails on the roads, together with the high pressure, made flat tires a common problem.\n\nBalloon tires became available in 1925. They were {{convert|21|x|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible \u2013 typically {{convert|35|psi|abbr=on}} \u2013 giving a softer ride. The steering gear ratio was changed from 4:1 to 5:1 with the introduction of balloon tires.<ref>{{cite book |title=Model T Ford Service |publisher=Ford}}</ref> The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} (rim diameter) \u00d7 {{convert|4.5|in|abbr=on}} (tire width) wheels has about the same outer diameter as 30 in (76&nbsp;cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an [[inner tube]] to hold the pressurized air; [[tubeless tire]]s were not generally in use until much later.\n\n[[Wheelbase]] was 100&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;cm) and standard track width was 56 inch (142&nbsp;cm); 60 inch (152&nbsp;cm) track could be obtained on special order, \"for Southern roads\", identical to [[Track gauge in the United States#5ft|the pre-Civil War track gauge]] for many railroads in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The standard 56 inch track being very near the standard {{frac|4 foot 8|1|2}} inch railroad track gauge meant that Model Ts could be and frequently were, fitted with flanged wheels and used as railway vehicles; the availability of a 60in (5ft) version meant the same could be done on the few remaining Southern 5ft railways (these being the only nonstandard lines remaining, except for a few narrow-gauge lines of various sizes).  Although a Model T could be adapted to run on track as narrow as 2ft gauge (Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington RR, Maine has one), this was a more complex alteration.\n\n===Colors===\nBy 1918, half of all the cars in the U.S. were Model Ts. In his autobiography, Ford reports that in 1909 he told his management team, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\"<!-- DO NOT TRY TO COPY EDIT THIS QUOTE; IT IS ALREADY *VERBATIM* AND ALREADY ACCEPTABLY WRITTEN. --><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p=72}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the first years of production from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\">{{Harvnb|McCalley|1994}}.</ref> but rather only gray, green, blue, and red.  Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the \"any color so long as it is black\" policy finally implemented. It is often stated Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the low cost, durability, and faster drying time of black paint in that era. Paint choices in the American automotive industry, as well as in others (including locomotives, furniture, bicycles, and the rapidly expanding field of electrical appliances), were shaped by the development of the [[chemical industry]]. These included the disruption of dye sources during [[World War I]] and the advent, in the mid-1920s, of new [[Lacquer#Nitrocellulose lacquers|nitrocellulose lacquer]]s that were faster-drying and more scratch-resistant, and obviated the need for multiple coats;<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\">{{Harvnb|Dutton|1942}}.</ref>{{rp|261\u2013301}} understanding the choice of paints for the Model T era and the years immediately following requires an understanding of the contemporary chemical industry.<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\"/>\n\nDuring the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car.<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\"/> These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and method of drying.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:1910Ford-T.jpg|thumb|1910 Model T, photographed in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\n[[File:Ford_T_1917.jpg|thumb|1917 Model T]]\n[[File:Ford Speedster T.JPG|thumb|T Speedster]]\n[[File:1925.ford.model.t.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|1925 Ford \"New Model\" T Tudor Sedan]]\nAlthough Ford classified the Model T with a single letter designation throughout its entire life and made no distinction by model years, enough significant changes to the body were made over the production life that the car may be classified into several style generations.  Among the most immediately visible and identifiable changes were in the hood and cowl areas, although many other modifications were made to the vehicle.\n* 1909\u20131914 \u2013 Characterized by a nearly straight, five-sided hood, with a flat top containing a center hinge and two side sloping sections containing the folding hinges. The firewall was flat from the windshield down with no distinct cowl.\n* 1915\u20131916 \u2013 The hood design was nearly the same five-sided design with the only obvious change being the addition of louvers to the vertical sides.  A significant change to the cowl area occurred with the windshield relocated significantly behind the firewall and joined with a compound-contoured cowl panel.\n* 1917\u20131923 \u2013 The hood design was changed to a tapered design with a curved top. The folding hinges were now located at the joint between the flat sides and the curved top. This is sometime referred to as the \"low hood\" to distinguish it from the later hoods. The back edge of the hood now met the front edge of the cowl panel so that no part of the flat firewall was visible outside of the hood.  This design was used the longest and during the highest production years, accounting for about half of the total number of Model Ts built.\n* 1923\u20131925 \u2013 This change was made during the 1923 calendar year, so models built earlier in the year have the older design, while later vehicles have the newer design.  The taper of the hood was increased and the rear section at the firewall is about an inch taller and several inches wider than the previous design.  While this is a relatively minor change, the parts between the third and fourth generations are not interchangeable.\n* 1926\u20131927 \u2013 This design change made the greatest difference in the appearance of the car.  The hood was again enlarged, with the cowl panel no longer a compound curve and blended much more with the line of the hood.  The distance between the firewall and the windshield was also increased significantly.  This style is sometimes referred to as the \"high hood\".\n\nThe styling on the last \"generation\" was a preview for the following Model A, but the two models are visually quite different, as the body on the A was much wider and had curved doors as opposed to the flat doors on the T.\n\n===Diverse applications===\n[[File:Model T tractor.png|thumb|A Model T [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractor]] pulling a plow]]\n[[File:Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advert 1918.png|thumb|Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advertisement, 1918]]\n[[File:Ford-American LaFrance 1919 Model-T firefighting vehicle.jpg|thumb|The American LaFrance company modified more than 900 Ford Model T's to serve firefighters.]]\nWhen the Model T was designed and introduced, the infrastructure of the world was quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term \"pavement\" as equivalent with \"sidewalk\" comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. [[Power tool]]s were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. [[Rural electrification]] and motorized [[mechanization]] were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and [[portable engine]] as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a [[flat belt]] to drive a [[bucksaw]], [[threshing machine|thresher]], silo blower, conveyor for filling [[corn crib]]s or haylofts, [[baler]], water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of ''Fordson Farmer'' magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Robert|title=The Model T A Centennial History|url=https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-8850-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case/page/148 148]}}</ref>\n\nDuring this era, entire automobiles (including thousands of Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently dedicated to a purpose, such as [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractors]] and ice saws.<ref>{{cite web |title=1926 Ford Model T Ice Saw |url=http://owlshead.org/collections/detail/1926-ford-t-ice-saw |accessdate=2012-12-24 |publisher=Owl's Head Transportation Museum}} Used for harvesting winter ice from ponds in [[Maine]].</ref> Dozens of [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] companies sold [[prefabrication|prefab]] kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor.<ref name=\"PrippsMorland1993p28\">{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.</ref> The Model T had been around for a decade before the [[Fordson tractor]] became available (1917\u201318), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, [[Harry Ferguson]], later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the [[Farmall]] (1924), as well as other light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.<ref name=\"Leffingwell2002pp43-51\">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2002|pp=43\u201351}}.</ref>\n\nLike many popular car engines of the era, the Model T engine was also used on home-built aircraft (such as the [[Pietenpol Sky Scout]]) and [[motorboat]]s.\n\nAn [[armored car (military)|armored-car]] variant (called the [[Ford FT-B|FT-B]]) was developed in Poland in 1920 due to the high demand during the [[Polish-Soviet war]] in 1920.\n\nMany Model Ts were converted into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits on the rear wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of [[continuous track]] to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a [[half-track]]) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time.  The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was \"snowflyers\".

When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] could not keep up with demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park complex]]. During this time the Model T production system ([[Vertical integration|including the]] [[supply chain]]) transitioned into an iconic example of assembly line production.<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/><ref name=Abernathy/> In subsequent decades it would also come to be viewed as the classic example of the rigid, first-generation version of assembly line production, as opposed to flexible mass production<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/> of higher quality products.<ref name=Abernathy>{{cite web |last1=Abernathy |first1=William J. |last2=Wayne |first2=Kenneth |title=Limits of the Learning Curve |url=https://hbr.org/1974/09/limits-of-the-learning-curve |website=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=1 September 1974 |quote=Ford\u2019s objective was to reduce the price of the automobile and thereby increase volume and market share. <br> \"Ford\u2019s long devotion to the experience-curve strategy made the transition to another strategy difficult and very costly\" (going from reducing Model T cost to increasing Model A price) \"From the time it introduced the Model A, Ford was compelled to compete on the basis of product quality and performance \u2014 a strategy in which it was not skilled\" <br> The rate of capital investment showed substantial increases after 1913, rising from 11 cents per sales dollar that year to 22 cents by 1921.

These facilities even included coal mines, rubber plantations, and forestry operations (to provide wooden car parts).

Almost 170,000 were built after car production stopped, as replacement engines were required to service already produced vehicles. Racers and enthusiasts, forerunners of modern hot rodders, used the Model T's block to build popular and cheap racing engines, including [[Cragar]], [[Navarro (hot rodder)|Navarro]], and famously the [[Frontenac (racing car)|Frontenacs]] (\"Fronty Fords\")<ref name=nac/> of the [[Chevrolet]] brothers, among many others.\n\nThe Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of [[vanadium steel]] alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of [[materials engineering]], and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.\n\nIn 2002, Ford built a final batch of six Model Ts as part of their 2003 centenary celebrations. These cars were assembled from remaining new components and other parts produced from the original drawings. The last of the six was used for publicity purposes in the UK.\n\nAlthough Ford no longer manufactures parts for the Model T, many parts are still manufactured through [[Privately held company|private companies]] as replicas to service the thousands of Model Ts still in operation today.\n\nOn May 26, 1927, Henry Ford and his son Edsel drove the 15-millionth Model T out of the factory.<ref name=15million/> This marked the famous automobile's official last day of production at the main factory.\n\n===Price and production===\n[[File: Phoenix-Phoenix Police Museum-1919 Ford Model TPolice Cruiser.jpg |300px|thumb|1919 Ford Model T Phoenix Police Cruiser]]\n{{external media\n| image1=[https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/7409/74501_A.gif Ford Model T price/volume curve, 1909-1923]\n}}\n\nThe moving assembly line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford to reduce the price of his cars.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331 |title=Ford's Assembly Line Turns 100: How It Changed Manufacturing and Society |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2013-10-07 |access-date=2017-08-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021237/http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331 |archive-date=2013-11-30}}</ref> As he continued to fine-tune the system, Ford was able to keep reducing costs significantly.<ref name=imf>{{cite web|url= https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2017/05/22/Riding-the-Energy-Transition-Oil-Beyond-2040-44932 |title=Riding the Energy Transition : Oil Beyond 2040 |first1=Reda |last1=Cherif |first2=Fuad |last2=Hasanov |first3=Aditya |last3=Pande |publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] |date=2017-05-22 |accessdate=2017-10-07 |page=13 |quote=Vehicle adoption is strongly associated with the ability to offer an affordable price.

Originally named Ford Charcoal, the name was changed to [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford Charcoal]] after the Iron Mountain Ford Plant closed in 1951 and the Kingsford Chemical Company was formed and continued the wood distillation process. E. G. Kingsford, Ford's cousin by marriage, brokered the selection of the new sawmill and wood distillation plant site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsford.com/our-heritage/ |title=Our Heritage |publisher=Kingsford |accessdate=2012-12-24}}</ref> Lumber for production of the Model T came from the same location, built in 1920 called the Iron Mountain Ford which incorporated a sawmill where lumber from Ford purchased land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was cut and dried. Scrap wood was distilled at the Iron Mountain plant for its wood chemicals, with the end by product being lump charcoal. This lump charcoal was modified and pressed into briquettes and mass marketed by Ford.<ref name=\"Chronicle\">{{cite journal|last1=Forstrom|first1=Guy|title=The Burning History of the Charcoal Briquette|journal=Historical Society of Michigan|date=Summer 2017|volume=40|issue=2|pages=13\u201315}}</ref>\n\n===First global car===\n[[File:Ford factory LaBoca.jpg|thumb|right|The first Ford assembly plant in [[La Boca, Buenos Aires]], c. 1921]]\n[[File:Feature.

Ford named his first car the [[Ford Model A (1903\u201304)|Model A]] and proceeded through the alphabet up through the Model T, twenty models in all. Not all the models went into production.

The follow-up to the Model T was the [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Ford Model A]], rather than the \"Model U\". The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Ford wanted to start all over again with the letter A.\n\nThe Model T was Ford's first automobile [[mass production|mass-produced]] on moving assembly lines with completely [[interchangeable parts]], marketed to the [[American middle class|middle class]].<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref> Henry Ford said of the vehicle:\n<blockquote>\nI will build a motor car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise.

The engines of the first 2,447 units were cooled with [[pump|water pumps]]; the engines of unit 2,448 and onward, with a few exceptions prior to around unit 2,500, were cooled by [[thermosiphon|thermosiphon action]].<ref name=\"Kimes1989p551\">{{Harvp|Kimes|Clark Jr.|1989|p=551}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[ignition system]] used in the Model T was an unusual one, with a low-voltage [[magneto]] incorporated in the flywheel, supplying alternating current to [[trembler coil]]s to drive the [[spark plug]]s. This was closer to that used for stationary [[gas engine]]s than the expensive high-voltage [[ignition magneto]]s that were used on some other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The system did not need a starting battery, since proper hand-cranking would generate enough current for starting. Electric lighting powered by the magneto was adopted in 1915, replacing acetylene and oil lamps, but electric starting was not offered until 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modelt.ca/history |title=History of the Ford Motor Company \u2013 Fast Facts |website=The Frontenac Motor Company & The Ford Model T |access-date=2017-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. \n\nThe [[Fordson]] Model F tractor engine, that was designed about a decade later, was very similar to, but larger than, the Model T engine.<ref name=\"Manly1919p268\">{{Harvnb|Manly|1919|p=268}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission and drive train===\n[[File:Model T pedals.jpg|thumb|The three pedal controls of the Model{{nbsp}}T]]\n[[File:1920 Ford Model T Controls (1495288990).jpg|thumb|View of the driver's controls, 1920 Model{{nbsp}}T]]\nThe Model T was a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle. Its [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was a [[planetary gear]] type billed as \"three speed\". In today's terms it would be considered a two-speed, because one of the three speeds was reverse.\n\nThe Model T's transmission was controlled with three floor-mounted pedals and a lever mounted to the road side of the driver's seat. The [[throttle]] was controlled with a lever on the [[steering wheel]]. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward \u2013 in any other position, the pedal would only move up as far as the central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.\n\nThe first 800 units were sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the [[car controls#Pedals|clutch and brake pedals]].<ref name=\"Kimes1989p551\"/> The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal operated the [[transmission brake]] \u2013 there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the [[parking brake]], which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.\n\nAlthough it was uncommon, the drive bands could fall out of adjustment, allowing the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a [[wet clutch]], this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] through a single [[universal joint]] attached to a [[torque tube]] which drove the rear [[axle]]; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. The heavy-duty ''[[Ford Model TT|Model TT]]'' truck chassis came with a special [[worm gear]] rear differential with lower gearing than the normal car and truck, giving more pulling power but a lower top speed (the frame was also stronger; the cab and engine were the same). A Model TT is easily identifiable by the cylindrical housing for the worm-drive over the axle differential. All gears were [[vanadium steel]] running in an oil bath.\n\n====Transmission bands and linings====\nTwo main types of band lining material were used:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordmodelt.net/transmission.htm |title=Ford Model T Transmission |website=FordModelT.net |access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref>\n* '''Cotton''' \u2013 Cotton woven linings were the original type fitted and specified by Ford.  Generally, the cotton lining is \"kinder\" to the drum surface, with damage to the drum caused only by the retaining rivets scoring the drum surface. Although this in itself did not pose a problem, a dragging band resulting from improper adjustment caused overheating of the transmission and engine, diminished power, and&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of cotton linings&nbsp;\u2013 rapid destruction of the band lining.\n* '''Wood''' \u2013 Wooden linings were originally offered as a \"longer life\" accessory part during the life of the Model T. They were a single piece of steam bent wood and metal wire, fitted to the normal Model T transmission band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pag\u00e9|first=Victor Wilfred |date=1917 |title=The Model T Ford Car, Its Construction, Operation and Repair: A Complete Practical Treatise Explaining the Operating Principles of All Parts of the Ford Automobile, with Complete Instructions for Driving and Maintenance|page=241 |publisher=Norman W. Henley Publishing Co.}}</ref> These bands give a very different feel to the pedals, with much more of a \"bite\" feel. The sensation is of a definite \"grip\" of the drum and seemed to noticeably increase the feel, in particular of the brake drum.\n\n===Suspension and wheels===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Ford model t suspension.triddle.jpg|thumb|The suspension components of a Ford Model T. The coil-spring device is an aftermarket accessory, the \"Hassler shock absorber\".]]\n\nModel T suspension employed a transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring for each of the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.\n\nThe front axle was [[drop forged]] as a single piece of vanadium steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated [[band brake]]s acting on the inside of the rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.\n\nWheels were wooden [[artillery wheel]]s, with steel welded-spoke wheels available in 1926 and 1927.\n\nTires were [[Tire|pneumatic]] [[Clincher tire|clincher]] type, {{convert|30|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide in the rear,  {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the front. Clinchers needed much higher pressure than today's tires, typically {{convert|60|psi|abbr=on}}, to prevent them from leaving the rim at speed. Horseshoe nails on the roads, together with the high pressure, made flat tires a common problem.\n\nBalloon tires became available in 1925. They were {{convert|21|x|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible \u2013 typically {{convert|35|psi|abbr=on}} \u2013 giving a softer ride. The steering gear ratio was changed from 4:1 to 5:1 with the introduction of balloon tires.<ref>{{cite book |title=Model T Ford Service |publisher=Ford}}</ref> The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} (rim diameter) \u00d7 {{convert|4.5|in|abbr=on}} (tire width) wheels has about the same outer diameter as 30 in (76&nbsp;cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an [[inner tube]] to hold the pressurized air; [[tubeless tire]]s were not generally in use until much later.\n\n[[Wheelbase]] was 100&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;cm) and standard track width was 56 inch (142&nbsp;cm); 60 inch (152&nbsp;cm) track could be obtained on special order, \"for Southern roads\", identical to [[Track gauge in the United States#5ft|the pre-Civil War track gauge]] for many railroads in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The standard 56 inch track being very near the standard {{frac|4 foot 8|1|2}} inch railroad track gauge meant that Model Ts could be and frequently were, fitted with flanged wheels and used as railway vehicles; the availability of a 60in (5ft) version meant the same could be done on the few remaining Southern 5ft railways (these being the only nonstandard lines remaining, except for a few narrow-gauge lines of various sizes).  Although a Model T could be adapted to run on track as narrow as 2ft gauge (Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington RR, Maine has one), this was a more complex alteration.\n\n===Colors===\nBy 1918, half of all the cars in the U.S. were Model Ts. In his autobiography, Ford reports that in 1909 he told his management team, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\"<!-- DO NOT TRY TO COPY EDIT THIS QUOTE; IT IS ALREADY *VERBATIM* AND ALREADY ACCEPTABLY WRITTEN. --><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p=72}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the first years of production from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\">{{Harvnb|McCalley|1994}}.</ref> but rather only gray, green, blue, and red.  Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the \"any color so long as it is black\" policy finally implemented. It is often stated Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the low cost, durability, and faster drying time of black paint in that era. Paint choices in the American automotive industry, as well as in others (including locomotives, furniture, bicycles, and the rapidly expanding field of electrical appliances), were shaped by the development of the [[chemical industry]]. These included the disruption of dye sources during [[World War I]] and the advent, in the mid-1920s, of new [[Lacquer#Nitrocellulose lacquers|nitrocellulose lacquer]]s that were faster-drying and more scratch-resistant, and obviated the need for multiple coats;<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\">{{Harvnb|Dutton|1942}}.</ref>{{rp|261\u2013301}} understanding the choice of paints for the Model T era and the years immediately following requires an understanding of the contemporary chemical industry.<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\"/>\n\nDuring the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car.<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\"/> These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and method of drying.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:1910Ford-T.jpg|thumb|1910 Model T, photographed in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\n[[File:Ford_T_1917.jpg|thumb|1917 Model T]]\n[[File:Ford Speedster T.JPG|thumb|T Speedster]]\n[[File:1925.ford.model.t.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|1925 Ford \"New Model\" T Tudor Sedan]]\nAlthough Ford classified the Model T with a single letter designation throughout its entire life and made no distinction by model years, enough significant changes to the body were made over the production life that the car may be classified into several style generations.  Among the most immediately visible and identifiable changes were in the hood and cowl areas, although many other modifications were made to the vehicle.\n* 1909\u20131914 \u2013 Characterized by a nearly straight, five-sided hood, with a flat top containing a center hinge and two side sloping sections containing the folding hinges. The firewall was flat from the windshield down with no distinct cowl.\n* 1915\u20131916 \u2013 The hood design was nearly the same five-sided design with the only obvious change being the addition of louvers to the vertical sides.  A significant change to the cowl area occurred with the windshield relocated significantly behind the firewall and joined with a compound-contoured cowl panel.\n* 1917\u20131923 \u2013 The hood design was changed to a tapered design with a curved top. The folding hinges were now located at the joint between the flat sides and the curved top. This is sometime referred to as the \"low hood\" to distinguish it from the later hoods. The back edge of the hood now met the front edge of the cowl panel so that no part of the flat firewall was visible outside of the hood.  This design was used the longest and during the highest production years, accounting for about half of the total number of Model Ts built.\n* 1923\u20131925 \u2013 This change was made during the 1923 calendar year, so models built earlier in the year have the older design, while later vehicles have the newer design.  The taper of the hood was increased and the rear section at the firewall is about an inch taller and several inches wider than the previous design.  While this is a relatively minor change, the parts between the third and fourth generations are not interchangeable.\n* 1926\u20131927 \u2013 This design change made the greatest difference in the appearance of the car.  The hood was again enlarged, with the cowl panel no longer a compound curve and blended much more with the line of the hood.  The distance between the firewall and the windshield was also increased significantly.  This style is sometimes referred to as the \"high hood\".\n\nThe styling on the last \"generation\" was a preview for the following Model A, but the two models are visually quite different, as the body on the A was much wider and had curved doors as opposed to the flat doors on the T.\n\n===Diverse applications===\n[[File:Model T tractor.png|thumb|A Model T [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractor]] pulling a plow]]\n[[File:Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advert 1918.png|thumb|Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advertisement, 1918]]\n[[File:Ford-American LaFrance 1919 Model-T firefighting vehicle.jpg|thumb|The American LaFrance company modified more than 900 Ford Model T's to serve firefighters.]]\nWhen the Model T was designed and introduced, the infrastructure of the world was quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term \"pavement\" as equivalent with \"sidewalk\" comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. [[Power tool]]s were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. [[Rural electrification]] and motorized [[mechanization]] were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and [[portable engine]] as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a [[flat belt]] to drive a [[bucksaw]], [[threshing machine|thresher]], silo blower, conveyor for filling [[corn crib]]s or haylofts, [[baler]], water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of ''Fordson Farmer'' magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Robert|title=The Model T A Centennial History|url=https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-8850-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case/page/148 148]}}</ref>\n\nDuring this era, entire automobiles (including thousands of Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently dedicated to a purpose, such as [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractors]] and ice saws.<ref>{{cite web |title=1926 Ford Model T Ice Saw |url=http://owlshead.org/collections/detail/1926-ford-t-ice-saw |accessdate=2012-12-24 |publisher=Owl's Head Transportation Museum}} Used for harvesting winter ice from ponds in [[Maine]].</ref> Dozens of [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] companies sold [[prefabrication|prefab]] kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor.<ref name=\"PrippsMorland1993p28\">{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.</ref> The Model T had been around for a decade before the [[Fordson tractor]] became available (1917\u201318), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, [[Harry Ferguson]], later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the [[Farmall]] (1924), as well as other light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.<ref name=\"Leffingwell2002pp43-51\">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2002|pp=43\u201351}}.</ref>\n\nLike many popular car engines of the era, the Model T engine was also used on home-built aircraft (such as the [[Pietenpol Sky Scout]]) and [[motorboat]]s.\n\nAn [[armored car (military)|armored-car]] variant (called the [[Ford FT-B|FT-B]]) was developed in Poland in 1920 due to the high demand during the [[Polish-Soviet war]] in 1920.\n\nMany Model Ts were converted into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits on the rear wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of [[continuous track]] to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a [[half-track]]) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time.  The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was \"snowflyers\".

When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] could not keep up with demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park complex]]. During this time the Model T production system ([[Vertical integration|including the]] [[supply chain]]) transitioned into an iconic example of assembly line production.<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/><ref name=Abernathy/> In subsequent decades it would also come to be viewed as the classic example of the rigid, first-generation version of assembly line production, as opposed to flexible mass production<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/> of higher quality products.<ref name=Abernathy>{{cite web |last1=Abernathy |first1=William J. |last2=Wayne |first2=Kenneth |title=Limits of the Learning Curve |url=https://hbr.org/1974/09/limits-of-the-learning-curve |website=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=1 September 1974 |quote=Ford\u2019s objective was to reduce the price of the automobile and thereby increase volume and market share. <br> \"Ford\u2019s long devotion to the experience-curve strategy made the transition to another strategy difficult and very costly\" (going from reducing Model T cost to increasing Model A price) \"From the time it introduced the Model A, Ford was compelled to compete on the basis of product quality and performance \u2014 a strategy in which it was not skilled\" <br> The rate of capital investment showed substantial increases after 1913, rising from 11 cents per sales dollar that year to 22 cents by 1921.

These facilities even included coal mines, rubber plantations, and forestry operations (to provide wooden car parts).

The Model T was a great commercial success, and by the time Ford made its 10 millionth car, half of all cars in the world were Fords. It was so successful Ford did not purchase any advertising between 1917 and 1923; instead, the Model T became so famous, people considered it a norm.

Almost 170,000 were built after car production stopped, as replacement engines were required to service already produced vehicles. Racers and enthusiasts, forerunners of modern hot rodders, used the Model T's block to build popular and cheap racing engines, including [[Cragar]], [[Navarro (hot rodder)|Navarro]], and famously the [[Frontenac (racing car)|Frontenacs]] (\"Fronty Fords\")<ref name=nac/> of the [[Chevrolet]] brothers, among many others.\n\nThe Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of [[vanadium steel]] alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of [[materials engineering]], and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.\n\nIn 2002, Ford built a final batch of six Model Ts as part of their 2003 centenary celebrations. These cars were assembled from remaining new components and other parts produced from the original drawings.

Originally named Ford Charcoal, the name was changed to [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford Charcoal]] after the Iron Mountain Ford Plant closed in 1951 and the Kingsford Chemical Company was formed and continued the wood distillation process. E. G. Kingsford, Ford's cousin by marriage, brokered the selection of the new sawmill and wood distillation plant site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsford.com/our-heritage/ |title=Our Heritage |publisher=Kingsford |accessdate=2012-12-24}}</ref> Lumber for production of the Model T came from the same location, built in 1920 called the Iron Mountain Ford which incorporated a sawmill where lumber from Ford purchased land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was cut and dried. Scrap wood was distilled at the Iron Mountain plant for its wood chemicals, with the end by product being lump charcoal. This lump charcoal was modified and pressed into briquettes and mass marketed by Ford.<ref name=\"Chronicle\">{{cite journal|last1=Forstrom|first1=Guy|title=The Burning History of the Charcoal Briquette|journal=Historical Society of Michigan|date=Summer 2017|volume=40|issue=2|pages=13\u201315}}</ref>\n\n===First global car===\n[[File:Ford factory LaBoca.jpg|thumb|right|The first Ford assembly plant in [[La Boca, Buenos Aires]], c. 1921]]\n[[File:Feature.

However, Model T's in the Confederacy proved difficult to maintain as none had been built locally.

Chamoiseau is the author of a historical work on the [[Antilles]] under the reign of [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] and several non-fiction books which include ''\u00c9loge de la [[cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]]'' (In Praise of Creoleness), co-authored with [[Jean Bernab\u00e9]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl Confiant]]. \nAwarded the [[Prix Carbet de la Cara\u00efbe et du Tout-Monde|Prix Carbet]] (1990) for ''Antan d\u2019enfance''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717080226/http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> ''Antan d'enfance'',  ''Chemin d'\u00e9cole'' and ''\u00c0 Bout d'enfance'' form the autobiographical trilogy ''Une enfance Cr\u00e9ole''. His novel ''[[Texaco (novel)|Texaco]]'' was awarded the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1992, and was chosen as a ''[[New York Times]]'' ''Notable Book of the Year''. It has been described as \"a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon\u2019s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' and Cesaire\u2019s ''[[Return to My Native Land]]''.\"<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-24-refuge-for-the-wretched Refuge for the wretched], by PERCY ZVOMUYA, ''Mail & Guardian'', 24 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Chamoiseau was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] for his contribution to Caribbean society.\n\nChamoiseau may also safely be considered as one of the most innovative writers to hit the French literary scene since [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]. His freeform use of French language \u2014 a highly complex yet fluid mixture of constant invention and \"creolism\" \u2014 fuels a poignant and sensuous depiction of Martinique people in particular and humanity at large.\n\n== Writing Style and Approach ==\n\n=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===\nThe dynamics and relationship between men and women has been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean. The concept of \u2018[[masculinity]]\u2019 versus \u2018[[femininity]]\u2019 is a literary theme that is indicative of Caribbean literature. Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works. However, as there are a larger number of male writer that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven, and takes the \u2018masculinist\u2019 perspective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nChamoiseau has often been criticized as being a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement in the [[Antilles|Antilles archipelago]]. The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers. The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. However, his literary work in the children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\" is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThe representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; however, in Chamoiseau's children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants,\" this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n=== Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 ===\nA question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is 'What does it mean to be Caribbean?'. This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is \"Creoleness\". Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend together on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers. This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of \"Americanness\" in that it existed prior to America, and that \"Americanness\" excludes it interaction with the indigenous population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThis relates to Patrick Chamoiseau's writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness. ''Creole Folktales'' is a prime example from his works. The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral. Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Books===\n* ''Chronique des sept mis\u00e8res'' (1986).

As a result of his family background, young Y\u0131lmaz grew among the working class. This was a strong background for his future works which generally focused on a realistic portrayal of downtrodden and marginalized strata of the population in the country. G\u00fcney studied law and economics at the universities of [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]], but by the age of 21 he found himself actively involved in film-making.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Career in Turkey==\nAs [[Ye\u015fil\u00e7am]], the Turkish studio system, a handful of directors, including [[At\u0131f Y\u0131lmaz]], began to use cinema as a means of addressing the problems of the people. State-sanctioned melodramas, war films, and play adaptations had mostly previously been played in Turkish theaters. These new filmmakers began to shoot and screen more realistic pictures of Kurdish and Turkish life. Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney was one of the most popular names to emerge from this trend, a gruff-looking young actor who earned the moniker ''\u00c7irkin Kral'' (\"the Ugly King\" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) or \"pa\u015fay na\u015fir\u00een\" in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. After working as an apprentice screenwriter for and assistant to At\u0131f Y\u0131lmaz, G\u00fcney soon began appearing in as many as 20 films a year and became Turkey's one of the most popular actors.{{Citation needed}}\n\nThe early 1960s brought restricted freedom to Turkey, and G\u00fcney was imprisoned from 1960 to 1962. In prison he wrote what some labeled a \"[[communist]]\" novel, ''They Died with Their Heads Bowed''.<ref name=NYT/> The country's political situation and G\u00fcney's relationship with the authorities became even more tense in the ensuing years. Not content with his star status atop the Turkish film industry, G\u00fcney began directing his own pictures in 1965. By 1968 he had formed his own production company, G\u00fcney Filmcilik. Over the next few years, the titles of his films mirrored the feelings of the people of Turkey: ''[[Umut (film)|Umut]]'' (''Hope'', 1970); ''[[A\u011f\u0131t]]'' (''Elegy'', 1972); ''[[Ac\u0131]]'' (''Pain'', 1971); ''[[The Hopeless]]'' (1971). Umut is considered to be the first realistic film of Turkish Cinema, the American director [[Elia Kazan]] was among the first to praise the film; \u201cUmut is a poetic film, completely native, not an imitation of Hollywood or any of the European masters, it had risen out of a village environment\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themovingsilent.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/yilmaz-guney-the-ugly-king/|title=Yilmaz Guney|date=30 March 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Yilmazguney.jpg|thumb|200px|{{FFDC|1=Yilmazguney.jpg|log=2009 September 25|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nAfter the military coup in March 1971, he has been in pretrail for weeks, and he decided to leave Istanbul to evade further trouble with the authorities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.harvard.edu/film/films/2011janmar/guney.html|title=Yilmaz G\u00fcney: From \"Ugly King\" to Poet of Despair - Harvard Film Archive|website=library.harvard.edu|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> Arrested for harboring anarchist students, G\u00fcney was jailed in 1972 during preproduction of ''[[Zavall\u0131lar]]'' (''The Miserable'', 1975), and before completing ''[[Endi\u015fe]]'' (''Worry'', 1974), which was finished in 1974 by G\u00fcney's assistant, [[\u015eerif G\u00f6ren]].

His father was from [[Siverek]] in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]] and his mother was from [[Varto]] in [[Mu\u015f Province]].{{ref}}<ref name=\"hurriyet.com.tr\"/> His parents migrated to Adana to work as cotton field laborers. As a result of his family background, young Y\u0131lmaz grew among the working class. This was a strong background for his future works which generally focused on a realistic portrayal of downtrodden and marginalized strata of the population in the country. G\u00fcney studied law and economics at the universities of [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]], but by the age of 21 he found himself actively involved in film-making.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Career in Turkey==\nAs [[Ye\u015fil\u00e7am]], the Turkish studio system, a handful of directors, including [[At\u0131f Y\u0131lmaz]], began to use cinema as a means of addressing the problems of the people. State-sanctioned melodramas, war films, and play adaptations had mostly previously been played in Turkish theaters. These new filmmakers began to shoot and screen more realistic pictures of Kurdish and Turkish life. Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney was one of the most popular names to emerge from this trend, a gruff-looking young actor who earned the moniker ''\u00c7irkin Kral'' (\"the Ugly King\" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) or \"pa\u015fay na\u015fir\u00een\" in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. After working as an apprentice screenwriter for and assistant to At\u0131f Y\u0131lmaz, G\u00fcney soon began appearing in as many as 20 films a year and became Turkey's one of the most popular actors.\n\nThe early 1960s brought restricted freedom to Turkey, and G\u00fcney was imprisoned from 1960 to 1962. In prison he wrote what some labeled a \"[[communist]]\" novel, ''They Died with Their Heads Bowed''.<ref name=NYT/> The country's political situation and G\u00fcney's relationship with the authorities became even more tense in the ensuing years. Not content with his star status atop the Turkish film industry, G\u00fcney began directing his own pictures in 1965. By 1968 he had formed his own production company, G\u00fcney Filmcilik. Over the next few years, the titles of his films mirrored the feelings of the people of Turkey: ''[[Umut (film)|Umut]]'' (''Hope'', 1970); ''[[A\u011f\u0131t]]'' (''Elegy'', 1972); ''[[Ac\u0131]]'' (''Pain'', 1971); ''[[The Hopeless]]'' (1971). Umut is considered to be the first realistic film of Turkish Cinema, the American director [[Elia Kazan]] was among the first to praise the film; \u201cUmut is a poetic film, completely native, not an imitation of Hollywood or any of the European masters, it had risen out of a village environment\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themovingsilent.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/yilmaz-guney-the-ugly-king/|title=Yilmaz Guney|date=30 March 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Yilmazguney.jpg|thumb|200px|{{FFDC|1=Yilmazguney.jpg|log=2009 September 25|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nAfter the military coup in March 1971, he has been in pretrail for weeks, and he decided to leave Istanbul to evade further trouble with the authorities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.harvard.edu/film/films/2011janmar/guney.html|title=Yilmaz G\u00fcney: From \"Ugly King\" to Poet of Despair - Harvard Film Archive|website=library.harvard.edu|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> Arrested for harboring anarchist students, G\u00fcney was jailed in 1972 during preproduction of ''[[Zavall\u0131lar]]'' (''The Miserable'', 1975), and before completing ''[[Endi\u015fe]]'' (''Worry'', 1974), which was finished in 1974 by G\u00fcney's assistant, [[\u015eerif G\u00f6ren]].
