There were too many airlines in Anchorage at the time, and not enough demand to support them. In the next few years the airline performed many mergers and acquisitions that produced changes in the name and saw business expand throughout Alaska. The first of these mergers was in 1934, when McGee sold his namesake airline for US$50,000 to [[Star Air Service]], an airline also located in Anchorage. This allowed McGee to enter the mining industry.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\">{{cite news|last=Glab |first=Jim |title=Alaska Airlines 75th Anniversary |url=http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503104421/http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309 |work=[[Air Transport World]] |archivedate=May 3, 2012 |access-date=May 17, 2012 |date=December 1, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> With a fleet of fifteen aircraft, Star Air Service was a dominant airline in Alaska.

That year, Star Air Service purchased Alaska Interior Airlines and was incorporated as '''Star Air Lines'''.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/> Star was again sold later that year to a group of miners.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1938, federal regulation began when Congress created the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB). The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between [[Seattle]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] was awarded to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]].<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the [[Merrill Field|Anchorage airport]]. That year, the airline's name was changed to '''Alaska Star Airlines'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> The name '''Alaska Airlines''' was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name.<ref name=history_link /> In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.<ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3sMKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3671,3196652&dq=alaska-airlines+new+headquarters&hl=en Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief].

During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar]], its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Expansion after World War II (1945\u20131949)===\n[[File:DC-3 on ice colors adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of a silver Douglas DC-3 aircraft parked on snow-covered ground.|An Alaska Airlines Douglas DC-3, one of the aircraft purchased by the airline after World War II]]\nIn 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1947, jockey James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /><ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\"/> Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II. The airline purchased [[Douglas DC-3]]s, [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando]]s.<ref name=history_link /> Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nAlaska Airlines' large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to [[Paine Field]], an airport north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />  Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five [[Bell 47]]B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>\"Alaska Airlines\" by Cliff & Nancy Hollebeck, http://www.hollenbeckproductions.com</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of [[Yemen]] to [[Israel]] in what became known as [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000 mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from [[Eritrea]] to [[Aden]], then along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to [[Tel Aviv]]. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv in fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Magic Carpet|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/magic-carpet.aspx|website=AlaskaAir}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership (1950s)===\nAlaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, '''Collins Air Service''' and '''Al Jones Airways'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThough the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the [[Douglas DC-6]], the airline's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced \"Golden Nugget\" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Jet age (1960s)===\n[[File:Convair 880-61 Alaska AL in flight 1961.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Left side view of an aircraft in flight|The Convair 880 was Alaska Airlines' first jet aircraft.]]\nIn 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer [[Convair]] to purchase a [[Convair 880]] jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year. In 1966 the company received its first [[Boeing 727-100]] jets and removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters, in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight [[combi aircraft]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft</ref>  In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a [[Convair 990]] jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier [[Varig]] as PP-VJE which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100's which were then joined by stretched [[Boeing 727-200]]s which in turn became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules]] (L382 model), the civil version of the military [[C-130]] cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] and later to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Alaska also owned [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners including two [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner]]s from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049's which were used for [[Military Air Transport Service]] operations.<ref>[http://calclassic.com/starliner.htm California Classic Propliners \u2013 L-1649A Starliners]; Gibson, Tom \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N7316C.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N7316C c/n 1018]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N8083H.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N8083H c/n 1038]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref>  Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated, including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and Super [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[amphibian aircraft]] as well as two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the \"Turbo-Goose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm|website=timetableimages.com|title=June 1, 1967; June 1, 1969 & Sept. 14, 1970 Alaska Airlines system timetables}}</ref> The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] in 1968.\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-100 Alaska Airlines Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft parked on the tarmac, with a tree-covered hill as well as some clouds and buildings in the background|A Boeing 727-100 at [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]]. The airline introduced this type in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nDuring this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines such as [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Pan Am]] and [[Pacific Northern Airlines]], the latter being an Alaska-based air carrier operating [[Boeing 720]] jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]] in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated [[Boeing 747]] wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle\u2013Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle\u2013Fairbanks nonstop with the 747.  To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn December 1962 [[Air Guin\u00e9e]] signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two [[Douglas DC-4]]s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the [[Guinea]]n airline to Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"guttery\">{{cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to [[Wien Air Alaska]]. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional \"Gay Nineties\" theme with stewardesses dressed in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Economic hardship (1970s)===\n[[File:Boeing 727-200Adv Alaska Airlines Durand.jpg|thumb|alt=Left side view of an aircraft approaching an airport, with its nose pitched down slightly.

The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Alaska Airlines was also operating [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]] jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 aircraft at Anchorage (ANC) and Seattle (SEA)</ref>\n\nHowever, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name=history_link /> Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a [[Boeing 727-100]] jetliner [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866|crashed]] on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was {{US$|22}} million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of \"Elastic Airlines.\"<!--\"Elastic Airlines\" is mentioned in the source at the end of the paragraph.--> The logo was changed to an image of a smiling [[Eskimo]], which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Post-deregulation expansion (1978\u20131990)===\nAlaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]], knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor [[Wien Air Alaska]], but this ultimately failed, and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nAt the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US \u2014the city of Seattle\u2014, and it had only ten planes in its fleet.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], and it also introduced service to [[Palm Springs, California]]. [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] were added in 1981.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1979, Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with [[Hughes Air West]], however this never came to fruition. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[California]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in [[Idaho]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" />\n\nDeregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits and salaries. By 1979, competitors [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Western Airlines]] were both flying wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jets on the core Anchorage\u2013Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by [[Wien Air Alaska]] which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Anchorage schedules</ref>  Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks\u2013Seattle route at this time as well.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Fairbanks schedules</ref>  There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants.<ref name=history_link /> In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its [[machinist]]s. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called ''Gold Streak'' with service to and from Alaska.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n[[File:Alaska Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 N958AS.jpg|thumb|alt=Right side view of an airplane taxiing on the ground towards left side of image.

In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]]. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===\n[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft on final approach with blue sky in the background.|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400]] landing at [[Vancouver International Airport]]]]\nThe airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400s]] from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.<ref name=\"1st B734 delivered\">{{cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|access-date=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the [[Russian Far East]], it added the cities of [[Magadan]] and [[Khabarovsk]], as well as service to [[Toronto]], its first Canadian city and the first city east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. However, Toronto was later dropped in 1992<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> and the Russian destinations in 1998.<ref name=\"Russia-flights-ended\" />\n\nAs the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also faced increased competition from [[low-cost carrier]]s. One carrier that competed with Alaska was [[MarkAir]]. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. Mark Air offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of {{US$|121}} million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth {{US$|2}} billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nThe cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to {{US$|45}} million and they made a {{US$|40}} million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline [[Southwest Airlines]] entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing [[Morris Air]]. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as \"the last great airline\" and with the motto \"For the same price, you just get more\", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/><ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994.<ref name=\"AS-retires-727s\" /> The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.<ref name=\"AS-Fleet-1996_FI\">{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html |publisher=[[Flight International]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996}}</ref>\n\nVecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Canada.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried [[automated external defibrillator]]s, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called \"Instant Travel Machines\" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter. An X-ray device, an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> This concept, known as \"Airport of the Future\" by the airline, was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub, and it drew attention from other airlines as well.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /> The airline would also become the first airline in the world to integrate [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[Ground proximity warning system|Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System]] (EGPWS) technology, adding a real-time, three-dimensional display of terrain. The system was operational in all the carrier's Boeing 737-400s by April 1999.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the carrier recording much profitability. The airline added new training and maintenance facilities.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Also, the airline began buying new 737s, ordering three [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-700|Boeing 737-700s]] and becoming the launch customer for the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-900|Boeing 737-900]] when it placed an order for ten of the jets in November 1997.<ref name=\"Launch customer for B737-900\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|title=Alaska Airlines Order Launches Boeing 737-900 Program|date=November 10, 1997|publisher=[[Boeing]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106182308/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|archivedate=November 6, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=July 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"737Order-1997_ST\">{{cite news|last=Lane |first=Polly |title=Boeing Gets $2 Billion In New Orders For Jets |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462 |access-date=July 4, 2012 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 10, 1997 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517022655/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Introducing flights across the U.S. (2000s)===\n[[File:B737-900 Alaska Seatac.JPG|thumb|left|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-900|Boeing 737-900]] at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport.

In 2005, due to the greater efficiency of the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] and rising costs for maintenance, fuel and crew training, Alaska Airlines decided to phase out the remaining 26 MD-80s and trained the pilots to fly the newer 737-800s that were being ordered to replace them. The last MD-80 flights took place on August 25, 2008.<ref name=\"md80 retired\" />\n\nAlaska also used eight [[Boeing 737#737-200|Boeing 737-200 Combi/QCs]] to suit the unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska. These [[combi aircraft]] operated with mixed load of passengers and freight on the main deck were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured (hence the moniker QC or \"Quick Change\") to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight. In the all-freight configuration, the 737-200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers, known as \"igloos.\" The palletized floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats.

In its report, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the [[horizontal stabilizer]]'s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident.

The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between [[Seattle]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] was awarded to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]].<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the [[Merrill Field|Anchorage airport]]. That year, the airline's name was changed to '''Alaska Star Airlines'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> The name '''Alaska Airlines''' was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name.<ref name=history_link /> In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.<ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3sMKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3671,3196652&dq=alaska-airlines+new+headquarters&hl=en Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief].

During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar]], its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Expansion after World War II (1945\u20131949)===\n[[File:DC-3 on ice colors adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of a silver Douglas DC-3 aircraft parked on snow-covered ground.|An Alaska Airlines Douglas DC-3, one of the aircraft purchased by the airline after World War II]]\nIn 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1947, jockey James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /><ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\"/> Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II. The airline purchased [[Douglas DC-3]]s, [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando]]s.<ref name=history_link /> Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nAlaska Airlines' large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to [[Paine Field]], an airport north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />  Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five [[Bell 47]]B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>\"Alaska Airlines\" by Cliff & Nancy Hollebeck, http://www.hollenbeckproductions.com</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of [[Yemen]] to [[Israel]] in what became known as [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000 mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from [[Eritrea]] to [[Aden]], then along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to [[Tel Aviv]]. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv in fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Magic Carpet|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/magic-carpet.aspx|website=AlaskaAir}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership (1950s)===\nAlaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, '''Collins Air Service''' and '''Al Jones Airways'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThough the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the [[Douglas DC-6]], the airline's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced \"Golden Nugget\" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Jet age (1960s)===\n[[File:Convair 880-61 Alaska AL in flight 1961.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Left side view of an aircraft in flight|The Convair 880 was Alaska Airlines' first jet aircraft.]]\nIn 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer [[Convair]] to purchase a [[Convair 880]] jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year. In 1966 the company received its first [[Boeing 727-100]] jets and removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters, in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight [[combi aircraft]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft</ref>  In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a [[Convair 990]] jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier [[Varig]] as PP-VJE which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100's which were then joined by stretched [[Boeing 727-200]]s which in turn became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules]] (L382 model), the civil version of the military [[C-130]] cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] and later to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Alaska also owned [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners including two [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner]]s from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049's which were used for [[Military Air Transport Service]] operations.<ref>[http://calclassic.com/starliner.htm California Classic Propliners \u2013 L-1649A Starliners]; Gibson, Tom \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N7316C.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N7316C c/n 1018]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N8083H.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N8083H c/n 1038]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref>  Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated, including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and Super [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[amphibian aircraft]] as well as two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the \"Turbo-Goose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm|website=timetableimages.com|title=June 1, 1967; June 1, 1969 & Sept. 14, 1970 Alaska Airlines system timetables}}</ref> The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] in 1968.\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-100 Alaska Airlines Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft parked on the tarmac, with a tree-covered hill as well as some clouds and buildings in the background|A Boeing 727-100 at [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]]. The airline introduced this type in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nDuring this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines such as [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Pan Am]] and [[Pacific Northern Airlines]], the latter being an Alaska-based air carrier operating [[Boeing 720]] jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]] in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated [[Boeing 747]] wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle\u2013Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle\u2013Fairbanks nonstop with the 747.  To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn December 1962 [[Air Guin\u00e9e]] signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two [[Douglas DC-4]]s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the [[Guinea]]n airline to Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"guttery\">{{cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to [[Wien Air Alaska]]. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional \"Gay Nineties\" theme with stewardesses dressed in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Economic hardship (1970s)===\n[[File:Boeing 727-200Adv Alaska Airlines Durand.jpg|thumb|alt=Left side view of an aircraft approaching an airport, with its nose pitched down slightly.

The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Alaska Airlines was also operating [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]] jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 aircraft at Anchorage (ANC) and Seattle (SEA)</ref>\n\nHowever, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name=history_link /> Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a [[Boeing 727-100]] jetliner [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866|crashed]] on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was {{US$|22}} million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of \"Elastic Airlines.\"<!--\"Elastic Airlines\" is mentioned in the source at the end of the paragraph.--> The logo was changed to an image of a smiling [[Eskimo]], which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Post-deregulation expansion (1978\u20131990)===\nAlaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]], knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor [[Wien Air Alaska]], but this ultimately failed, and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nAt the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US \u2014the city of Seattle\u2014, and it had only ten planes in its fleet.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], and it also introduced service to [[Palm Springs, California]]. [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] were added in 1981.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1979, Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with [[Hughes Air West]], however this never came to fruition. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[California]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in [[Idaho]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" />\n\nDeregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits and salaries. By 1979, competitors [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Western Airlines]] were both flying wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jets on the core Anchorage\u2013Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by [[Wien Air Alaska]] which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Anchorage schedules</ref>  Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks\u2013Seattle route at this time as well.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Fairbanks schedules</ref>  There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants.<ref name=history_link /> In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its [[machinist]]s. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called ''Gold Streak'' with service to and from Alaska.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n[[File:Alaska Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 N958AS.jpg|thumb|alt=Right side view of an airplane taxiing on the ground towards left side of image.

In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]]. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===\n[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft on final approach with blue sky in the background.|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400]] landing at [[Vancouver International Airport]]]]\nThe airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400s]] from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.<ref name=\"1st B734 delivered\">{{cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|access-date=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the [[Russian Far East]], it added the cities of [[Magadan]] and [[Khabarovsk]], as well as service to [[Toronto]], its first Canadian city and the first city east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. However, Toronto was later dropped in 1992<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> and the Russian destinations in 1998.<ref name=\"Russia-flights-ended\" />\n\nAs the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also faced increased competition from [[low-cost carrier]]s. One carrier that competed with Alaska was [[MarkAir]]. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. Mark Air offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of {{US$|121}} million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth {{US$|2}} billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nThe cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to {{US$|45}} million and they made a {{US$|40}} million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline [[Southwest Airlines]] entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing [[Morris Air]]. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as \"the last great airline\" and with the motto \"For the same price, you just get more\", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/><ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994.<ref name=\"AS-retires-727s\" /> The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.<ref name=\"AS-Fleet-1996_FI\">{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html |publisher=[[Flight International]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996}}</ref>\n\nVecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Canada.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried [[automated external defibrillator]]s, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called \"Instant Travel Machines\" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter.

In its report, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the [[horizontal stabilizer]]'s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident.

The name of this language is spelled ''Yup'ik'', with an apostrophe that specifies the elongated 'p' in the way ''Yupik'' is pronounced; all the other languages are spelled ''Yupik'', but all are pronounced the same.  Of the about 21,000 Central Alaskan Yup'ik, some 13,000 still speak this language. There are several dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik. The largest dialect, General Central Yup'ik or ''Yugtun'', is spoken in the [[Yukon River]], [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]], [[Kuskokwim River]], and [[Bristol Bay]] areas. There are three other Central Alaskan Yup'ik dialects: [[Norton Sound]], [[Hooper Bay]]/[[Chevak, Alaska|Chevak]], and [[Nunivak Island]] (called ''[[Chevak Cup\u2019ik language|Cup\u2019ik]]'' or ''[[Cup'ig language|Cup'ig]]'').

The Languages of Native North America. Cambridge University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\n====Stress====\nThe [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern of Central Siberian and Central Alaskan is generally [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]]ic where stress occurs on the second syllable of each two-syllable [[metrical foot]]. This can be seen in words consisting of [[Syllable weight#Syllable weight in linguistics|light (L)]] syllables. Here, the parsing of syllables into feet is represented with parentheses:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"6\"\n| (L''''L''')L || qay\u00e1ni || || (qa.y\u00e1).ni || \"his own kayak\"\n|}\n\nAs can be seen above, the footing of a Yupik word starts from the left edge of the word. (Therefore, a foot parsing of ''L(L''''L''')(L''''L''')'' is not permitted.) Syllables that cannot be parsed into feet in words with an odd number of syllables are not stressed. (Thus, a parsing of ''(L''''L''')(''''L''')'' is impossible.)\n\nAdditionally, heavy (H) syllables (consisting of two [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]]) are obligatorily stressed:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"6\"\n| (L''''H''')L || qay\u00e1:ni || || (qa.y\u00e1:).ni || \"in another's kayak\"\n|}\n\nHowever, there is a restriction against stress falling on the final syllable of a phrase:\n\n: (L''''L''')(L''''L''') (phrase-internal)\n: (L''''L''')LL (phrase-final)\n\nStressed syllables undergo phonetic lengthening in Yupik although the details differ from dialect to dialect. Generally, a foot consisting of light CV syllables will have the stressed vowel at a greater length than the unstressed vowel. That can be analyzed as light syllables changing to heavy under stress:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"6\" style=\"line-height: 1.1em;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| (L''''L''')L<br />(qay\u00e1:)ni || \u2192 || (L''''H''')L<br />[qay\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| (L''''L''')(''''H''')L<br />saguy\u00e1:ni || \u2192 || (L''''H''')(''''H''')L<br />[sag\u00fa:y\u00e1:ni]<br />[(sa.g\u00fa:).(y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's drum\"\n|}\n\nBoth Central Siberian and Central Alaskan Yup'ik show this iambic lengthening of light syllables.\n\nWhen the stressed syllable is underlyingly heavy (such as ''LHL)''), there is dialectal variation. The Chaplinski variety of Central Siberian Yupik shows no extra lengthening of the already long vowel: the heavy syllables remain heavy (no change). The St. Lawrence variety of Central Siberian Yupik has further iambic overlengthening, resulting in a change from underlying heavy to a phonetically superheavy syllable (S). In those cases, Central Alaskan Yup'ik changes the first light syllable in what would be a (LH) foot to a heavy syllable which then receives stress. The light to heavy shift is realized as consonant gemination (of the onset) in CV syllables and as consonantal lengthening of the coda in CVC syllables:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"line-height: 1.1em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| Chaplinski: || LHL<br />/qaya:ni/ || \u2192 || (L''''H''')L<br />[qay\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\" || (no change)\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"\n| St. Lawrence: || LHL<br />/qaya:ni/ || \u2192 || (L''''S''')L<br />[qay\u00e1::ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1::).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\" || (overlengthening)\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"\n| Central Alaskan: || LHL<br />/qaya:ni/ || \u2192 || (''''H''')(''''H''')L<br />[qayy\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qay.y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\" || (gemination)\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| || LLLHL<br /> || \u2192 || (L''''H''')(''''H''')(''''H''')L<br />[qay\u00e1:p\u00edx:k\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1:).(p\u00edx:).(k\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's future authentic kayak\" || (consonant lengthening)\n|}\n\nNote that in the Chaplinski variety because of iambic lengthening there is a neutralization of vowel length contrast in nonfinal stressed syllables.\n\n==Morphology==\nThe Yupik languages, like other Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages, represent a particular type of [[agglutinative language]] called an ''affixally [[polysynthetic language]]''.\n\nYupik languages \"synthesize\" a single [[root (linguistics)|root]] at the beginning of every word with various grammatical [[suffix]]es to create long words with sentence-like meanings. Within the vocabulary of Yupik there are no more than two thousand roots and around four hundred lexical suffixes, but they can be combined to create meanings that in most languages are expressed by multiple free [[morpheme]]s.\n\nAlthough every Yupik word contains ''one and only one root'' that is rigidly constrained to word-initial position, the ordering of the suffixes that follow can be varied to communicate different meanings, principally through [[recursion]]. The only exception lies with [[grammatical case|case]] suffixes on nouns and [[grammatical person|person]] suffixes on verbs, which are restricted to the end of the words in which they occur.\n\nYupik is an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative language]] both in nominal and verbal morphology. It has obligatory [[polyagreement]] on all verbs with subject and object but not with the theme of a [[ditransitive verb]].\n\n== Writing systems ==\nThe Yupik languages were not written until the arrival of Europeans around the beginning of the 19th century. The earliest efforts at writing Yupik were those of missionaries who, with their Yupik-speaking assistants, translated the Bible and other religious texts into Yupik. Such efforts as those of [[Saint Innocent of Alaska]], Reverend John Hinz (see [[John Henry Kilbuck]]) and [[Uyaquk]] had the limited goals of transmitting religious beliefs in written form.<ref>For example, [http://www.asna.ca/alaska/ Alaskan Orthodox texts] in [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]] and [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]] (cf. [http://www.archdiocese.ca/articles/alaskan-orthodox-texts-project-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary The Alaskan Orthodox Texts Project celebrates its 10th anniversary], May 2015)</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Alaskan [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted a Latin alphabet originally developed by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries in [[Greenland]] beginning in the 1760s, which the missionaries later transported to [[Labrador]]. The Alaskans were the only Northern indigenous peoples to develop their own form of picture writing.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html Project Naming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028155138/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html |date=2006-10-28 }}, the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\nAfter the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased]] Alaska, Yupik children were taught to write English with Latin letters in the public schools. Some were also taught the Yupik script developed by Rev. Hinz, which used Latin letters, which had become the most widespread method for writing Yupik. In Russia, most Yupik were taught to read and write only Russian, but a few scholars wrote Yupik using Cyrillic letters.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[University of Alaska]] assembled a group of scholars and native Yupik speakers who developed a script to replace the Hinz writing system. One of the goals of this script was that it could be input from an English keyboard without diacritics or extra letters. Another requirement was that it accurately represent each [[phoneme]] in the language with a distinct letter. A few features of the script are that it uses 'q' for the back version of 'k', 'r' for the Yupik sound that resembles the French 'r', and consonant + ' for a geminated (lengthened) consonant. The rhythmic doubling of vowels (except schwa) in every second consecutive open syllable is not indicated in the orthography unless it comes at the end of a word.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Campbell, Lyle.

Most of the 1,000 Yupiks on St. Lawrence Island still speak the St. Lawrence dialect of this language. About 300 of the 1,000 Siberian Yupiks in Russia still speak the Chaplino dialect of this language.\n#'''[[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]]''' (also '''Central Yup'ik''', '''Yup'ik''', '''West Alaska Eskimo'''): spoken on the Alaska mainland from [[Norton Sound]] down to the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on some islands such as [[Nunivak Island|Nunivak]]. The name of this language is spelled ''Yup'ik'', with an apostrophe that specifies the elongated 'p' in the way ''Yupik'' is pronounced; all the other languages are spelled ''Yupik'', but all are pronounced the same.  Of the about 21,000 Central Alaskan Yup'ik, some 13,000 still speak this language. There are several dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik. The largest dialect, General Central Yup'ik or ''Yugtun'', is spoken in the [[Yukon River]], [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]], [[Kuskokwim River]], and [[Bristol Bay]] areas. There are three other Central Alaskan Yup'ik dialects: [[Norton Sound]], [[Hooper Bay]]/[[Chevak, Alaska|Chevak]], and [[Nunivak Island]] (called ''[[Chevak Cup\u2019ik language|Cup\u2019ik]]'' or ''[[Cup'ig language|Cup'ig]]'').

That can be analyzed as light syllables changing to heavy under stress:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"6\" style=\"line-height: 1.1em;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| (L''''L''')L<br />(qay\u00e1:)ni || \u2192 || (L''''H''')L<br />[qay\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| (L''''L''')(''''H''')L<br />saguy\u00e1:ni || \u2192 || (L''''H''')(''''H''')L<br />[sag\u00fa:y\u00e1:ni]<br />[(sa.g\u00fa:).(y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's drum\"\n|}\n\nBoth Central Siberian and Central Alaskan Yup'ik show this iambic lengthening of light syllables.\n\nWhen the stressed syllable is underlyingly heavy (such as ''LHL)''), there is dialectal variation. The Chaplinski variety of Central Siberian Yupik shows no extra lengthening of the already long vowel: the heavy syllables remain heavy (no change). The St. Lawrence variety of Central Siberian Yupik has further iambic overlengthening, resulting in a change from underlying heavy to a phonetically superheavy syllable (S). In those cases, Central Alaskan Yup'ik changes the first light syllable in what would be a (LH) foot to a heavy syllable which then receives stress. The light to heavy shift is realized as consonant gemination (of the onset) in CV syllables and as consonantal lengthening of the coda in CVC syllables:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"line-height: 1.1em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| Chaplinski: || LHL<br />/qaya:ni/ || \u2192 || (L''''H''')L<br />[qay\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\" || (no change)\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"\n| St. Lawrence: || LHL<br />/qaya:ni/ || \u2192 || (L''''S''')L<br />[qay\u00e1::ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1::).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\" || (overlengthening)\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"\n| Central Alaskan: || LHL<br />/qaya:ni/ || \u2192 || (''''H''')(''''H''')L<br />[qayy\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qay.y\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's kayak\" || (gemination)\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| || LLLHL<br /> || \u2192 || (L''''H''')(''''H''')(''''H''')L<br />[qay\u00e1:p\u00edx:k\u00e1:ni]<br />[(qa.y\u00e1:).(p\u00edx:).(k\u00e1:).ni] || <br />\"in another's future authentic kayak\" || (consonant lengthening)\n|}\n\nNote that in the Chaplinski variety because of iambic lengthening there is a neutralization of vowel length contrast in nonfinal stressed syllables.\n\n==Morphology==\nThe Yupik languages, like other Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages, represent a particular type of [[agglutinative language]] called an ''affixally [[polysynthetic language]]''.\n\nYupik languages \"synthesize\" a single [[root (linguistics)|root]] at the beginning of every word with various grammatical [[suffix]]es to create long words with sentence-like meanings. Within the vocabulary of Yupik there are no more than two thousand roots and around four hundred lexical suffixes, but they can be combined to create meanings that in most languages are expressed by multiple free [[morpheme]]s.\n\nAlthough every Yupik word contains ''one and only one root'' that is rigidly constrained to word-initial position, the ordering of the suffixes that follow can be varied to communicate different meanings, principally through [[recursion]]. The only exception lies with [[grammatical case|case]] suffixes on nouns and [[grammatical person|person]] suffixes on verbs, which are restricted to the end of the words in which they occur.\n\nYupik is an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative language]] both in nominal and verbal morphology. It has obligatory [[polyagreement]] on all verbs with subject and object but not with the theme of a [[ditransitive verb]].\n\n== Writing systems ==\nThe Yupik languages were not written until the arrival of Europeans around the beginning of the 19th century. The earliest efforts at writing Yupik were those of missionaries who, with their Yupik-speaking assistants, translated the Bible and other religious texts into Yupik. Such efforts as those of [[Saint Innocent of Alaska]], Reverend John Hinz (see [[John Henry Kilbuck]]) and [[Uyaquk]] had the limited goals of transmitting religious beliefs in written form.<ref>For example, [http://www.asna.ca/alaska/ Alaskan Orthodox texts] in [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]] and [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]] (cf. [http://www.archdiocese.ca/articles/alaskan-orthodox-texts-project-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary The Alaskan Orthodox Texts Project celebrates its 10th anniversary], May 2015)</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Alaskan [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted a Latin alphabet originally developed by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries in [[Greenland]] beginning in the 1760s, which the missionaries later transported to [[Labrador]]. The Alaskans were the only Northern indigenous peoples to develop their own form of picture writing.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html Project Naming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028155138/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html |date=2006-10-28 }}, the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\nAfter the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased]] Alaska, Yupik children were taught to write English with Latin letters in the public schools. Some were also taught the Yupik script developed by Rev. Hinz, which used Latin letters, which had become the most widespread method for writing Yupik. In Russia, most Yupik were taught to read and write only Russian, but a few scholars wrote Yupik using Cyrillic letters.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[University of Alaska]] assembled a group of scholars and native Yupik speakers who developed a script to replace the Hinz writing system. One of the goals of this script was that it could be input from an English keyboard without diacritics or extra letters. Another requirement was that it accurately represent each [[phoneme]] in the language with a distinct letter. A few features of the script are that it uses 'q' for the back version of 'k', 'r' for the Yupik sound that resembles the French 'r', and consonant + ' for a geminated (lengthened) consonant. The rhythmic doubling of vowels (except schwa) in every second consecutive open syllable is not indicated in the orthography unless it comes at the end of a word.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Campbell, Lyle.

In [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] and the old IUPAC systems it was called '''Group V<small>A</small>''' and '''Group V<small>B</small>''' respectively (pronounced \"group five A\" and \"group five B\", \"V\" for the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] 5).<ref name=Fluck1988>{{cite journal|last=Fluck|first=E|title=New notations in the periodic table |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=431\u20136 |year=1988 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |doi=10.1351/pac198860030431}}</ref> In the field of [[semiconductor]] physics, it is still usually called '''Group V'''.<ref name=Adachi2005>{{cite book |editor-last=Adachi |editor-first=S. |title=Properties of Group-IV, III-V and II-VI Semiconductors |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |year=2005 |isbn=978-0470090329 |series=Wiley Series in Materials for Electronic & Optoelectronic Applications |volume=15 |bibcode=2005pgii.book.....A}}</ref> The \"five\" (\"V\") in the historical names comes from the \"[[valence (chemistry)|pentavalency]]\" of nitrogen, reflected by the [[stoichiometry]] of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] such as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.

They are therefore 3&nbsp;electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-[[ion]]ized state. The Russell\u2013Saunders [[term symbol]] of the ground state in all elements in the group is <sup>4</sup>S<sub>{{frac|3|2}}</sub>.\n\nThe most important elements of this group are ''[[nitrogen]]'' (N), which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air, and ''[[phosphorus]]'' (P), which, like nitrogen, is essential to all known forms of life.\n\n====Compounds====\n<!-- For those who are considering expanding this section, I recommend reading the first paragraph of [[Moscovium#Chemical]], which is a good summary of the chemical behavior of the entire group, first. -->\nBinary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as '''pnictides'''. Pnictide compounds tend to be [[exotic compound|exotic]]. Various properties that some pnictides have include being [[diamagnetic]] and [[paramagnetic]] at room temperature, being transparent, and generating electricity when heated. Other pnictides include the ternary rare-earth main-group variety of pnictides. These are in the form of RE<sub>a</sub>M<sub>b</sub>Pn<sub>c</sub>, where M is a [[carbon group]] or [[boron group]] element and Pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen. These compounds are between [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties.<ref name=\"chm.bris.ac.uk\">[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/pnictogen/pnictogenh.htm \"Pnicogen \u2013 Molecule of the Month\"]. University of Bristol</ref>\n\nThese elements are also noted for their [[chemical stability|stability]] in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple [[covalent bond]]s. This is the property of these elements which leads to their potential [[toxicity]], most evident in phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of the body, they create strong [[free radicals]] not easily processed by the liver, where they accumulate.  Paradoxically, it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth's reduced toxicity (when in molecules), as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split, creating very unreactive molecules. For example, N<sub>2</sub>, the [[diatomic]] form of nitrogen, is used as an inert gas in situations where using [[argon]] or another [[noble gas]] would be too expensive.\n\nFormation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their ''five'' valence electrons whereas the [[octet rule]] permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding. Because 5&nbsp;{{abbr|>|greater than}}&nbsp;3, it leaves unused two electrons in a [[lone pair]] unless there is a positive charge around (like in [[ammonium|{{chem2|NH4+}}]]). When a pnictogen forms only three [[single bond]]s, effects of the lone pair typically result in [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\n====Oxidation states====\nThe light pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic) tend to form \u22123 charges when reduced, completing their octet. When oxidized or ionized, pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 (by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell) or +5 (by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell). However heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabalised.<ref name=Boudreaux>Boudreaux, Kevin A.

Going down the group, to [[phosphane]] (phosphine), [[arsane]] (arsine), [[stibane]] (stibine), and finally [[bismuthane]] (bismuthine), each pnictogen hydride becomes progressively less stable/more unstable, more toxic, and has a smaller hydrogen-hydrogen angle (from 107.8\u00b0 in ammonia<ref>{{cite book |last=Greenwood |first= N.N. |last2= Earnshaw |first2=A. | title=Chemistry of the Elements |edition = 2nd | location=Oxford | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann | year=1997 | isbn=0-7506-3365-4 | page = 423 }}</ref> to 90.48\u00b0 in bismuthane<ref>{{ cite journal | journal = Angew.

(Also, technically, only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the \u22123 oxidation state because for the rest, the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen.)\n\nCrystal solids featuring pnictogens fully reduced include [[yttrium nitride]], [[calcium phosphide]], [[sodium arsenide]], [[indium antimonide]], and even [[double salt]]s like [[aluminium gallium indium phosphide]]. These include [[III-V_semiconductors]], including [[gallium arsenide]], the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon.\n\n=====+3 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrite|phosphite|arsenite|antimonite|bismuthite}}\nNitrogen forms a limited number of stable III compounds. [[Nitrogen(III) oxide]] can only be isolated at low temperatures, and [[nitrous acid]] is unstable. [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] is the only stable nitrogen trihalide, with [[nitrogen trichloride]], [[nitrogen tribromide]] and [[nitrogen triiodide]] being explosive\u2014nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it. Phosphorus forms [[Phosphorus trioxide|a +III oxide]] which is stable at room temperature, [[phosphorous acid]], and [[Phosphorus_halide#Oxidation_state_+3_(PX3)|several trihalides]], although the triiodide is unstable. Arsenic forms +III compounds with oxygen as [[arsenite]]s, [[arsenous acid]], and [[arsenic(III) oxide]], and it forms all four trihalides. Antimony forms [[Antimony trioxide|antimony(III) oxide]] and [[antimonite]] but not oxyacids. Its trihalides, [[antimony trifluoride]], [[antimony trichloride]], [[antimony tribromide]], and [[antimony triiodide]], like all pnictogen trihalides, each have [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\nThe +3 oxidation state is bismuth's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic properties on heavier elements]], effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium. Bismuth(III) forms [[Bismuth(III) oxide|an oxide]], [[Bismuth oxychloride|an oxychloride]], [[Bismuth oxynitrate|an oxynitrate]], and [[Bismuth(III) sulfide|a sulfide]]. Moscovium(III) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth(III). Moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides, of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water.<!-- Could someone please copy the BFricke reference from [[moscovium]]? I couldn't find the defining instance. --> It is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +III oxidation state.\n\n=====+5 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrate|phosphate|arsenate|antimonate|bismuthate}}\nFor nitrogen, the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like [[dinitrogen pentoxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]], as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly.{{clarify|date=August 2019}} Pnictogen compounds with [[coordination number]]&nbsp;5 are [[hypervalent molecule|hypervalent]]. [[Nitrogen pentafluoride|Nitrogen(V) fluoride]] is only theoretical and has not been synthesized. The \"true\" +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]], as shown in their oxides, [[phosphorus(V) oxide]], [[arsenic(V) oxide]], and [[antimony(V) oxide]], and their fluorides, [[phosphorus pentafluoride|phosphorus(V) fluoride]], [[arsenic pentafluoride|arsenic(V) fluoride]], [[antimony pentafluoride|antimony(V) fluoride]]. At least two also form related fluoride-anions, [[hexafluorophosphate]] and [[hexafluoroantimonate]], that function as [[non-coordinating anions]]. Phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides, known as [[oxyhalides]], like [[phosphorus oxychloride]], and mixed pentahalides, like [[phosphorus trifluorodichloride]]. Pentamethylpnictogen(V) compounds exist for [[Pentamethylarsenic|arsenic]], [[Pentamethylantimony|antimony]], and [[Pentamethylbismuth|bismuth]]. However, for bismuth, the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic stabilization]] of the 6s orbitals known as the [[inert pair effect]], so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. This causes [[bismuth(V) oxide]] to be unstable<ref>{{cite book | title = Concise encyclopedia chemistry | url = https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00eagl | url-access = registration | first1 = Thomas|last1 = Scott | first2 = Mary|last2 = Eagleson | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | date = 1994 | isbn = 978-3-11-011451-5 | page = [https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00eagl/page/136 136]}}</ref> and [[bismuth pentafluoride|bismuth(V) fluoride]] to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides, making it an extremely powerful [[fluorinating agent]].<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|pages=561\u2013563}}</ref> This effect is even more pronounced for moscovium, prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state.\n\n=====Other oxidation states=====\n* Nitrogen forms [[Nitrogen oxide|a variety of compounds with oxygen]] in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states, including +II, +IV, and even some [[mixed-valence compound]]s and very unstable [[nitrate radical|+VI]] oxidation state.\n* In [[hydrazine]], [[diphosphane]], and organic derivatives of the two, the nitrogen/phosphorus atoms have the \u22122 oxidation state. Likewise, [[diimide]], which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other, and [[Diazene|its organic derivatives]] have nitrogen in the oxidation state of \u22121.\n** Similarly, [[realgar]] has arsenic-arsenic bonds, so the arsenic's oxidation state is +II.\n** A corresponding compound for antimony is Sb<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, where the antimony's oxidation state is +II.\n* Phosphorus has the +1 oxidation state in [[hypophosphorous acid]] and the +4 oxidation state in [[hypophosphoric acid]].\n* [[Antimony tetroxide]] is a [[mixed-valence compound]], where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state.\n* It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons, as the [[binding energy]] of the lone 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons. This is predicted to cause +I to be a common oxidation state for moscovium, although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=O.

They are therefore 3&nbsp;electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-[[ion]]ized state. The Russell\u2013Saunders [[term symbol]] of the ground state in all elements in the group is <sup>4</sup>S<sub>{{frac|3|2}}</sub>.\n\nThe most important elements of this group are ''[[nitrogen]]'' (N), which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air, and ''[[phosphorus]]'' (P), which, like nitrogen, is essential to all known forms of life.\n\n====Compounds====\n<!-- For those who are considering expanding this section, I recommend reading the first paragraph of [[Moscovium#Chemical]], which is a good summary of the chemical behavior of the entire group, first. -->\nBinary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as '''pnictides'''. Pnictide compounds tend to be [[exotic compound|exotic]]. Various properties that some pnictides have include being [[diamagnetic]] and [[paramagnetic]] at room temperature, being transparent, and generating electricity when heated. Other pnictides include the ternary rare-earth main-group variety of pnictides. These are in the form of RE<sub>a</sub>M<sub>b</sub>Pn<sub>c</sub>, where M is a [[carbon group]] or [[boron group]] element and Pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen. These compounds are between [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties.<ref name=\"chm.bris.ac.uk\">[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/pnictogen/pnictogenh.htm \"Pnicogen \u2013 Molecule of the Month\"]. University of Bristol</ref>\n\nThese elements are also noted for their [[chemical stability|stability]] in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple [[covalent bond]]s. This is the property of these elements which leads to their potential [[toxicity]], most evident in phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of the body, they create strong [[free radicals]] not easily processed by the liver, where they accumulate.  Paradoxically, it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth's reduced toxicity (when in molecules), as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split, creating very unreactive molecules. For example, N<sub>2</sub>, the [[diatomic]] form of nitrogen, is used as an inert gas in situations where using [[argon]] or another [[noble gas]] would be too expensive.\n\nFormation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their ''five'' valence electrons whereas the [[octet rule]] permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding. Because 5&nbsp;{{abbr|>|greater than}}&nbsp;3, it leaves unused two electrons in a [[lone pair]] unless there is a positive charge around (like in [[ammonium|{{chem2|NH4+}}]]). When a pnictogen forms only three [[single bond]]s, effects of the lone pair typically result in [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\n====Oxidation states====\nThe light pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic) tend to form \u22123 charges when reduced, completing their octet. When oxidized or ionized, pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 (by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell) or +5 (by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell). However heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabalised.<ref name=Boudreaux>Boudreaux, Kevin A.

These include [[III-V_semiconductors]], including [[gallium arsenide]], the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon.\n\n=====+3 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrite|phosphite|arsenite|antimonite|bismuthite}}\nNitrogen forms a limited number of stable III compounds. [[Nitrogen(III) oxide]] can only be isolated at low temperatures, and [[nitrous acid]] is unstable. [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] is the only stable nitrogen trihalide, with [[nitrogen trichloride]], [[nitrogen tribromide]] and [[nitrogen triiodide]] being explosive\u2014nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it. Phosphorus forms [[Phosphorus trioxide|a +III oxide]] which is stable at room temperature, [[phosphorous acid]], and [[Phosphorus_halide#Oxidation_state_+3_(PX3)|several trihalides]], although the triiodide is unstable. Arsenic forms +III compounds with oxygen as [[arsenite]]s, [[arsenous acid]], and [[arsenic(III) oxide]], and it forms all four trihalides. Antimony forms [[Antimony trioxide|antimony(III) oxide]] and [[antimonite]] but not oxyacids. Its trihalides, [[antimony trifluoride]], [[antimony trichloride]], [[antimony tribromide]], and [[antimony triiodide]], like all pnictogen trihalides, each have [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\nThe +3 oxidation state is bismuth's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic properties on heavier elements]], effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium. Bismuth(III) forms [[Bismuth(III) oxide|an oxide]], [[Bismuth oxychloride|an oxychloride]], [[Bismuth oxynitrate|an oxynitrate]], and [[Bismuth(III) sulfide|a sulfide]]. Moscovium(III) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth(III). Moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides, of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water.<!-- Could someone please copy the BFricke reference from [[moscovium]]? I couldn't find the defining instance. --> It is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +III oxidation state.\n\n=====+5 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrate|phosphate|arsenate|antimonate|bismuthate}}\nFor nitrogen, the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like [[dinitrogen pentoxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]], as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly.{{clarify|date=August 2019}} Pnictogen compounds with [[coordination number]]&nbsp;5 are [[hypervalent molecule|hypervalent]]. [[Nitrogen pentafluoride|Nitrogen(V) fluoride]] is only theoretical and has not been synthesized. The \"true\" +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]], as shown in their oxides, [[phosphorus(V) oxide]], [[arsenic(V) oxide]], and [[antimony(V) oxide]], and their fluorides, [[phosphorus pentafluoride|phosphorus(V) fluoride]], [[arsenic pentafluoride|arsenic(V) fluoride]], [[antimony pentafluoride|antimony(V) fluoride]]. At least two also form related fluoride-anions, [[hexafluorophosphate]] and [[hexafluoroantimonate]], that function as [[non-coordinating anions]]. Phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides, known as [[oxyhalides]], like [[phosphorus oxychloride]], and mixed pentahalides, like [[phosphorus trifluorodichloride]]. Pentamethylpnictogen(V) compounds exist for [[Pentamethylarsenic|arsenic]], [[Pentamethylantimony|antimony]], and [[Pentamethylbismuth|bismuth]]. However, for bismuth, the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic stabilization]] of the 6s orbitals known as the [[inert pair effect]], so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically.

All the elements in the group are [[solid]]s at [[room temperature]], except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature. Nitrogen and bismuth, despite both being pnictogens, are very different in their physical properties.  For instance, at STP nitrogen is a transparent nonmetallic gas, while bismuth is a silvery-white metal.<ref name = \"The Elements\"/>\n\nThe [[density|densities]] of the pnictogens increase towards the heavier pnictogens. Nitrogen's density is 0.001251 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP]].<ref name = \"The Elements\"/> Phosphorus's density is 1.82 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at STP, arsenic's is 5.72 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, antimony's is 6.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and bismuth's is 9.79 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name = \"Periodic Table Advanced\">{{Citation|last = Jackson|first = Mark|title = Periodic Table Advanced|year = 2001|isbn=1572225424}}</ref>\n\nNitrogen's [[melting point]] is \u2212210&nbsp;\u00b0C and its boiling point is \u2212196&nbsp;\u00b0C.

In the 1760s two scientists, [[Henry Cavendish]] and [[Joseph Priestley]], isolated nitrogen from air, but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element. It was not until several years later, in 1772, that [[Daniel Rutherford]] realized that the gas was indeed nitrogen.<ref name = \"Emsley\">{{Citation|last = Emsley|first = John|title = Nature's Building Blocks|year = 2011|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}</ref>\n\nThe scientist [[Hennig Brandt]] first discovered phosphorus in Hamburg in 1669. Brandt produced the element by heating evaporated urine and condensing the resulting phosphorus vapor in water. Brandt initially thought that he had discovered the [[Philosopher's Stone]], but eventually realized that this was not the case.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nArsenic compounds have been known for at least 5000 years, and the ancient Greek [[Theophrastus]] recognized the arsenic minerals called [[realgar]] and [[orpiment]]. Elemental arsenic was discovered in the 13th century by [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nAntimony was well known to the ancients. A 5000-year-old vase made of nearly pure antimony exists in the [[Louvre]]. Antimony compounds were used in dyes in the [[Babylon]]ian times. The antimony mineral [[stibnite]] may have been a component of [[Greek fire]].<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nBismuth was first discovered by an [[alchemy|alchemist]] in 1400. Within 80 years of bismuth's discovery, it had applications in [[printing]] and decorated [[caskets]]. The [[Incas]] were also using bismuth in knives by 1500. Bismuth was originally thought to be the same as lead, but in 1753, [[Claude Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy]] proved that bismuth was different from lead.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nMoscovium was successfully produced in 2003 by bombarding [[americium-243]] atoms with [[calcium-48]] atoms.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\n===Names and etymology===\nThe term ''pnictogen'' (or ''pnigogen'') is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''pn\u00edgein'') meaning \"to choke\", referring to the choking or stifling property of nitrogen gas.<ref name=Girolami2009>{{cite journal|last=Girolami|first=GS|title=Origin of the Terms Pnictogen and Pnictide|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=86|issue=10|pages=1200\u20131|year=2009|doi=10.1021/ed086p1200|bibcode=2009JChEd..86.1200G}}</ref> It can also be used as a [[mnemonic]] for the two most common members, P and N.

If the ore contains 45% to 60% antimony by weight, antimony is obtained by heating the ore, also known as liquidation.

His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to study the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.<ref name=\"Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99\">''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67\u201399</ref> An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex. In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.\n\n[[File:Expo 1931 Angkor nuit.jpg|thumb|left|The grand replica of Angkor Wat in Paris Colonial Exposition 1931, represent the immense grandeur of French colony; the [[French protectorate of Cambodia]].]]\nThe 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Glaize p. 59.</ref> Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple.

Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\"/>\n\n====Central structure====\n[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]\nThe temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].<ref name=\"Ohio\" /> Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer =\n| align = right\n| image1 = Angkor Wat Tempel 34.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The central tower symbolizes the sacred [[Mount Meru]].\n| link1 =\n| image2 = Awatcornertower01.JPG\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =One of the four corner towers of Angkor Wat\n| link2 =\n}}\n\nThe outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the \"Hall of a Thousand Gods\"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.<ref>Glaize p. 63.</ref> North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].\n\n[[File:Angkor (IV).jpg|thumb|left|View of the outer gallery of Angkor Wat]]\nBeyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].<ref>Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.</ref> Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery.

The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or [[garuda]]s. Carved [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintels and pediments]] decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.\nThe tower above the central shrine rises {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a height of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four.<ref>Briggs p. 199.</ref> The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]], the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouv\u00e9 excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of [[gold leaf]] two metres above ground level.<ref>Glaize p. 65.</ref>\n\n====Decoration====\n[[File:Angkor Wat - 047 Apsaras (8581709930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devatas]] are characteristic of the Angkor Wat style.]]\nIntegrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of [[bas-relief]] friezes.

His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to study the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.<ref name=\"Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99\">''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67\u201399</ref> An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex. In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.\n\n[[File:Expo 1931 Angkor nuit.jpg|thumb|left|The grand replica of Angkor Wat in Paris Colonial Exposition 1931, represent the immense grandeur of French colony; the [[French protectorate of Cambodia]].]]\nThe 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Glaize p. 59.</ref> Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple.

By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural [[resin]]s or [[slaked lime]] has been suggested.<ref>[http://www.gacp-angkor.de/ German Apsara Conservation Project] Building Techniques, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple \"attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style.\"<ref>Glaize p. 25.</ref>\n\nArchitecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.<ref>APSARA authority, [http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/angkor/art/styles/angkorian/angkor_vat.html Angkor Vat Style]</ref> Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including [[gilding|gilded]] [[stucco]] on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.<ref>Freeman and Jacques p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Features===\n\n====Outer enclosure====\n[[File:Buddhist Monk at Angkor Wat 1.jpg|thumb|left|View of the gates and west wall of the outer enclosure of Angkor Wat from accross the moat]]\nThe outer wall, {{convert|1024|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, is surrounded by a {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} apron of open ground and a moat {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and over 5 kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) in perimeter.<ref name=Jarus2018 /> The moat extends 1.5 kilometres from east to west and 1.3 kilometres from north to south.<ref name=\"Angkor Wat: An Introduction\">{{cite journal |last1=Fletcher |first=Roland |first2=Damian |last2=Evans |first3=Christophe |last3=Pottier |first4=Chhay |last4=Rachna |title=Angkor Wat: An introduction |journal=Antiquity |date=December 2015 |volume=89 |issue=348 |page=1395 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2015.178 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286412358_Angkor_Wat_An_introduction |access-date=March 27, 2020 |via=ResearchGate}}</ref> Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.<ref name=\"multiref4\">Freeman and Jacques p. 49.</ref> There are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gopura|gopuras]] at each of the [[cardinal point]]s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers.

These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]], including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.\n\n[[File:Angkor Wat 005.jpg|thumb|right|Northern library]]\nThe outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\">Freeman and Jacques p. 50.</ref> Most of the area is now covered by forest.

Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\"/>\n\n====Central structure====\n[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]\nThe temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].<ref name=\"Ohio\" /> Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer =\n| align = right\n| image1 = Angkor Wat Tempel 34.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The central tower symbolizes the sacred [[Mount Meru]].\n| link1 =\n| image2 = Awatcornertower01.JPG\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =One of the four corner towers of Angkor Wat\n| link2 =\n}}\n\nThe outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the \"Hall of a Thousand Gods\"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.<ref>Glaize p. 63.</ref> North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].\n\n[[File:Angkor (IV).jpg|thumb|left|View of the outer gallery of Angkor Wat]]\nBeyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].<ref>Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.</ref> Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery.

In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County.

A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

Located on [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. It [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]]. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 23,132.\n\n==Toponymy==\n\"Mequon\" may have come from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.<ref>\"[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm \"Yankee Settler's Cottage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420074506/http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm |date=2006-04-20}} [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website</ref> Alternatively, the name may come from a [[Menominee language|Menominee]] word ''M\u0113kon'', meaning \"feather.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The 1839 [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County.

It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt.

A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC., there was thought to be over 5,000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4,000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the [[Anapo]] river with its tributary, the [[Calcinara]], about {{cvt|23|km}} northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n\n==Geography==\n'''Pantalica''' is located on a limestone promontory surrounded by a deep gorge formed by the [[Anapo]] and [[Calcinara]] rivers between the towns of [[Ferla]] and [[Sortino]] in south-eastern [[Sicily]]. In addition to its archaeological interest it is an important nature reserve (Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica), with a variety of local flora and fauna and natural caves (notably the Grotta dei Pipistrelli (Bat Cave)). Various pathways facilitate visitor access, including a disused railway track (dismantled in 1956) along the Anapo valley bottom. The promontory can be accessed directly by car from Ferla, or by walking down the old mule track from the parking place on the road from Sortino and crossing over the Calcinara stream.\n\n[[File:Pantalica1770.jpg|thumb|Square rock-cut tombs in Pantalica]]\n[[File:Pantalica1757.jpg|thumb|Tomb entrance in Pantalica]]\n\n==History==\nIn the 13th century BC, some Sicilian coastal settlements were abandoned, possibly due to the arrival of the [[Sicels]] on the island and the onset of more unsettled conditions. New large sites, like Pantalica, appeared in the hilly coastal hinterlands, probably chosen for defensive reasons.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nPantalica evidently flourished for about 600 years, from about 1250 to 650 BC. The current name of the site probably dates from the Early Middle Ages or Arab period. The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at [[Megara Hyblaea]] in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at [[Akrai]] (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino.\n\nThe remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric [[burial chamber]]s cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab. There are also some larger rock-cut houses of uncertain date, often said to be Byzantine, but possibly of earlier origin. The so-called ''anaktoron'', or princely palace, located near the top of the hill, is also controversial. Thought by some archeologists originally to have been a Late Bronze Age building, inspired by palatial buildings of the Greek (Mycenaean) Bronze Age, it was more certainly occupied in the Byzantine period. The remains of a large ditch, cut into the limestone, are clearly visible at Filiporto on the western side of the promontory, nearest to Ferla. This probably dates to the 4th century BC, and represents a defensive work of Greek military design, possibly in line with a policy of Dionysius of Syracuse, designed to secure allied sites in the hinterland. There are also three small medieval rock-cut chapels known respectively as the ''Grotta del Crocifisso'' (near the North cemetery), the ''Grotta di San Nicolicchio'' (on the southern side), and the ''Grotta di San Micidario'' (at Filiporto), which preserve very faint traces of frescoes, and attest the presence of small monastic communities.\n\nThe site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archeologist, [[Paolo Orsi]], although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. The finds excavated by Orsi are on display in the Archaeological Museum in Syracuse. They include characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and items of dress, such as bronze [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae (brooches)]] and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}} The size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been 1000 people or more.\n\n==Main monuments==\nPantalica has five cemeteries spread over a large area:\n* The '''necropolis of Filiporto''' consists of almost 1000 tombs, located on the southwestern side of the promontory (accessed by road from Ferla). In the same area are the remains of a defensive rock-cut ditch of later date (probably 4th century BC) traversing the promontory at its narrowest point.\n* The '''North West necropolis''' is one of the earliest (12th and 11th century BC), and is traversed by the tarmac road from Ferla.\n* The '''Cavetta necropolis''' has tombs and rock-cut houses of the prehistoric and later periods, and can be seen from the road and designated viewing platforms.\n* The '''North necropolis''' is a spectacular cemetery of about 1000 tombs covering very steep slopes overlooking the Calcinara river, best seen from the track coming from Sortino and from viewing platforms near the path. Remains of large rock-cut dwellings are on the gentler slopes to the east.\n* The '''South necropolis''' extends along the Anapo river for over 1 kilometre and is easily seen from the trackway at the bottom of the valley (a path leads down to it from the anaktoron). The old railway station, restored, has information about local fauna and flora.\n\nThe so-called '''Anaktoron''' (a Mycenaean princely palace) on the top of the hill is a multi-roomed building of large blocks, with various rectangular rooms, excavated in the 19th century by Paolo Orsi. Its origins are obscure (see above) but it was certainly used in the Byzantine period, as attested by roof tiles and pottery. Since no other prehistoric houses have been found on the hilltop, which is rather eroded, the location of the original prehistoric residential quarters remains uncertain. There may have been various clusters of habitation associated with each major burial zone.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* L. Bernabo Brea ''Sicily before the Greeks.'' (London: Thames and Hudson 1957).\n* R.

Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC., there was thought to be over 5,000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4,000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the [[Anapo]] river with its tributary, the [[Calcinara]], about {{cvt|23|km}} northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n\n==Geography==\n'''Pantalica''' is located on a limestone promontory surrounded by a deep gorge formed by the [[Anapo]] and [[Calcinara]] rivers between the towns of [[Ferla]] and [[Sortino]] in south-eastern [[Sicily]]. In addition to its archaeological interest it is an important nature reserve (Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica), with a variety of local flora and fauna and natural caves (notably the Grotta dei Pipistrelli (Bat Cave)). Various pathways facilitate visitor access, including a disused railway track (dismantled in 1956) along the Anapo valley bottom. The promontory can be accessed directly by car from Ferla, or by walking down the old mule track from the parking place on the road from Sortino and crossing over the Calcinara stream.\n\n[[File:Pantalica1770.jpg|thumb|Square rock-cut tombs in Pantalica]]\n[[File:Pantalica1757.jpg|thumb|Tomb entrance in Pantalica]]\n\n==History==\nIn the 13th century BC, some Sicilian coastal settlements were abandoned, possibly due to the arrival of the [[Sicels]] on the island and the onset of more unsettled conditions. New large sites, like Pantalica, appeared in the hilly coastal hinterlands, probably chosen for defensive reasons.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nPantalica evidently flourished for about 600 years, from about 1250 to 650 BC. The current name of the site probably dates from the Early Middle Ages or Arab period. The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at [[Megara Hyblaea]] in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at [[Akrai]] (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino.\n\nThe remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric [[burial chamber]]s cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab.

The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany but realizes, after a series of brutal murders, that the academy is a front for a supernatural conspiracy. It also features [[Stefania Casini]], [[Flavio Bucci]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Alida Valli]], [[Udo Kier]] and [[Joan Bennett]], in her final film role.\n\nThe film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as ''[[The Three Mothers]]'', which also comprises ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007). ''Suspiria'' has become one of Argento's most successful feature films, receiving critical acclaim for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colors and its [[Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)|score]] by Argento and the [[progressive rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]].\n\n''Suspiria'' was nominated for two [[Saturn Awards]]: [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Bennett in 1978, and Best DVD Classic Film Release, in 2002. It has become a [[cult following|cult classic]], and is recognised as an influential film in the [[horror film|horror genre]]. It served as the inspiration for a 2018 [[Suspiria (2018 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives during a torrential downpour to study at the [[co-ed]] Freiburg Dance Academy, a prestigious German dance school. She encounters another student, Patricia, fleeing in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town until the next morning. Patricia takes refuge at a friend's apartment and reveals something sinister is happening at the school. She is ambushed by a shadowy figure with demonic hands who slashes her repeatedly with a knife, drags her to the roof of the apartment building, hangs her with a noose and throws her through the building's [[skylight]]. Patricia's friend is impaled and killed by falling debris after trying to alert other tenants to the murder.\n\nThe next morning, Suzy returns to the school, where she meets Miss Tanner, a head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the school's deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to her roommate, Olga, and fellow student Sara. Later, Suzy has an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before losing consciousness during a dance class. When Suzy regains consciousness, she finds Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to stay at the school. However, Sara is in the next-door room and the girls become friends.\n\nWhile the students are preparing for supper one night, [[maggot]]s suddenly rain down from the ceiling, forcing the students to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter; Sara is frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing.\n\nThe school's blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his [[German Shepherd]] bites Albert. That night, Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza; his dog turns on him and rips his throat out.\n\nAt the school, Sara tells Suzy that <em>she</em> was the one on the intercom refusing her entry the night Patricia was murdered. She says that Patricia was behaving strangely before her death and that some notes she left are missing. Suddenly, Suzy loses consciousness and Sara is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. The assailant pursues Sara through the school and corners her in the attic. She escapes through a small window but lands in a pit of [[Barbed tape|razor wire]] which entangles her, allowing her pursuer to kill her by slashing her throat.\n\nWhen Suzy questions her about Sara's disappearance the next morning, Tanner tells her that Sara has run away. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sara's friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel.\nHe reveals that the school was established by a Greek [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]], Helena Markos, who was allegedly a [[witch]]. Suzy also consults Professor Milius, a professor of the [[occult]]. He reveals that a coven of witches will perish without their leader, from whom they draw their power.\n\nWhen Suzy returns to the school, she finds everyone has left to attend the [[Bolshoi Ballet]]. She follows the sound of footsteps to Blanc's office. Remembering that Patricia uttered the words ''secret'' and ''iris'' the night she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door which she opens by turning the blue iris on a mural in Blanc's office.\n\nSuzy enters the corridor and finds the instructors, led by Blanc, plotting her demise. Albert alerts a servant, Pavlo, to Suzy's presence. As Suzy flees, she discovers Sara's disfigured corpse and hides in another room. She notices the woman with the hoarse breathing is asleep in the room with her and quickly deduces she is Helena Markos. As she tries to flee, Markos awakens and taunts Suzy before [[Necromancy|reanimating Sara's mutilated corpse]] to murder her. Flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos's silhouette, and Suzy impales her through the neck with a decorative glass peacock quill. Markos's death causes Sara's possessed corpse to vanish.\n\nAs Suzy flees, the school crumbles  and she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlo and the rest of the coven perish without Markos.

The [[production design]] and [[cinematography]] emphasize vivid [[primary color]]s, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of [[imbibition]] [[Technicolor]] prints. Commenting on the film's lush colors, Argento said: <blockquote>\"We were trying to reproduce the colour of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|Snow White]]''; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances\u2014like cut-out cartoons.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}</blockquote>\n\nThe imbibition process, used for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke.<ref name=25th/> It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/dario-argentos-suspiria-visual-aural-masterwork/ |title=Dario Argento's Suspiria: A Visual and Aural Masterwork | publisher = Indiana Public Media |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2017-12-18|author=jrhodes}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\n====Dubbing====\nIn the ''Suspiria: 25th Anniversary'' documentary, Harper commented on the fact that the actors' dialogue was not properly recorded, but was dubbed through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]]\u2014common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time.<ref name=25th/> Part of the reason was, she said, that each actor spoke their native language (for instance, Harper, Valli, and Bennett spoke [[English language|English]]; Casini, Bos\u00e9, Valli, and Bucci spoke Italian; and several others spoke [[German language|German]]), and as each actor generally knew what the other was saying anyway, they each responded with their lines as if they had understood the other. Argento also expressed disappointment over the fact that Harper's voice, which he liked, was not heard in the Italian market because she was dubbed in Italian by another actress. The dubbing was overseen by [[Ted Rusoff]], a prolific [[Voice Over Artist|voiceover artist]] based in Rome who supervised English-language dubbing for numerous European genre films including Argento's follow-up to ''Suspiria'', [[Inferno (1980 film)|''Inferno'']].\n\n====Musical score====\n{{Main|Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)}}\nThe Italian [[Progressive rock|prog-rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] composed most of the film's [[Film score|score]] in collaboration with Argento himself.<ref name=25th/> Goblin had scored Argento's earlier film ''[[Deep Red]]'' as well as several subsequent films following ''Suspiria''.

Several albums have also used the title, including [[Suspiria (Darkwell album)|an album by gothic metal band Darkwell]], [[Suspiria (Miranda Sex Garden album)|an album by Darkwave band Miranda Sex Garden]] and ''Suspiria de Profundis'' by [[Die Form]], which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey's work of the same title. The film's music has also been imitated and sampled by various artists, including [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] in the track \"Psalm 69\" from their album ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]'', [[Cage Kennylz]] on \"Weather People\" and [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] on \"Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know\". The American death metal band Infester included a sample from the film in their song, \"Chamber of Reunion\", from their album ''To the Depths, In Degradation'' (1994). The [[Houston]], [[Texas]]-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra included a track titled \"Goblin Attack\" on their 2004 CD ''Danse Macabre: Constant Companion'' that features a strings rendition of the ''Suspiria'' theme; the track's title also appears to be a reference to the band Goblin. [[The 69 Eyes]] have a song called \"Suspiria Snow White\" on their album ''[[Back in Blood (The 69 Eyes album)|Back in Blood]]'' (2009).\n\nA section of the soundtrack cue \"Markos\" was incorporated into the  Australian radiophonic work ''What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me'', conceived and written by radio presenter and author [[Russell Guy]], co-narrated by Guy and former ABC-TV newsreader [[James Dibble]], and co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt. It was originally broadcast in 1978 on the ABC's \"youth\" radio station 2JJ aka Double Jay (the Sydney-based AM-band precursor to the current [[Triple J]] network).\n\nIn books by [[Simon R. Green]], mentions are often made of a \"Black Forest Dance Academy\" in Germany, a place where witches and [[Satanism|Satanists]] gather, a possible reference to ''Suspiria''.\n\n''Suspiria'' is featured in the documentary film ''[[Terror in the Aisles]]'' (1984). In the comedy-drama film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007), ''Suspiria'' is considered by the title character to be the goriest film ever made, until she is shown ''[[The Wizard of Gore]]'' and changes her mind, saying it is actually gorier than ''Suspiria''. The film is also mentioned in the episode \"The Seminar\" of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' (season 7), Kirby Reed's horror film collection in the horror film ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), and in [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]\u2019s ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' where a character watches ''Suspiria'' on television.\n\n==Related works==\n===Subsequent films===\n''Suspiria'' is the first of a trilogy of films by Argento, referred to as \"[[The Three Mothers]]\".{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=73}} The trilogy centers around three witches, or \"Mothers of Sorrow\" who unleash evil from three locations in the world.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=87\u201392}} In ''Suspiria'', Helena Marcos is ''Mater Suspiriorum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Sighs\") in [[Freiburg]].{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=88\u20139}} Argento's 1980 film ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' focuses on ''Mater Tenebrarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Darkness\"), in [[New York City]].{{Sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}} The final installment in the trilogy, ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007), focuses on ''Mater Lachrymarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Tears\") in Rome.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}\n\nFilm scholar L. Andrew Cooper notes \"Aesthetic experience is arguably the ultimate source of 'meaning' in all of Argento's films, but ''Suspiria'' and the other films of the Three Mothers trilogy...take their emphasis on aesthetics further by self-consciously connecting their irrational worlds to nineteenth-century romanticism and the aestheticism that grew out of it.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}}\n\n===Unfilmed remake===\nIt was announced through [[MTV]] in 2008 that a remake of ''Suspiria'' was in production, to be directed by [[David Gordon Green]], who directed films such as ''[[Undertow (2004 film)|Undertow]]'' and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/03/05/david-gordon-green-confirms-suspiria-remake/ |title=David Gordon Green Confirms 'Suspiria' Remake |first=Shawn |last=Adler |date=5 March 2008 |website=MTV |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The announcement was met with hostility by some,<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |title=Please Leave Suspiria Alone |last=Brigden |first=Charlie |work=lostinthemultiplex.com |access-date=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120181426/http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |archive-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> including Argento himself.<ref name=\"riff.is/tv\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9Zd3kMK7g |title=Interview with Dario Argento after his masterclass |last=\u00deorvalds|first=Esther|work=riff.is/tv |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> The film was to be produced by Italian production company First Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/17315/ |title='Suspiria' Remake to Shoot in 2010 | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=8 September 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> In August 2008, it was reported that [[Natalie Portman]] and Annette Savitch's Handsome Charlie Films were set to produce the remake, and that Portman would play the lead role.<ref name=\"BDNews\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/13203/ |title=Update #2: Natalie Portman to Topline 'Suspiria' Remake! | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=6 August 2008 |work=Bloody Disgusting |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The project was also announced to be produced by Marco Morabito and [[Luca Guadagnino]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.badtaste.it/articoli/suspiria-2010-producer-yes-shooting-starting-and-no-there-wont-be-marilyn-manson |title=Suspiria 2010, the producer: \"Yes the shooting is starting and no, there won't be Marilyn Manson\" |publisher = BadTaste.it - Il nuovo gusto del cinema! |last=Berni |first=Andrea Francesco |date=10 July 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> After a period of no news in which it was thought that the remake attempt had failed, Green said in August 2011 that he was still trying to remake the film.<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\"/> It was announced on 15 May 2012 that actress [[Isabelle Fuhrman]] would be cast as the lead.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/55628/hunger-games-and-orphan-star-isabelle-fuhrman-set-suspiria |title=The Hunger Games and Orphan Star Isabelle Fuhrman Set for Suspiria |date=15 May 2012 |work=Dread Central |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Later that year, however, the planned remake was put on hold.

The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany but realizes, after a series of brutal murders, that the academy is a front for a supernatural conspiracy. It also features [[Stefania Casini]], [[Flavio Bucci]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Alida Valli]], [[Udo Kier]] and [[Joan Bennett]], in her final film role.\n\nThe film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as ''[[The Three Mothers]]'', which also comprises ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007). ''Suspiria'' has become one of Argento's most successful feature films, receiving critical acclaim for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colors and its [[Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)|score]] by Argento and the [[progressive rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]].\n\n''Suspiria'' was nominated for two [[Saturn Awards]]: [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Bennett in 1978, and Best DVD Classic Film Release, in 2002. It has become a [[cult classic]], and is recognised as an influential film in the [[horror film|horror genre]]. It served as the inspiration for a 2018 [[Suspiria (2018 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives during a torrential downpour to study at the [[co-ed]] Freiburg Dance Academy, a prestigious German dance school. She encounters another student, Patricia, fleeing in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town until the next morning. Patricia takes refuge at a friend's apartment and reveals something sinister is happening at the school. She is ambushed by a shadowy figure with demonic hands who slashes her repeatedly with a knife, drags her to the roof of the apartment building, hangs her with a noose and throws her through the building's [[skylight]]. Patricia's friend is impaled and killed by falling debris after trying to alert other tenants to the murder.\n\nThe next morning, Suzy returns to the school, where she meets Miss Tanner, a head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the school's deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to her roommate, Olga, and fellow student Sara. Later, Suzy has an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before losing consciousness during a dance class. When Suzy regains consciousness, she finds Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to stay at the school. However, Sara is in the next-door room and the girls become friends.\n\nWhile the students are preparing for supper one night, [[maggot]]s suddenly rain down from the ceiling, forcing the students to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter; Sara is frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing.\n\nThe school's blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his [[German Shepherd]] bites Albert. That night, Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza; his dog turns on him and rips his throat out.\n\nAt the school, Sara tells Suzy that <em>she</em> was the one on the intercom refusing her entry the night Patricia was murdered. She says that Patricia was behaving strangely before her death and that some notes she left are missing. Suddenly, Suzy loses consciousness and Sara is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. The assailant pursues Sara through the school and corners her in the attic. She escapes through a small window but lands in a pit of [[Barbed tape|razor wire]] which entangles her, allowing her pursuer to kill her by slashing her throat.\n\nWhen Suzy questions her about Sara's disappearance the next morning, Tanner tells her that Sara has run away. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sara's friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel.\nHe reveals that the school was established by a Greek [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]], Helena Markos, who was allegedly a [[witch]]. Suzy also consults Professor Milius, a professor of the [[occult]]. He reveals that a coven of witches will perish without their leader, from whom they draw their power.\n\nWhen Suzy returns to the school, she finds everyone has left to attend the [[Bolshoi Ballet]]. She follows the sound of footsteps to Blanc's office. Remembering that Patricia uttered the words ''secret'' and ''iris'' the night she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door which she opens by turning the blue iris on a mural in Blanc's office.\n\nSuzy enters the corridor and finds the instructors, led by Blanc, plotting her demise. Albert alerts a servant, Pavlo, to Suzy's presence. As Suzy flees, she discovers Sara's disfigured corpse and hides in another room. She notices the woman with the hoarse breathing is asleep in the room with her and quickly deduces she is Helena Markos. As she tries to flee, Markos awakens and taunts Suzy before [[Necromancy|reanimating Sara's mutilated corpse]] to murder her. Flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos's silhouette, and Suzy impales her through the neck with a decorative glass peacock quill. Markos's death causes Sara's possessed corpse to vanish.\n\nAs Suzy flees, the school crumbles  and she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlo and the rest of the coven perish without Markos. Suzy escapes into the night while the school is consumed by fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Susanna \"Suzy\" Bannion\n* [[Stefania Casini]] as Sara Simms\n* [[Flavio Bucci]] as Daniel\n* [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] as Mark ([[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in the English release by [[Gregory Snegoff]])\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Miss Tanner\n* [[Joan Bennett]] as Madame Blanc\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Dr. Frank Mandel (dubbed by Frank von Kugelgen)\n* [[Barbara Magnolfi]] as Olga Ivanova (dubbed by [[Carolyn De Fonseca]])\n* [[Eva Ax\u00e9n]] as Patricia \"Pat\" Hingle\n* [[Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler]] as Professor Milius (dubbed by [[Geoffrey Copleston]])\n* [[Susanna Javicoli]] as Sonia\n* [[Franca Scagnetti]] as Cook\n* Giuseppe Transocchi as Pavlo\n* Jacopo Mariani as Albert\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Professor Verdegast\n* Margherita Horowitz as Teacher\n* [[Ted Rusoff]] as Police Inspector (dubbing in the English release)\n* Lela Svasta as Mater Suspiriorum/Helena Markos (uncredited)\n* [[Dario Argento]] as Narrator (uncredited) (dubbed by William Kiehl) (uncredited)}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nArgento based ''Suspiria'' in part on [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s essay ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845).{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=146}}{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}} Critic Maitland McDonagh notes: \"In Argento's reading [of the material], the three mothers generate/inhabit a cinematic world informed by [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypal imagery, each holding sway over a particular city.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=29}} Argento said the idea for the film came to him after a trip through several European cities, including [[Lyon]], [[Prague]], and [[Turin]].<ref name=25th>{{cite av media|title=Suspiria 25th Anniversary|year=2001|people=Hertz, Gary (director)|display-authors=etal|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330950/}}</ref> He became fascinated by the \"Magic Triangle,\" a point where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet; this is where [[Rudolf Steiner]], a controversial social reformer and [[occult]]ist, founded an [[anthroposophic]] community.<ref name=25th/> Commenting on witchcraft and the occult, Argento stated: \"There's very little to joke about.

The [[production design]] and [[cinematography]] emphasize vivid [[primary color]]s, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of [[imbibition]] [[Technicolor]] prints. Commenting on the film's lush colors, Argento said: <blockquote>\"We were trying to reproduce the colour of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|Snow White]]''; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances\u2014like cut-out cartoons.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}</blockquote>\n\nThe imbibition process, used for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke.<ref name=25th/> It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/dario-argentos-suspiria-visual-aural-masterwork/ |title=Dario Argento's Suspiria: A Visual and Aural Masterwork | publisher = Indiana Public Media |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2017-12-18|author=jrhodes}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\n====Dubbing====\nIn the ''Suspiria: 25th Anniversary'' documentary, Harper commented on the fact that the actors' dialogue was not properly recorded, but was dubbed through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]]\u2014common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time.<ref name=25th/> Part of the reason was, she said, that each actor spoke their native language (for instance, Harper, Valli, and Bennett spoke [[English language|English]]; Casini, Bos\u00e9, Valli, and Bucci spoke Italian; and several others spoke [[German language|German]]), and as each actor generally knew what the other was saying anyway, they each responded with their lines as if they had understood the other. Argento also expressed disappointment over the fact that Harper's voice, which he liked, was not heard in the Italian market because she was dubbed in Italian by another actress. The dubbing was overseen by [[Ted Rusoff]], a prolific [[Voice Over Artist|voiceover artist]] based in Rome who supervised English-language dubbing for numerous European genre films including Argento's follow-up to ''Suspiria'', [[Inferno (1980 film)|''Inferno'']].\n\n====Musical score====\n{{Main|Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)}}\nThe Italian [[Progressive rock|prog-rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] composed most of the film's [[Film score|score]] in collaboration with Argento himself.<ref name=25th/> Goblin had scored Argento's earlier film ''[[Deep Red]]'' as well as several subsequent films following ''Suspiria''.

Several albums have also used the title, including [[Suspiria (Darkwell album)|an album by gothic metal band Darkwell]], [[Suspiria (Miranda Sex Garden album)|an album by Darkwave band Miranda Sex Garden]] and ''Suspiria de Profundis'' by [[Die Form]], which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey's work of the same title. The film's music has also been imitated and sampled by various artists, including [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] in the track \"Psalm 69\" from their album ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]'', [[Cage Kennylz]] on \"Weather People\" and [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] on \"Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know\". The American death metal band Infester included a sample from the film in their song, \"Chamber of Reunion\", from their album ''To the Depths, In Degradation'' (1994). The [[Houston]], [[Texas]]-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra included a track titled \"Goblin Attack\" on their 2004 CD ''Danse Macabre: Constant Companion'' that features a strings rendition of the ''Suspiria'' theme; the track's title also appears to be a reference to the band Goblin. [[The 69 Eyes]] have a song called \"Suspiria Snow White\" on their album ''[[Back in Blood (The 69 Eyes album)|Back in Blood]]'' (2009).\n\nA section of the soundtrack cue \"Markos\" was incorporated into the  Australian radiophonic work ''What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me'', conceived and written by radio presenter and author [[Russell Guy]], co-narrated by Guy and former ABC-TV newsreader [[James Dibble]], and co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt. It was originally broadcast in 1978 on the ABC's \"youth\" radio station 2JJ aka Double Jay (the Sydney-based AM-band precursor to the current [[Triple J]] network).\n\nIn books by [[Simon R. Green]], mentions are often made of a \"Black Forest Dance Academy\" in Germany, a place where witches and [[Satanism|Satanists]] gather, a possible reference to ''Suspiria''.\n\n''Suspiria'' is featured in the documentary film ''[[Terror in the Aisles]]'' (1984). In the comedy-drama film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007), ''Suspiria'' is considered by the title character to be the goriest film ever made, until she is shown ''[[The Wizard of Gore]]'' and changes her mind, saying it is actually gorier than ''Suspiria''. The film is also mentioned in the episode \"The Seminar\" of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' (season 7), Kirby Reed's horror film collection in the horror film ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), and in [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]\u2019s ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' where a character watches ''Suspiria'' on television.\n\n==Related works==\n===Subsequent films===\n''Suspiria'' is the first of a trilogy of films by Argento, referred to as \"[[The Three Mothers]]\".{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=73}} The trilogy centers around three witches, or \"Mothers of Sorrow\" who unleash evil from three locations in the world.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=87\u201392}} In ''Suspiria'', Helena Marcos is ''Mater Suspiriorum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Sighs\") in [[Freiburg]].{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=88\u20139}} Argento's 1980 film ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' focuses on ''Mater Tenebrarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Darkness\"), in [[New York City]].{{Sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}} The final installment in the trilogy, ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007), focuses on ''Mater Lachrymarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Tears\") in Rome.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}\n\nFilm scholar L. Andrew Cooper notes \"Aesthetic experience is arguably the ultimate source of 'meaning' in all of Argento's films, but ''Suspiria'' and the other films of the Three Mothers trilogy...take their emphasis on aesthetics further by self-consciously connecting their irrational worlds to nineteenth-century romanticism and the aestheticism that grew out of it.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}}\n\n===Unfilmed remake===\nIt was announced through [[MTV]] in 2008 that a remake of ''Suspiria'' was in production, to be directed by [[David Gordon Green]], who directed films such as ''[[Undertow (2004 film)|Undertow]]'' and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/03/05/david-gordon-green-confirms-suspiria-remake/ |title=David Gordon Green Confirms 'Suspiria' Remake |first=Shawn |last=Adler |date=5 March 2008 |website=MTV |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The announcement was met with hostility by some,<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |title=Please Leave Suspiria Alone |last=Brigden |first=Charlie |work=lostinthemultiplex.com |access-date=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120181426/http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |archive-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> including Argento himself.<ref name=\"riff.is/tv\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9Zd3kMK7g |title=Interview with Dario Argento after his masterclass |last=\u00deorvalds|first=Esther|work=riff.is/tv |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> The film was to be produced by Italian production company First Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/17315/ |title='Suspiria' Remake to Shoot in 2010 | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=8 September 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> In August 2008, it was reported that [[Natalie Portman]] and Annette Savitch's Handsome Charlie Films were set to produce the remake, and that Portman would play the lead role.<ref name=\"BDNews\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/13203/ |title=Update #2: Natalie Portman to Topline 'Suspiria' Remake! | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=6 August 2008 |work=Bloody Disgusting |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The project was also announced to be produced by Marco Morabito and [[Luca Guadagnino]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.badtaste.it/articoli/suspiria-2010-producer-yes-shooting-starting-and-no-there-wont-be-marilyn-manson |title=Suspiria 2010, the producer: \"Yes the shooting is starting and no, there won't be Marilyn Manson\" |publisher = BadTaste.it - Il nuovo gusto del cinema! |last=Berni |first=Andrea Francesco |date=10 July 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> After a period of no news in which it was thought that the remake attempt had failed, Green said in August 2011 that he was still trying to remake the film.<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\"/> It was announced on 15 May 2012 that actress [[Isabelle Fuhrman]] would be cast as the lead.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/55628/hunger-games-and-orphan-star-isabelle-fuhrman-set-suspiria |title=The Hunger Games and Orphan Star Isabelle Fuhrman Set for Suspiria |date=15 May 2012 |work=Dread Central |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Later that year, however, the planned remake was put on hold.
