As one of the last commercially built steam locomotives in the United States, the locomotive was built with the primary purpose of hauling long, heavy, high speed express [[passenger trains]] for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway such as the ''George Washington'' and the ''Fast Flying Virginian''. Retired from active service in the late 1950s, the 614 was preserved and placed on display at the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum| B&O Railroad Museum]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Between 1979 and 1980, restoration work on the locomotive to operating condition took place, and it was used for extensive mainline [[Excursion trains|excursion service]] from the early 1980s until the late 1990s. Today the locomotive is on temporary display at the C&O Railway Heritage Center in [[Clifton Forge, Virginia]] awaiting a potential return to steam.\n\n==Background==\nMost railroads called their 4-8-4s \"[[4-8-4|Northerns]]\", which is short for the railroad first using the 4-8-4 type, [[Northern Pacific Railroad]]. The workers of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway|C&O]] could not see naming these locomotives \"Northerns\" as the railroad was based in the southeast. The famous [[Greenbrier Hotel]] in [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia]], a major resort on the C&O mainline, was the inspiration for the name \"[[4-8-4|Greenbrier]]\" applied to these 4-8-4s.[[File:C&O 614 (5874089001).jpg|left|thumb|C&O 614 on display in Clifton Forge, VA.]]\n\nThe C&O had a total of 12 4-8-4s, with the first five numbered 600-604 built in 1935, with the designation J-3. In 1942, two more were ordered from Lima numbered 605-606. In 1948, the design changed slightly and the 610-614 were produced, with the J-3-A designation. In 1952, 614 was retired from service and sent to a storage track in a Kentucky roundhouse where she sat for more than two decades. During the time she sat, 614 was renumbered to 611 when there was a power shortage on the C&O as to alleviate any confusion with a leased 4-8-4 that was also numbered 614.\n\n==Excursion service==\nIn 1976, 614 was sent to the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and was cosmetically restored.\n\nDuring 1979, the 614 was sold to Ross E. Rowland Jr. She was restored over the next 18 months with a cost of $1.5 million. During the restoration, 614 was given an auxiliary tender, doubling her water capacity to 50,000 gallons. This allowed the 614 to run for longer times without having to refuel as much. The Chessie Safety Express was 614's first major run, bringing her a bit of spotlight in the process. After the successful system tour, 614 was kept in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]] until 1985. American Coal Enterprise was developing a modern steam locomotive to be used as an alternative to rising oil costs by burning coal, known as the ACE 3000 Project. The 614 was modified for better performance under the guidance of David Wardale, and fitted with testing equipment to measure the performance of the engine. For several weeks in January and February 1985, 614 (now 614-T, symbolizing it as testing) hauled coal trains between [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] and [[Hinton, West Virginia]]. The 614's fuel consumption costs were actually lower than most diesel locomotives operating at that time. Throughout 1996 to 1998, 614 pulled many successful excursions between [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and [[Port Jervis, New York]] [[File:C&O Railway Heritage Center - C&O 614 Locomotive - 9.JPG|thumb|left|C&O 614 engine cab.]]\n\nIn 1992, Rowland's vision of the ''21st Century Limited'' was taking shape. To give the public an idea of the train, one side of 614 was decorated in a futuristic way with a blue streamlined shrouding and centered headlight. In 1995, 614 was moved to the [[New Hope Railroad|New Hope and Ivyland Railroad]] in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]] for a complete overhaul. It was then used for a series of popular [[Excursion trains|excursions]] between [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and [[Port Jervis, New York]] in conjunction with [[New Jersey Transit]] (NJT) between 1996 and 1998.\n\n==Current status==\n614 was required to pull 26 [[Passenger car (rail)|cars]] at 79&nbsp;mph on some sections, and maintain speed up several hills. During this time, 614 was equipped with cab signals, 26L brakes, speed control and an MU stand. The 614 was moved to storage on the [[Reading and Northern Railroad]] in [[Port Clinton, Pennsylvania]]. In 2000. Rowland put 614 up for auction at the NJT maintenance facility, but no buyers were interested. The locomotive is still maintained by Iron Horse Enterprises, the most recent servicing of the locomotive being in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, discussions began between Rowland and Jim Justice, owner of the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia. The resort owner had been interested in running steam-powered excursion trains from Greenbrier to Washington DC. To be known as the \"Greenbrier Express\", Justice planned to use steam and diesel power in the project, but would have needed cooperation from [[CSX Transportation]], the [[Buckingham Branch Railroad]] and [[Amtrak]]. In January 2011, 614 was moved to the [[Virginia Museum of Transportation]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] for its ''Thoroughbreds of Steam'' exhibit. In May 2011, 614 was again moved to the C&O Railway Heritage Center in Clifton Forge, Virginia. From there it went to Clifton Forge, Virginia where it was repainted in preparation for display for the [[Greenbrier Presidential Express]]. Unfortunately, the Greenbrier Express project was cancelled in May 2012 due to lack of funding and capacity problems on the CSX portion of the route, where a lack of passing sidings makes it difficult for Eastbound trains to gain headway against the flow of Westbound empty coal trains. The diesels and passenger cars were auctioned off, and 614 continues to sit on display at Clifton Forge. As of 2019, 614 is still painted in the failed Greenbrier Presidential Express scheme. Iron Horse Enterprises plans to invest the necessary funds to overhaul 614 for operation once an opportunity to run the engine is finalized.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Chesapeake and Ohio 614}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110831022253/http://www.steamlocomotive.com/northern/?page=co The Chesapeake and Ohio Greenbriers, Including The 614]\n*[http://www.co614.com Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Steam Locomotive #614]\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/tusp/ult.html ACE 3000 and the testing with the 614]\n*[http://themetrains.com/chessie-safety-express-main.htm The 1980-1981 Chessie Safety Express with C&O 614]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chesapeake and Ohio 0614}}\n[[Category:Individual locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:4-8-4 locomotives]]\n[[Category:Chesapeake and Ohio locomotives|0614]]\n[[Category:Lima locomotives]]\n[[Category:Passenger locomotives]]\n[[Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1948]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp|small=yes}} \n{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n{{Infobox locomotive\n| name=Chesapeake & Ohio 614\n| powertype=Steam\n| image = C&O Railway Heritage Center - C&O 614 Locomotive - 3.JPG\n| caption = Chesapeake and Ohio 614 on display in 2012.

The famous [[Greenbrier Hotel]] in [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia]], a major resort on the C&O mainline, was the inspiration for the name \"[[4-8-4|Greenbrier]]\" applied to these 4-8-4s.[[File:C&O 614 (5874089001).jpg|left|thumb|C&O 614 on display in Clifton Forge, VA.]]\n\nThe C&O had a total of 12 4-8-4s, with the first five numbered 600-604 built in 1935, with the designation J-3. In 1942, two more were ordered from Lima numbered 605-606. In 1948, the design changed slightly and the 610-614 were produced, with the J-3-A designation. In 1952, 614 was retired from service and sent to a storage track in a Kentucky roundhouse where she sat for more than two decades. During the time she sat, 614 was renumbered to 611 when there was a power shortage on the C&O as to alleviate any confusion with a leased 4-8-4 that was also numbered 614.\n\n==Excursion service==\nIn 1976, 614 was sent to the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and was cosmetically restored.\n\nDuring 1979, the 614 was sold to Ross E. Rowland Jr. She was restored over the next 18 months with a cost of $1.5 million. During the restoration, 614 was given an auxiliary tender, doubling her water capacity to 50,000 gallons. This allowed the 614 to run for longer times without having to refuel as much. The Chessie Safety Express was 614's first major run, bringing her a bit of spotlight in the process. After the successful system tour, 614 was kept in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]] until 1985. American Coal Enterprise was developing a modern steam locomotive to be used as an alternative to rising oil costs by burning coal, known as the ACE 3000 Project. The 614 was modified for better performance under the guidance of David Wardale, and fitted with testing equipment to measure the performance of the engine. For several weeks in January and February 1985, 614 (now 614-T, symbolizing it as testing) hauled coal trains between [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] and [[Hinton, West Virginia]]. The 614's fuel consumption costs were actually lower than most diesel locomotives operating at that time. Throughout 1996 to 1998, 614 pulled many successful excursions between [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and [[Port Jervis, New York]] [[File:C&O Railway Heritage Center - C&O 614 Locomotive - 9.JPG|thumb|left|C&O 614 engine cab.]]\n\nIn 1992, Rowland's vision of the ''21st Century Limited'' was taking shape. To give the public an idea of the train, one side of 614 was decorated in a futuristic way with a blue streamlined shrouding and centered headlight. In 1995, 614 was moved to the [[New Hope Railroad|New Hope and Ivyland Railroad]] in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]] for a complete overhaul. It was then used for a series of popular [[Excursion trains|excursions]] between [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and [[Port Jervis, New York]] in conjunction with [[New Jersey Transit]] (NJT) between 1996 and 1998.\n\n==Current status==\n614 was required to pull 26 [[Passenger car (rail)|cars]] at 79&nbsp;mph on some sections, and maintain speed up several hills. During this time, 614 was equipped with cab signals, 26L brakes, speed control and an MU stand. The 614 was moved to storage on the [[Reading and Northern Railroad]] in [[Port Clinton, Pennsylvania]]. In 2000. Rowland put 614 up for auction at the NJT maintenance facility, but no buyers were interested. The locomotive is still maintained by Iron Horse Enterprises, the most recent servicing of the locomotive being in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, discussions began between Rowland and Jim Justice, owner of the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia. The resort owner had been interested in running steam-powered excursion trains from Greenbrier to Washington DC. To be known as the \"Greenbrier Express\", Justice planned to use steam and diesel power in the project, but would have needed cooperation from [[CSX Transportation]], the [[Buckingham Branch Railroad]] and [[Amtrak]]. In January 2011, 614 was moved to the [[Virginia Museum of Transportation]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] for its ''Thoroughbreds of Steam'' exhibit. In May 2011, 614 was again moved to the C&O Railway Heritage Center in Clifton Forge, Virginia. From there it went to Clifton Forge, Virginia where it was repainted in preparation for display for the [[Greenbrier Presidential Express]]. Unfortunately, the Greenbrier Express project was cancelled in May 2012 due to lack of funding and capacity problems on the CSX portion of the route, where a lack of passing sidings makes it difficult for Eastbound trains to gain headway against the flow of Westbound empty coal trains. The diesels and passenger cars were auctioned off, and 614 continues to sit on display at Clifton Forge. As of 2019, 614 is still painted in the failed Greenbrier Presidential Express scheme. Iron Horse Enterprises plans to invest the necessary funds to overhaul 614 for operation once an opportunity to run the engine is finalized.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Chesapeake and Ohio 614}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110831022253/http://www.steamlocomotive.com/northern/?page=co The Chesapeake and Ohio Greenbriers, Including The 614]\n*[http://www.co614.com Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Steam Locomotive #614]\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/tusp/ult.html ACE 3000 and the testing with the 614]\n*[http://themetrains.com/chessie-safety-express-main.htm The 1980-1981 Chessie Safety Express with C&O 614]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chesapeake and Ohio 0614}}\n[[Category:Individual locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:4-8-4 locomotives]]\n[[Category:Chesapeake and Ohio locomotives|0614]]\n[[Category:Lima locomotives]]\n[[Category:Passenger locomotives]]\n[[Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1948]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Chicago Burlington and Quincy 4960", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed info", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_614"}

The season consisted of 9 half-hour episodes, and 5 hour-long episodes to comprise the 19 total episodes of material created. ''The Office'' is an American adaptation of the [[The Office (British TV series)|British TV series of the same name]], and is presented in a [[mockumentary]] format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictitious [[Dunder Mifflin|Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]]. The season was originally set to include 30 episodes, but due to the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]], it was shortened to 19 episodes. It stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J. Novak]], with supporting performances from [[Melora Hardin]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Leslie David Baker]], [[Brian Baumgartner]], [[Creed Bratton]], [[Kate Flannery]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Angela Kinsey]], [[Paul Lieberstein]], [[Oscar Nunez]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], and [[Phyllis Smith]].\n\nSeason four marked the departure of [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) as a regular character, although she appeared for a few seconds in the first episode, \"[[Fun Run]]\" and in the sixth episode, \"[[Branch Wars]]\", as the regional manager of the Utica branch. Relationships again emerged as the main theme of the season, with [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Beesly]]'s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) rising, and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Jan Levinson]]'s ([[Melora Hardin]]), as well as [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Angela Martin]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) declining. Technology was another prevalent theme as the office staff struggled with initiatives introduced by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) to modernize the company.\n\nThe fourth season of ''The Office'' aired on Thursdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern]]) in the United States. The season marked a slight drop in ratings compared to the previous two seasons. Critical reception to the season continued to be largely positive. The season was released on DVD by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] in a four-disc box set in the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] area on September 2, 2008. The DVD set contains all 19 episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on some of the episodes. It also contains deleted scenes from all of the episodes, as well as bloopers and other promos.\n\n==Production==\nThe fourth season of the show was produced by [[Reveille Productions]] and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with [[Universal Media Studios]]. The show is based upon the British series created by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], both of whom are [[executive producer]]s on both the US and UK versions.<ref name=\"GreenLight\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/18/broadcasting.internationalnews|title=American ''Office'' Gets Green Light|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 22, 2008 | first=David | last=Wood | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> ''The Office'' is produced by [[Greg Daniels]],<ref name=\"GreenLight\"/> who is also an executive producer and the [[show runner]].

Pam accepts a three month training program in New York, and just as Jim is about to propose to her, Andy publicly proposes to Angela who reluctantly agrees. Angela is later caught having sex with Dwight in the office. Ryan's downfall is complete as he is dragged from the New York office after committing fraud related to the website.\n |LineColor=4e4a4a\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n{{note|b|\u2021}} denotes an hour-long episode (with advertisements; actual runtime around 42 minutes).\n\n== Home media ==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#4e4a4a; color:#ffffff;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" | '''''The Office: The Complete Fourth Season'''''\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| align=\"center\" width=\"400\" colspan=\"4\"| '''Set details'''<ref name=\"DVD4\">{{cite DVD notes |title=The Office: The Complete Fourth Season |origyear=[[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308]] |others=[[Greg Daniels]], et al |type=back cover |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref><ref name=dvd2/>\n| width=\"400\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\"|'''Special features'''<ref name=\"DVD4\"/><ref name=dvd2>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Office-Season-4-Press-Release/9775 |title=Universal Issues a Press Release for ''The Office'' \u2013 Season 4 DVDs |publisher=Universal Studios |accessdate=August 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812095626/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Office-Season-4-Press-Release/9775 |archivedate=August 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"left\" width=\"400\"|\n* 19 episodes\n* 4-disc set\n* 1.78:1 aspect ratio\n* Subtitles: English, Spanish\n* English (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround)\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"left\" width=\"400\"|\n*Commentary on 4 episodes by the actors, writers, and producers\n*Deleted scenes from every episode\n*Blooper Reel\n*''The Office'' Convention \"Writers' Block Panel Discussion\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" | '''Release dates'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]]\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | Region 2\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | {{Start date|2008|9|2}}\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | {{Start date|2010|6|14}} \n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nbc.com/node/62021/episodes?field_season_target_id=61836 Episode guides at NBC.com]\n* {{Imdb episodes|0386676|The Office}}\n* {{Tv.com episodes|the-office|22343|The Office|4}}\n\n{{The Office US}}\n{{The Office US Episodes}}\n{{ScreenActorsGuildAwards EnsembleTVComedy 2000\u20132009}}\n\n{{featured list}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Office (American season 4), The}}\n[[Category:The Office (American season 4) episodes| ]]\n[[Category:2007 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:2008 American television seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television season\n | season_number = 4\n | bgcolour = #4e4a4a\n | image = The Office Season Four DVD Cover.jpg\n | image_size = 250\n | caption = DVD cover\n | starring = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Steve Carell]]\n* [[Rainn Wilson]]\n* [[John Krasinski]]\n* [[Jenna Fischer]]\n* [[B.J.

The season consisted of 9 half-hour episodes, and 5 hour-long episodes to comprise the 19 total episodes of material created. ''The Office'' is an American adaptation of the [[The Office (British TV series)|British TV series of the same name]], and is presented in a [[mockumentary]] format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictitious [[Dunder Mifflin|Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]]. The season was originally set to include 30 episodes, but due to the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]], it was shortened to 19 episodes. It stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J. Novak]], with supporting performances from [[Melora Hardin]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Leslie David Baker]], [[Brian Baumgartner]], [[Creed Bratton]], [[Kate Flannery]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Angela Kinsey]], [[Paul Lieberstein]], [[Oscar Nunez]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], and [[Phyllis Smith]].\n\nSeason four marked the departure of [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) as a regular character, although she appeared for a few seconds in the first episode, \"[[Fun Run]]\" and in the sixth episode, \"[[Branch Wars]]\", as the regional manager of the Utica branch. Relationships again emerged as the main theme of the season, with [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Beesly]]'s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) rising, and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Jan Levinson]]'s ([[Melora Hardin]]), as well as [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Angela Martin]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) declining. Technology was another prevalent theme as the office staff struggled with initiatives introduced by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) to modernize the company.\n\nThe fourth season of ''The Office'' aired on Thursdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern]]) in the United States. The season marked a slight drop in ratings compared to the previous two seasons. Critical reception to the season continued to be largely positive. The season was released on DVD by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] in a four-disc box set in the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] area on September 2, 2008. The DVD set contains all 19 episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on some of the episodes. It also contains deleted scenes from all of the episodes, as well as bloopers and other promos.\n\n==Production==\nThe fourth season of the show was produced by [[Reveille Productions]] and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with [[Universal Media Studios]]. The show is based upon the British series created by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], both of whom are [[executive producer]]s on both the US and UK versions.<ref name=\"GreenLight\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/18/broadcasting.internationalnews|title=American ''Office'' Gets Green Light|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 22, 2008 | first=David | last=Wood | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> ''The Office'' is produced by [[Greg Daniels]],<ref name=\"GreenLight\"/> who is also an executive producer and the [[show runner]].

The modern army was established during the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (1805\u20131849), widely considered to be the \"founder of modern Egypt\". Its most significant engagements in the 20th century were in Egypt's five wars with the [[Israel|State of Israel]] (in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1967\u20131970, and 1973), one of which, the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, also saw it do combat with the armies of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[France]]. The Egyptian army was also engaged heavily in the protracted [[North Yemen Civil War]], and the brief [[Libyan-Egyptian War]] in July 1977. Its last major engagement was [[Operation Desert Storm]], the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in 1991, in which the Egyptian army constituted the second-largest contingent of the allied forces.\n\nAs of 2019, the army has an estimated strength of 380,000 soldiers, of which, approximately 130,000\u2013200,000 are professionals with the rest being conscripts.\n\n==History==\n{{for|military arrangements in antiquity|Military history of Ancient Egypt}}\n[[File:Hyksos.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Hyksos]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] drove [[chariot]]s.]]\n{{references|section|date=April 2020}}\nFor most parts of its long history, ancient Egypt was unified under one government. There were three kingdoms and two intermediate periods. During the three kingdoms Egypt was unified under one government. During the intermediate periods between kingdoms government control was in the hands of the various nomes (provinces within Egypt) and various foreigners. This circumstance set the stage for many of Egypt's military conquests. They weakened their enemies by using small projectile weapons, like bows and arrows. They also had chariots which they used to charge at the enemy.\n\nThe arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile [[Nile River]] valley. Nevertheless, the great expanses of the desert formed a barrier that protected the river valley and was almost impossible for massive armies to cross. The Egyptians built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in Nubia to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected a message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses.\n\n===Under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty===\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumbnail|Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt displaying his army and navy 1830\u20131848]]\nFollowing his [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|seizure of power]] in Egypt, and declaration of himself as [[khedive]] of the country, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] set about establishing a bona fide Egyptian military. Prior to his rule, Egypt had been governed by the [[Ottoman Empire]], and while he still technically owed fealty to the Ottoman [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], Muhammad Ali sought to gain full independence for Egypt. To further this aim, he brought in European weapons and expertise, and built an army that defeated the [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[1831 Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War|wresting control from the Porte]] of the [[Levant]], and [[Hejaz]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=14}} The Egyptian Army was involved in the following wars during Muhammad Ali's reign:\n* [[Greek War of Independence]]\n* [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)]]\n* [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u20131841)]]\n\nIn addition, Muhammed Ali Pasha utilised his army to [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquer Sudan]] in 1820-24, and unite it with Egypt. In 1882 [[Valentine Baker]] (\"Baker Pasha\") was offered the command of the newly formed Egyptian Army, which he accepted. On his arrival at [[Cairo]], however, the offer was withdrawn and he only obtained command of the Egyptian police.  In this post he devoted by far the greater amount of his energy to the training of the gendarmerie, which he realised would be the reserve of the purely military forces.{{sfn|Carr|1901}} Egypt was then involved in the long-running 1881\u201399 [[Mahdist War]] in the Sudan.\n\n====Making of a professional army====\nDuring [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s reign, the Egyptian army became a much more strictly regimented and professional army. The recruits were separated from daily civilian life and a sense of impersonal law was imposed. Muhammad Ali Pasha previously attempted to create an army of [[Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24#Sudanese slaves in Egypt|Sudanese slaves]] and [[Mamluk]]s, but most died under the intense military training and practices of the Pasha. Instead, the Pasha enforced conscription in 1822 and the new military recruits were mostly Egyptian farmers, also known as [[fellah]]. Because of harsh military practices, the 130,000 soldiers conscripted in 1822 revolted in the south in 1824.\n\nThe Pasha's goal was to create military order through indoctrination by two new major key practices: isolation and surveillance. In previous times, the wives and family were allowed to follow the army wherever they camped. This was no longer the case. The Pasha sought to create a whole new life for the soldier distinct from that of civilian life. In order to be completely indoctrinated and adapted to the military, they needed to be stripped of their daily lives, habits, and practices. Inside these barracks, soldiers were also subjected to new practices. The rules and regulations were not made to inflict punishment on the recruits but rather to impose a sense of respect for the law; the threat of punishment was enough to keep them in line and from [[deserting]]. The [[wikt:roll call|roll-call]] was taken twice a day and those found missing would be declared deserters and would have to face the punishment for their actions.<ref>Famhy, From peasants to soldiers: discipline and training, 128.</ref> Troops were kept busy to prevent the men from being left idle in the camps. The trivial tasks that filled the soldiers live was an attempt to keep the men constantly engaged in useful tasks and not thinking about leaving. There were also many other reasons why the Pasha enforced this strict isolation. Previously, soldiers would ransack towns and cause mayhem wherever they went. Military disobedience was so frequent that the [[Bedouin]]s were employed to keep the soldiers in check. Unfortunately this backfired when the Bedouins also indulged in the same destructive behavior. Thus, with the new isolation practices, there was more peace in civilian life.\n\nIsolation also allowed for more intense surveillance. The idea was to promote order through initial obedience rather than through punishment. Though this idea seems humane in nature, the change in mindset went from trust to mistrust and the consequences of disobedience were often fatal. Complete subservience was the Pasha's ultimate goal. An example of this extreme surveillance was the Tezkere. The Tezkere was a certificate with a military official's stamp of approval that allowed the soldier to leave the camp premises. The certificate specified the soldier's reason for and specific details of his absence. The soldier would be invoked to show his certificate when he traveled to prove the legitimacy of his excursion. Even outside the camp surveillance, the soldier is still closely watched.\n\nThe Pasha himself also served as a form of surveillance. The law and its strict implementation thereof gave the impression of the Pasha's constant presence. The Pasha highly regarded law and fabricated in his society a strong link between crime and punishment. If a soldier committed crime, its discovery was assumed to be definite along with the punishment thereof. For example, a deserter would receive 15 days imprisonment and 200 lashes for his crime. The harsh punishment, coupled with the fact that roll was called three times daily, dispelled any thought of desertion on the part of the soldier. The previous conception of punishment changed from vengeance to certainty. By far the biggest military reform in this period was crafting the military mindset into one of absolute obedience to prevent any want of dissent. As the soldiers left their old lives for their new military life, they learned their new place in society through their own unique law code and practice.<ref name=\"Khaled Fahmy 1997\">Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref>\n\nThe transition from corporal punishment as the official policy for punishment to imprisonment is important to the modernization of Egypt's army. The reasoning was that the law can always be applied and a soldier can always be punished for his crimes and that is a better deterrent for crimes than public physical punishments are. However, corporal punishment was not entirely removed. Oftentimes, corporal punishment, such as whipping, will be used along with imprisonment. Prison sentences were divided into three types: light house arrest, heavy house arrest, and imprisonment in the camp jail. Light house arrest had the soldier in isolation for up to two months. Heavy house arrest is limited to one month and has a guard watching over the prisoner and the last option is imprisonment in the camp jail for up to fifteen days.<ref name=\"Khaled Fahmy 1997\" />\n\nPolicies was also enacted to modernize the army in the way they are structured outside the battlefield. Soldiers were given identification numbers to use on paperwork. A wider variety of uniforms were used to differentiate between ranks. Even buildings has regulations placed on them. Tents were to be placed a set distance between each other and every building had an assigned location within the camp. All of these policies were designed to instill discipline and a sense of collective regularity in every soldier.<ref name=\"Khaled Fahmy 1997\" />\n\nPassing laws with a strict punishment regime was not sufficient for the soldiers to internalize the different army regulations that they were asked to obey. For this to succeed these soldiers had to be interned and isolated from outside influences. They then had to be taught to follow rules and regulations that came with army life. This process helped to transform the fellah into disciplined soldiers.<ref>Famhy, From peasants to soldiers: discipline and training, 138.</ref>\n\n=== The World Wars ===\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Farouk I in Military Uniform, DHP13655-10-17 01.jpg|thumb|left|King Farouk I of Egypt inspecting army units in Abdeen Square]]\nIn 1882, the independence of Egypt ended when it came under British occupation. Through it maintained a level of autonomy, it was essentially a puppet state for the British. Under British control it participated in World War I against the Ottoman Empire. \n\nIn 1914 the Egyptian Army was a largely native home-defence force. It comprised 17 battalions of infantry (8 Sudanese and 9 Egyptian), 3 companies of mounted infantry, a Camel Corps, support services and various local militia groups. It was organised, expanded and equipped by the British during the prewar years, and led by British officers. Although a few field artillery units participated voluntarily in the defence of the Suez Canal in early 1915, the Egyptian Army was primarily employed to maintain order in the troubled Sudan.<ref name=Wheal>{{cite book |last1=Wheal |first1=Elizabeth-Anne |last2=Pope |first2=Steven |date=1997 |title=The Macmillan Dictionary of The First World War |publisher=Macmillan |pages=147\u2013148 |isbn=978-0-333-68909-7}}</ref><ref name=Flaherty>{{cite web |url=https://www.ottoman-uniforms.com/1883-till-1914-army-of-egypt-infantry/ |title=1883 till 1914 Army of Egypt Infantry |last=Flaherty |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Flaherty  |website=Ottoman Uniforms |access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nBecause of the strategic importance of the Suez Canal, the Ottomans attempted [[Sinai and Palestine campaign|multiple raids and campaigns]] against the Sinai, in hopes to cut off British shipping and take British Egypt. Ultimately, the Ottomans were repulsed and the British advanced into Palestine. \n\nBy 1917 15,000 Egyptian volunteers were serving in the Egyptian Army, deployed mainly in the Sudan with three battalions in the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], along with 98,000 labourers, 23,000 of whom were serving overseas. The number of Egyptian enlistments could not be increased as conscription could threaten the production of much needed food and cotton and the stability of Egypt.<ref name=\"Falls p. 365\">Falls p. 365</ref> Also by this time, much of the railway lines in Egypt that were not crucial to the production of cotton, sugar, cereals and forages, had already been lifted and used on the military railway, except the Khedivial Railway from Alexandria to Dabaa which was available for emergencies.<ref name=\"Falls p. 365\"/> The [[Egyptian Labour Corps]] and the [[Egyptian Camel Transport Corps]] had performed invaluable service during the Sinai campaign and would perform even greater service and hardships during the coming Palestine campaign.<ref>Falls p. 367</ref>\n\nIt has been estimated that a million Egyptian soldiers participated in the [[First World War]] during the reign of [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt]], of whom half a million perished.<ref name=WWI>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |title=Egyptian army: Egypt sacrified half a million soldiers in WWI |url=https://egyptindependent.com/egyptian-army-egypt-sacrified-half-million-soldiers-wwi/ |work=Egyptian Independent |location= |access-date=28 October 2018 }}</ref>{{dubious|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Main|Egypt in World War II}}\nUpon Italian entry into World War II, it launched an invasion of Egypt from [[Cyrenaica]]. Italy sought to control the Suez but were quickly repelled in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. A British counter-offensive, [[Operation Compass|Operation Compass]], began with the invasion of Libya. After significant gains, they were repulsed by German reinforcements under German General [[Erwin Rommel]], where they reinvaded Egypt and again were pushed out after a stall in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battle of El-Alamein]].\n\n===After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952===\n[[File:Free Officers, 1953.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Free Officers gathered after the revolution. From left to right: [[Zakaria Mohieddin]], [[Abdel Latif Boghdadi (politician)|Abdel Latif Boghdadi]], [[Kamel el-Din Hussein]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (seated), [[Abdel Hakim Amer]], [[Muhammad Naguib]], [[Youssef Seddik (revolutionary)|Youssef Seddik]] and Ahmed Shawki]]\nAfter the defeat of the Egyptian army in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], a revolutionary organisation was created secretly by the Egyptian officers under the name of [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]]. This Free Officers, led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], overthrew [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] in the Egyptian Coup d'etat of 1952. The Free Officers then concluded the [[Anglo\u2013Egyptian Agreement of 1954]], with Great Britain. This agreement stated Britain would withdraw its troops based in the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=112}}\n\nThe first action for the army in the [[Cold War]] was the [[Suez Crisis]], known in Egypt and the [[Arab World]] as the ''Tripartite Aggression''. Just before the [[Suez Crisis]], politics rather than military competence was the main criterion for promotion.{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=19}} The Egyptian commander, Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]], was a purely political appointee who owed his position to his close friendship with Nasser. A heavy drinker, he would prove himself grossly incompetent as a general during the Crisis. Rigid lines between{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=19}} officers and men in the Egyptian Army led to a mutual \"mistrust and contempt\" between officers and the men who served under them.{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=20}} Egyptian troops were excellent in defensive operations, but had little capacity for offensive operations, owing to the lack of \"rapport and effective small-unit leadership\".{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=20}}\n\nTsouras writes that the mobilised strength of the army in October 1956 was 100,000, in 18 brigades (of which 10 were infantry, 2 armoured, 1 armoured training, and 1 medium machine-gun). The main manoeuvre formations were concentrated in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] (30,000 in two divisions) or in the [[Canal Zone]] (one division). The field formations were preoccupied with changing over from British and American to Soviet military equipment. But after the Israeli attack started, \"[t]he Egyptians in the Sinai never had a chance.'{{sfn|Tsouras|1994|p=127}} The Israelis seized the advantage, severed all the fragile seams in the organisation of the Egyptian forces, and destroyed their defences. Nasser ordered retreat from the Sinai which turned into a rout.<ref>Kandil, Soldiers, Spies, and Statesmen, 83.</ref>\n\nLater the army fought in the [[North Yemen Civil War]] from 1962 to 1967, and the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].\n\n====North Yemen Civil War====\n{{morefootnotes|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Egyptian army in sanaa 1962.jpg|thumb|left|widthpx|Egyptian army in Sanaa 1962]]\nWithin three months of sending troops to Yemen in 1962, Nasser realized that the engagement would require a larger commitment than anticipated.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/28/how-yemen-was-once-egypts-vietnam/?noredirect=on How Yemen was once Egypt\u2019s Vietnam]</ref> By early 1963, he would begin a four-year campaign to extricate Egyptian forces from Yemen, using an unsuccessful face-saving mechanism, only to find himself committing more troops. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. Late 1965 represented the high-water mark of Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as airborne regiments. All the Egyptian field commanders complained of a total lack of topographical maps causing a real problem in the first months of the war.\n\n====Six-Day War====\n[[File:Ground force dispositions of the United Arab Republic (Egypt) as of 1 January 1967.png|right|thumb|DIA estimate of Egyptian Army dispositions as of 1 January 1967.

On 26 May Nasser declared, \"The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel\".<ref name=\"Mutawi2002p95\">{{cite book|author=Samir A.

The Egyptian army then comprised two armoured and five infantry divisions, all deployed in the Sinai.{{sfn|Tsouras|1994|p=191}}\n\nIn the weeks before the [[Six-Day War]] began, Egypt made several significant changes to its military organisation. Field Marshal Amer created a new command interposed between the general staff and the Eastern Military District commander, Lieutenant General [[Salah ad-Din Muhsin]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=60}} This new Sinai Front Command was placed under General [[Abdel Mohsin Murtagi]], who had returned from Yemen in May 1967. Six of the seven divisions in the Sinai (with the exception of the [[20th Infantry Division (Egypt)|20th Infantry 'Palestinian' Division]]) had their commanders and chiefs of staff replaced. What fragmentary information is available suggests to authors such as Pollack that Amer was trying to improve the competence of the force, replacing political appointees with veterans of the Yemen war.\n\nAfter the war began on 5 June 1967, Israel attacked Egypt and occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The forward-deployed Egyptian forces were shattered in three places by the attacking Israelis, and a retreat to the mountain passes fifty miles east of the canal was ordered.<ref>''Makers of Modern Strategy''</ref> This developed into a rout as the Israelis harried the retreating troops from the ground and from the air.\n\n===Presidents Sadat and Mubarak===\n[[Image:Egyptian soldiers with carts.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Egyptian soldiers on the east bank. Notice the carts. Pulled by two men, these transports greatly assisted in the movement of weapons and mat\u00e9riel on the east bank, while no vehicles had yet crossed.]]\n\nAfter the 1967 debacle, two field armies, the [[Second Army (Egypt)|Second Army]] and the [[Third Army (Egypt)|Third Army]], both  stationed in the eastern part of the country, were established.\n\nThe armed forces also fought in the 1969\u20131970 [[War of Attrition]] against Israeli positions especially in the Sinai. The [[October War]] of 1973 began with a massive and successful Egyptian crossing of the [[Suez Canal]]. After crossing the cease-fire lines, Egyptian forces advanced virtually unopposed into the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The Syrians coordinated their attack on the [[Golan Heights]] to coincide with the Egyptian offensive and initially made threatening gains into Israeli-held territory. As Egyptian president [[Anwar El Sadat|Anwar Sadat]] began to worry about Syria's fortunes, he believed that capturing two strategic [[mountain pass]]es located deeper in the Sinai would make his position stronger during the negotiations. He therefore ordered the Egyptians to go back on the offensive, but the attack was quickly repulsed. The Israelis then counterattacked at the juncture of the Second and Third Armies, crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt,{{sfn|Pollack|2019|p=138-140}} and began slowly advancing southward and westward in over a week of heavy fighting which inflicted heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nOn October 22 a United Nations-brokered ceasefire quickly unraveled, with each side blaming the other for the breach. By October 24, the Israelis had improved their positions considerably and completed their encirclement of Egypt's Third Army and the city of Suez. This development led to tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. As a result, a second ceasefire was imposed cooperatively on October 25 to end the war. At the conclusion of hostilities, Israeli forces were just {{convert|42|km|mi}} from [[Damascus]] and {{convert|101|km|mi}} from [[Cairo]]. Despite being decisively beaten in battle, Egypt claimed victory in the October War because its military objective of capturing a foothold of Sinai was achieved.\n[[Image:Bridge Crossing.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Egyptian forces crossing the Suez Canal on October 7]]\nIn 1977 the army fought in the [[Libyan-Egyptian War]]. By early July 1977, the two divisions deployed to the Libyan border had been raised to full strength and were dug in. They were bolstered by several [[Sa'ka Forces|commando battalion]]s and support units, while a third division stationed near Cairo and other commandos were ready to relocate on short notice. A total of over 40,000 troops were deployed to the border during the war.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=133}}\n\nThe army had an estimated strength of 320,000 in 1989. About 180,000 of these were conscripts.{{sfn|Metz|1990|p=306}} Beyond the Second Army and Third Army in the east, most of the remaining troops were stationed in the [[Nile Delta]] region, around the upper Nile, and along the Libyan border. These troops were organised into eight military districts, later reduced to five major regions. Commando and airborne units were stationed near Cairo under central control but could be transferred quickly to one of the field armies if needed. District commanders, who generally held the rank of major general, maintained liaison with governors and other civil authorities on matters of domestic security.\n\nDecision making in the army continued to be highly centralized during the 1980s.{{sfn|Metz|1990|p=311}} Officers below brigade level rarely made tactical decisions and required the approval of higher-ranking authorities before they modified any operations. Senior army officers were aware of this situation and began taking steps to encourage initiative at the lower levels of command. A shortage of well-trained enlisted personnel became a serious problem for the army as it adopted increasingly complex weapons systems. Observers estimated in 1986 that 75 percent of all conscripts were illiterate when they entered the military.{{sfn|Metz|1990|p=311}}\n\n===1990s and after===\n[[Image:Egyptian M113 APCs during Operation Desert Shield.JPEG|left|thumb|widthpx|Egyptian soldiers with [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]s during a demonstration for visiting dignitaries, part of Operation Desert Shield.]]\nSince the 1980s the army has built closer and closer ties with the [[United States]], as evidenced in the bi-annual [[Operation Bright Star]] exercises. This cooperation eased integration of the Egyptian Army into the [[Gulf War]] coalition of 1990\u201391, during which the Egyptian II Corps under Major General [[Salah Halabi]], with 3rd Mechanized Division and [[4th Armoured Division (Egypt)|4th Armoured Division]], fought as part of the Arab Joint Forces Command North.<ref>http://www.tim-thompson.com/gwobjfg.html, accessed February 2009</ref> But the deployed force performed very poorly. It was unable to move up the first attack time after a request from overall commander U.S. General [[Norman Schwarzkopf|Norman Schwarzkopf]]; halted after 'desultory' Iraqi artillery fire; continued to move so slowly that on the morning of the third day of the war, still had not taken their first day's objectives; and could not reorient themselves in order to take up an invitation to join a ceremonial joint Arab entry into [[Kuwait City]] until Schwarzkopf was able to get [[Hosni Mubarak]] to give a direct order to the Egyptian commander to do so.{{sfn|Pollack|2019|p=65-67}}\n\nThe Army conducted Exercise Badr '96 in 1996 in the Sinai.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/1999/aug/jpost.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926204707/http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/1999/aug/jpost.htm |archivedate=2011-09-26 }}</ref> The virtual enemy during the exercise was Israel.

The modern army was established during the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (1805\u20131849), widely considered to be the \"founder of modern Egypt\". Its most significant engagements in the 20th century were in Egypt's five wars with the [[Israel|State of Israel]] (in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1967\u20131970, and 1973), one of which, the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, also saw it do combat with the armies of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[France]]. The Egyptian army was also engaged heavily in the protracted [[North Yemen Civil War]], and the brief [[Libyan-Egyptian War]] in July 1977. Its last major engagement was [[Operation Desert Storm]], the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in 1991, in which the Egyptian army constituted the second-largest contingent of the allied forces.\n\nAs of 2019, the army has an estimated strength of 380,000 soldiers, of which, approximately 130,000\u2013200,000 are professionals with the rest being conscripts.\n\n==History==\n{{for|military arrangements in antiquity|Military history of Ancient Egypt}}\n[[File:Hyksos.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Hyksos]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] drove [[chariot]]s.]]\n{{references|section|date=April 2020}}\nFor most parts of its long history, ancient Egypt was unified under one government. There were three kingdoms and two intermediate periods. During the three kingdoms Egypt was unified under one government. During the intermediate periods between kingdoms government control was in the hands of the various nomes (provinces within Egypt) and various foreigners. This circumstance set the stage for many of Egypt's military conquests. They weakened their enemies by using small projectile weapons, like bows and arrows. They also had chariots which they used to charge at the enemy.\n\nThe arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile [[Nile River]] valley. Nevertheless, the great expanses of the desert formed a barrier that protected the river valley and was almost impossible for massive armies to cross. The Egyptians built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in Nubia to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected a message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses.\n\n===Under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty===\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumbnail|Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt displaying his army and navy 1830\u20131848]]\nFollowing his [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|seizure of power]] in Egypt, and declaration of himself as [[khedive]] of the country, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] set about establishing a bona fide Egyptian military. Prior to his rule, Egypt had been governed by the [[Ottoman Empire]], and while he still technically owed fealty to the Ottoman [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], Muhammad Ali sought to gain full independence for Egypt. To further this aim, he brought in European weapons and expertise, and built an army that defeated the [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[1831 Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War|wresting control from the Porte]] of the [[Levant]], and [[Hejaz]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=14}} The Egyptian Army was involved in the following wars during Muhammad Ali's reign:\n* [[Greek War of Independence]]\n* [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)]]\n* [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u20131841)]]\n\nIn addition, Muhammed Ali Pasha utilised his army to [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquer Sudan]] in 1820-24, and unite it with Egypt. In 1882 [[Valentine Baker]] (\"Baker Pasha\") was offered the command of the newly formed Egyptian Army, which he accepted. On his arrival at [[Cairo]], however, the offer was withdrawn and he only obtained command of the Egyptian police.  In this post he devoted by far the greater amount of his energy to the training of the gendarmerie, which he realised would be the reserve of the purely military forces.{{sfn|Carr|1901}} Egypt was then involved in the long-running 1881\u201399 [[Mahdist War]] in the Sudan.\n\n====Making of a professional army====\nDuring [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s reign, the Egyptian army became a much more strictly regimented and professional army. The recruits were separated from daily civilian life and a sense of impersonal law was imposed. Muhammad Ali Pasha previously attempted to create an army of [[Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24#Sudanese slaves in Egypt|Sudanese slaves]] and [[Mamluk]]s, but most died under the intense military training and practices of the Pasha. Instead, the Pasha enforced conscription in 1822 and the new military recruits were mostly Egyptian farmers, also known as [[fellah]]. Because of harsh military practices, the 130,000 soldiers conscripted in 1822 revolted in the south in 1824.\n\nThe Pasha's goal was to create military order through indoctrination by two new major key practices: isolation and surveillance. In previous times, the wives and family were allowed to follow the army wherever they camped. This was no longer the case. The Pasha sought to create a whole new life for the soldier distinct from that of civilian life. In order to be completely indoctrinated and adapted to the military, they needed to be stripped of their daily lives, habits, and practices. Inside these barracks, soldiers were also subjected to new practices. The rules and regulations were not made to inflict punishment on the recruits but rather to impose a sense of respect for the law; the threat of punishment was enough to keep them in line and from [[deserting]]. The [[wikt:roll call|roll-call]] was taken twice a day and those found missing would be declared deserters and would have to face the punishment for their actions.<ref>Famhy, From peasants to soldiers: discipline and training, 128.</ref> Troops were kept busy to prevent the men from being left idle in the camps. The trivial tasks that filled the soldiers live was an attempt to keep the men constantly engaged in useful tasks and not thinking about leaving. There were also many other reasons why the Pasha enforced this strict isolation. Previously, soldiers would ransack towns and cause mayhem wherever they went. Military disobedience was so frequent that the [[Bedouin]]s were employed to keep the soldiers in check. Unfortunately this backfired when the Bedouins also indulged in the same destructive behavior. Thus, with the new isolation practices, there was more peace in civilian life.\n\nIsolation also allowed for more intense surveillance. The idea was to promote order through initial obedience rather than through punishment. Though this idea seems humane in nature, the change in mindset went from trust to mistrust and the consequences of disobedience were often fatal. Complete subservience was the Pasha's ultimate goal. An example of this extreme surveillance was the Tezkere. The Tezkere was a certificate with a military official's stamp of approval that allowed the soldier to leave the camp premises. The certificate specified the soldier's reason for and specific details of his absence. The soldier would be invoked to show his certificate when he traveled to prove the legitimacy of his excursion. Even outside the camp surveillance, the soldier is still closely watched.\n\nThe Pasha himself also served as a form of surveillance. The law and its strict implementation thereof gave the impression of the Pasha's constant presence. The Pasha highly regarded law and fabricated in his society a strong link between crime and punishment. If a soldier committed crime, its discovery was assumed to be definite along with the punishment thereof. For example, a deserter would receive 15 days imprisonment and 200 lashes for his crime. The harsh punishment, coupled with the fact that roll was called three times daily, dispelled any thought of desertion on the part of the soldier. The previous conception of punishment changed from vengeance to certainty. By far the biggest military reform in this period was crafting the military mindset into one of absolute obedience to prevent any want of dissent. As the soldiers left their old lives for their new military life, they learned their new place in society through their own unique law code and practice.<ref name=\"Khaled Fahmy 1997\">Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref>\n\nThe transition from corporal punishment as the official policy for punishment to imprisonment is important to the modernization of Egypt's army. The reasoning was that the law can always be applied and a soldier can always be punished for his crimes and that is a better deterrent for crimes than public physical punishments are. However, corporal punishment was not entirely removed. Oftentimes, corporal punishment, such as whipping, will be used along with imprisonment. Prison sentences were divided into three types: light house arrest, heavy house arrest, and imprisonment in the camp jail. Light house arrest had the soldier in isolation for up to two months. Heavy house arrest is limited to one month and has a guard watching over the prisoner and the last option is imprisonment in the camp jail for up to fifteen days.<ref name=\"Khaled Fahmy 1997\" />\n\nPolicies was also enacted to modernize the army in the way they are structured outside the battlefield. Soldiers were given identification numbers to use on paperwork. A wider variety of uniforms were used to differentiate between ranks. Even buildings has regulations placed on them. Tents were to be placed a set distance between each other and every building had an assigned location within the camp. All of these policies were designed to instill discipline and a sense of collective regularity in every soldier.<ref name=\"Khaled Fahmy 1997\" />\n\nPassing laws with a strict punishment regime was not sufficient for the soldiers to internalize the different army regulations that they were asked to obey. For this to succeed these soldiers had to be interned and isolated from outside influences. They then had to be taught to follow rules and regulations that came with army life. This process helped to transform the fellah into disciplined soldiers.<ref>Famhy, From peasants to soldiers: discipline and training, 138.</ref>\n\n=== The World Wars ===\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Farouk I in Military Uniform, DHP13655-10-17 01.jpg|thumb|left|King Farouk I of Egypt inspecting army units in Abdeen Square]]\nIn 1882, the independence of Egypt ended when it came under British occupation. Through it maintained a level of autonomy, it was essentially a puppet state for the British. Under British control it participated in World War I against the Ottoman Empire. \n\nIn 1914 the Egyptian Army was a largely native home-defence force. It comprised 17 battalions of infantry (8 Sudanese and 9 Egyptian), 3 companies of mounted infantry, a Camel Corps, support services and various local militia groups. It was organised, expanded and equipped by the British during the prewar years, and led by British officers. Although a few field artillery units participated voluntarily in the defence of the Suez Canal in early 1915, the Egyptian Army was primarily employed to maintain order in the troubled Sudan.<ref name=Wheal>{{cite book |last1=Wheal |first1=Elizabeth-Anne |last2=Pope |first2=Steven |date=1997 |title=The Macmillan Dictionary of The First World War |publisher=Macmillan |pages=147\u2013148 |isbn=978-0-333-68909-7}}</ref><ref name=Flaherty>{{cite web |url=https://www.ottoman-uniforms.com/1883-till-1914-army-of-egypt-infantry/ |title=1883 till 1914 Army of Egypt Infantry |last=Flaherty |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Flaherty  |website=Ottoman Uniforms |access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nBecause of the strategic importance of the Suez Canal, the Ottomans attempted [[Sinai and Palestine campaign|multiple raids and campaigns]] against the Sinai, in hopes to cut off British shipping and take British Egypt. Ultimately, the Ottomans were repulsed and the British advanced into Palestine. \n\nBy 1917 15,000 Egyptian volunteers were serving in the Egyptian Army, deployed mainly in the Sudan with three battalions in the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], along with 98,000 labourers, 23,000 of whom were serving overseas. The number of Egyptian enlistments could not be increased as conscription could threaten the production of much needed food and cotton and the stability of Egypt.<ref name=\"Falls p. 365\">Falls p. 365</ref> Also by this time, much of the railway lines in Egypt that were not crucial to the production of cotton, sugar, cereals and forages, had already been lifted and used on the military railway, except the Khedivial Railway from Alexandria to Dabaa which was available for emergencies.<ref name=\"Falls p. 365\"/> The [[Egyptian Labour Corps]] and the [[Egyptian Camel Transport Corps]] had performed invaluable service during the Sinai campaign and would perform even greater service and hardships during the coming Palestine campaign.<ref>Falls p. 367</ref>\n\nIt has been estimated that a million Egyptian soldiers participated in the [[First World War]] during the reign of [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt]], of whom half a million perished.<ref name=WWI>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |title=Egyptian army: Egypt sacrified half a million soldiers in WWI |url=https://egyptindependent.com/egyptian-army-egypt-sacrified-half-million-soldiers-wwi/ |work=Egyptian Independent |location= |access-date=28 October 2018 }}</ref>{{dubious|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Main|Egypt in World War II}}\nUpon Italian entry into World War II, it launched an invasion of Egypt from [[Cyrenaica]]. Italy sought to control the Suez but were quickly repelled in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. A British counter-offensive, [[Operation Compass|Operation Compass]], began with the invasion of Libya. After significant gains, they were repulsed by German reinforcements under German General [[Erwin Rommel]], where they reinvaded Egypt and again were pushed out after a stall in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battle of El-Alamein]].\n\n===After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952===\n[[File:Free Officers, 1953.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Free Officers gathered after the revolution.

This Free Officers, led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], overthrew [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] in the Egyptian Coup d'etat of 1952. The Free Officers then concluded the [[Anglo\u2013Egyptian Agreement of 1954]], with Great Britain. This agreement stated Britain would withdraw its troops based in the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=112}}\n\nThe first action for the army in the [[Cold War]] was the [[Suez Crisis]], known in Egypt and the [[Arab World]] as the ''Tripartite Aggression''. Just before the [[Suez Crisis]], politics rather than military competence was the main criterion for promotion.{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=19}} The Egyptian commander, Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]], was a purely political appointee who owed his position to his close friendship with Nasser. A heavy drinker, he would prove himself grossly incompetent as a general during the Crisis. Rigid lines between{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=19}} officers and men in the Egyptian Army led to a mutual \"mistrust and contempt\" between officers and the men who served under them.{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=20}} Egyptian troops were excellent in defensive operations, but had little capacity for offensive operations, owing to the lack of \"rapport and effective small-unit leadership\".{{sfn|Varble|2003|p=20}}\n\nTsouras writes that the mobilised strength of the army in October 1956 was 100,000, in 18 brigades (of which 10 were infantry, 2 armoured, 1 armoured training, and 1 medium machine-gun). The main manoeuvre formations were concentrated in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] (30,000 in two divisions) or in the [[Canal Zone]] (one division). The field formations were preoccupied with changing over from British and American to Soviet military equipment. But after the Israeli attack started, \"[t]he Egyptians in the Sinai never had a chance.'{{sfn|Tsouras|1994|p=127}} The Israelis seized the advantage, severed all the fragile seams in the organisation of the Egyptian forces, and destroyed their defences. Nasser ordered retreat from the Sinai which turned into a rout.<ref>Kandil, Soldiers, Spies, and Statesmen, 83.</ref>\n\nLater the army fought in the [[North Yemen Civil War]] from 1962 to 1967, and the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].\n\n====North Yemen Civil War====\n{{morefootnotes|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Egyptian army in sanaa 1962.jpg|thumb|left|widthpx|Egyptian army in Sanaa 1962]]\nWithin three months of sending troops to Yemen in 1962, Nasser realized that the engagement would require a larger commitment than anticipated.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/28/how-yemen-was-once-egypts-vietnam/?noredirect=on How Yemen was once Egypt\u2019s Vietnam]</ref> By early 1963, he would begin a four-year campaign to extricate Egyptian forces from Yemen, using an unsuccessful face-saving mechanism, only to find himself committing more troops. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. Late 1965 represented the high-water mark of Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as airborne regiments. All the Egyptian field commanders complained of a total lack of topographical maps causing a real problem in the first months of the war.\n\n====Six-Day War====\n[[File:Ground force dispositions of the United Arab Republic (Egypt) as of 1 January 1967.png|right|thumb|DIA estimate of Egyptian Army dispositions as of 1 January 1967.

The Egyptian army then comprised two armoured and five infantry divisions, all deployed in the Sinai.{{sfn|Tsouras|1994|p=191}}\n\nIn the weeks before the [[Six-Day War]] began, Egypt made several significant changes to its military organisation. Field Marshal Amer created a new command interposed between the general staff and the Eastern Military District commander, Lieutenant General [[Salah ad-Din Muhsin]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=60}} This new Sinai Front Command was placed under General [[Abdel Mohsin Murtagi]], who had returned from Yemen in May 1967. Six of the seven divisions in the Sinai (with the exception of the [[20th Infantry Division (Egypt)|20th Infantry 'Palestinian' Division]]) had their commanders and chiefs of staff replaced. What fragmentary information is available suggests to authors such as Pollack that Amer was trying to improve the competence of the force, replacing political appointees with veterans of the Yemen war.\n\nAfter the war began on 5 June 1967, Israel attacked Egypt and occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The forward-deployed Egyptian forces were shattered in three places by the attacking Israelis, and a retreat to the mountain passes fifty miles east of the canal was ordered.<ref>''Makers of Modern Strategy''</ref> This developed into a rout as the Israelis harried the retreating troops from the ground and from the air.\n\n===Presidents Sadat and Mubarak===\n[[Image:Egyptian soldiers with carts.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Egyptian soldiers on the east bank. Notice the carts. Pulled by two men, these transports greatly assisted in the movement of weapons and mat\u00e9riel on the east bank, while no vehicles had yet crossed.]]\n\nAfter the 1967 debacle, two field armies, the [[Second Army (Egypt)|Second Army]] and the [[Third Army (Egypt)|Third Army]], both  stationed in the eastern part of the country, were established.\n\nThe armed forces also fought in the 1969\u20131970 [[War of Attrition]] against Israeli positions especially in the Sinai. The [[October War]] of 1973 began with a massive and successful Egyptian crossing of the [[Suez Canal]]. After crossing the cease-fire lines, Egyptian forces advanced virtually unopposed into the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The Syrians coordinated their attack on the [[Golan Heights]] to coincide with the Egyptian offensive and initially made threatening gains into Israeli-held territory. As Egyptian president [[Anwar El Sadat|Anwar Sadat]] began to worry about Syria's fortunes, he believed that capturing two strategic [[mountain pass]]es located deeper in the Sinai would make his position stronger during the negotiations. He therefore ordered the Egyptians to go back on the offensive, but the attack was quickly repulsed. The Israelis then counterattacked at the juncture of the Second and Third Armies, crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt,{{sfn|Pollack|2019|p=138-140}} and began slowly advancing southward and westward in over a week of heavy fighting which inflicted heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nOn October 22 a United Nations-brokered ceasefire quickly unraveled, with each side blaming the other for the breach. By October 24, the Israelis had improved their positions considerably and completed their encirclement of Egypt's Third Army and the city of Suez. This development led to tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. As a result, a second ceasefire was imposed cooperatively on October 25 to end the war. At the conclusion of hostilities, Israeli forces were just {{convert|42|km|mi}} from [[Damascus]] and {{convert|101|km|mi}} from [[Cairo]]. Despite being decisively beaten in battle, Egypt claimed victory in the October War because its military objective of capturing a foothold of Sinai was achieved.\n[[Image:Bridge Crossing.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Egyptian forces crossing the Suez Canal on October 7]]\nIn 1977 the army fought in the [[Libyan-Egyptian War]]. By early July 1977, the two divisions deployed to the Libyan border had been raised to full strength and were dug in. They were bolstered by several [[Sa'ka Forces|commando battalion]]s and support units, while a third division stationed near Cairo and other commandos were ready to relocate on short notice. A total of over 40,000 troops were deployed to the border during the war.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=133}}\n\nThe army had an estimated strength of 320,000 in 1989. About 180,000 of these were conscripts.{{sfn|Metz|1990|p=306}} Beyond the Second Army and Third Army in the east, most of the remaining troops were stationed in the [[Nile Delta]] region, around the upper Nile, and along the Libyan border. These troops were organised into eight military districts, later reduced to five major regions. Commando and airborne units were stationed near Cairo under central control but could be transferred quickly to one of the field armies if needed. District commanders, who generally held the rank of major general, maintained liaison with governors and other civil authorities on matters of domestic security.\n\nDecision making in the army continued to be highly centralized during the 1980s.{{sfn|Metz|1990|p=311}} Officers below brigade level rarely made tactical decisions and required the approval of higher-ranking authorities before they modified any operations. Senior army officers were aware of this situation and began taking steps to encourage initiative at the lower levels of command. A shortage of well-trained enlisted personnel became a serious problem for the army as it adopted increasingly complex weapons systems. Observers estimated in 1986 that 75 percent of all conscripts were illiterate when they entered the military.{{sfn|Metz|1990|p=311}}\n\n===1990s and after===\n[[Image:Egyptian M113 APCs during Operation Desert Shield.JPEG|left|thumb|widthpx|Egyptian soldiers with [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]s during a demonstration for visiting dignitaries, part of Operation Desert Shield.]]\nSince the 1980s the army has built closer and closer ties with the [[United States]], as evidenced in the bi-annual [[Operation Bright Star]] exercises. This cooperation eased integration of the Egyptian Army into the [[Gulf War]] coalition of 1990\u201391, during which the Egyptian II Corps under Major General [[Salah Halabi]], with 3rd Mechanized Division and [[4th Armoured Division (Egypt)|4th Armoured Division]], fought as part of the Arab Joint Forces Command North.<ref>http://www.tim-thompson.com/gwobjfg.html, accessed February 2009</ref> But the deployed force performed very poorly.

He entered the first match of the series as the reigning [[King of Dark Championship|King of Dark Champion]] and defeated Dai Suzuki in less than a minute to lose the title (per the rules of this championship, the title is awarded to the loser of the match). After that, he defeated Gorgeous Matsuno but lost to [[Masato Shibata|Mad Paulie]], former [[mixed martial artist]] [[Ryo Kawamura|Rocky Kawamura]] and [[Munenori Sawa|Lingerie Mutoh]] in quick succession.\n\nThe second match of the undercard was a [[Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)#Rumble rules battle royals|Rumble rules match]] for the [[Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship]]. Former [[NEO Japan Ladies Pro-Wrestling]] president and CEO Tetsuya Koda was the 1,269th champion entering the match first. He was pinned by Nodoka-Oneesan who became the 1,270th champion. Nodoka was eliminated by Mizuki (1,271st champion) who was then eliminated by Yuu who won the match and became the 1,272nd champion.\n\nOn the main card, first was a [[tag team match]] that saw the DDT debut of Yuki Iino.\n\nNext was a match for the inaugural [[KO-D 10-Man Tag Team Championship]], a title meant for teams of five wrestlers.\n\nNext was a match pitting [[Jiro Kuroshio|Jiro \"Ikemen\" Kuroshio]] from [[Wrestle-1]] against Shunma Katsumata. This match was dubbed the {{nihongo|\"[[Ikemen]] vs. [[Japanese idol|Idol]]!

The match was fought under a \"no touch\" rule meaning that, unlike in a classic tag team four-way match, each team always had a legal man in the ring. \n\nIn the next match, [[Dick Togo]], Yasu Urano and Antonio Honda challenged ''Shuten-d\u014dji'' ([[Kudo (wrestler)|Kudo]], [[Yukio Sakaguchi]] and [[Masahiro Takanashi]]) for the [[KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship]].\n\nNext, [[Danshoku Dino]] and [[Sanshiro Takagi]] faced each other in a \"[[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de apuestas|Full Authority vs. Marriage]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Weapon-based variations|Weapon Rumble]]\" match in which various weapons secretly chosen by the participants beforehand were being introduced one after another at regular intervals. Dino won the bout and, as a result, gained full authority over DDT. Had Takagi won, Dino would have been forced to get married. As part of the \"weapons\" used in the match, [[Kendo Kashin]] and [[Mitsuo Momota]] (accompanied by his family) fought in an impromptu Weapon match that quickly ended in a [[No contest (professional wrestling)|no contest]].\n\nNext was a [[DDT Extreme Division Championship]] match between challenger Akito and champion [[Daisuke Sasaki]]. Per the rules of the title, the champion chooses the stipulation of the matches. Sasaki decided that this match would be a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de apuestas|Hair vs. Hair]] (here dubbed as ''Cabellera Contra Cabellera'') [[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Submission match|Submission match]].\n\nNext, [[Harashima]] and [[Naomichi Marufuji]] challenged [[Shigehiro Irie]] and Kazusada Higuchi for the [[KO-D Tag Team Championship]] in a match sponsored by Uchicomi!.\n\nIn the main event, [[Tetsuya Endo (wrestler)|Tetsuya Endo]] challenged [[Konosuke Takeshita]] for the [[KO-D Openweight Championship]].

This was the final spin-off to feature [[Alan Reed]] as the voice of Fred Flintstone before Reed's death in 1977.\n\nFor the 1973\u201374 television season, CBS dropped ''The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show'' episodes and repackaged the first half-hour segments of ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour'' for a second season of reruns under the new title ''The Flintstone Comedy Show'' from September 8, 1973, to January 26, 1974.

They performed two songs per episode which included:\n\n# \"Sunshine Man\"\n# \"Summertime Girl\"\n# \"Oh, How I Love You\"\n# \"Keep in Time\"\n# \"It Should Always Be Saturday\"\n# \"Hop, Skip and a Jump\"\n# \"Flying So High\"\n# \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\"\n# \"Shadow, Shadow\"\n# \"Being With You\"\n# \"Singing Song\"\n# \"Song of the Season\"\n# \"What's Your Sign?\"\n# \"Sunny Sun Day\"\n# \"Rock N Roll Circus\"\n\nThe music was written by various [[Screen Gems]] staffers, which at the time included [[David Gates]] (later of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]) penning the popular \"Summertime Girl\" and Tony Dancy (of Tony's Tygers) writing with Craig Fairchild & Jackie Mills on \"Being With You\". Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber. This lineup would record on hundreds of commercials, TV themes and [[The Partridge Family discography|The Partridge Family]] recordings. Bahler's lead vocals are also prominent with the group [[The Love Generation]] who had a few LPs in the late 1960s as well.\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode contained two shorts featuring the traditional antics and adventures of '''Fred and Barney''' and one short featuring '''Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm''' with their friends Moonrock, Penny, Wiggy, Schleprock, Cindy and Fabian, and the Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub and Zonk).\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:20px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#FFD700\"| Titles\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Birdbrained / Squawkie Talkies / Bedrock 500\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''Bird Brained:''' Fred has to birdsit Mr. Slate's pet parrot, Claymore, who causes nothing but trouble for the Flintstones and the Rubbles.\n* '''Squawkie Talkies:''' Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm mistakenly believe that Barney is eaten by a Hipposaurus while using Moonrock's \"squawkie talkie\" gadgets.\n* '''Bedrock 500:''' Bamm-Bamm and Moonrock, Pebbles and her girlfriends participate in the Bedrock 500 car race against the Bronto Bunch.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| Title = The Flying Fools / Bedlam in Bedrock / The Stone Ranger Rides Again\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|16}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''The Flying Fools:''' Fred and Barney experience a turbulent afternoon while flying in Moonrock's new self-made airplane.\n* '''Bedlam in Bedrock:''' Pebbles and her friends try to help Radio R.O.C.K.

They performed two songs per episode which included:\n\n# \"Sunshine Man\"\n# \"Summertime Girl\"\n# \"Oh, How I Love You\"\n# \"Keep in Time\"\n# \"It Should Always Be Saturday\"\n# \"Hop, Skip and a Jump\"\n# \"Flying So High\"\n# \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\"\n# \"Shadow, Shadow\"\n# \"Being With You\"\n# \"Singing Song\"\n# \"Song of the Season\"\n# \"What's Your Sign?\"\n# \"Sunny Sun Day\"\n# \"Rock N Roll Circus\"\n\nThe music was written by various [[Screen Gems]] staffers, which at the time included [[David Gates]] (later of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]) penning the popular \"Summertime Girl\" and Tony Dancy (of Tony's Tygers) writing with Craig Fairchild & Jackie Mills on \"Being With You\". Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber. This lineup would record on hundreds of commercials, TV themes and [[The Partridge Family discography|The Partridge Family]] recordings.
