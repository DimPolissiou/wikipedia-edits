Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity from the ancient world.  Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century ('chars branlant' or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century.<ref name=\"Munby\" >{{Citation| last =Munby | first =Julian | contribution =From Carriage to Coach: What Happened? | year = 2008| title =The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel| editor-last1 =Bork| editor-first1 =Robert|editor-last2=Kahn| editor-first2 =Andrea| volume =| pages =41\u201353| place = | publisher =Ashgate| id = }}</ref>  Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded.  These carriages were on four wheels often and were pulled by two to four horses depending on how they were decorated (elaborate decoration with gold lining made the carriage heavier).  Wood and iron were the primary requirements needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.\n\nAnother form of carriage was the [[pageant wagon]] of the 14th century.  Historians debate the structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels depending on the size of the wagon.  The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or 3 wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon.  Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal axle systems, which allowed the wheels to turn.  Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal axle systems were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns.  Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles.  Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels.  This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.\n\n===Coach===\n{{Main|Coach (carriage)}}\n[[File:Koets Brussel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.14|A Gala Coup\u00e9, 18th century; [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], Brussels]]\nOne of the great innovations of the carriage was the invention of the suspended carriage or the ''chariot branlant'' (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain).  The 'chariot branlant' of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed.<ref>L\u00e9on marquis De Laborde. ''Glossaire fran\u00e7ais du Moyen Age''.

In the 15th century, carriages were made lighter and needed only one horse to haul the carriage. This carriage was designed and innovated in [[Hungary]].<ref>Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. p. 263.</ref> Both innovations appeared around the same time and historians believe that people began comparing the chariot branlant and the Hungarian light coach.  However, the earliest illustrations of the Hungarian 'Kochi-wagon' do not indicate any suspension, and often the use of three horses in harness.\n\nUnder King [[Mathias Corvinus]] (1458\u201390), who enjoyed fast travel, the Hungarians developed fast road transport, and the town of [[Kocs]] between [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] became an important post-town, and gave its name to the new vehicle type.<ref>{{Cite OED 1933|Coach}}</ref> The Hungarian [[Coach (carriage)|coach]] was highly praised because it was capable of holding 8 men, used light wheels, could be towed by only one horse (it may have been suspended by leather straps, but this is a topic of debate).<ref name=\"Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264\">Baofu, Peter.

As it moved throughout Europe in the late 16th century, the coach's body structure was ultimately changed, from a round-top to the 'four-poster' carriages that became standard by c.1600.<ref name=\"Munby\" />\n\n===Later development of the coach===\n[[File:James Pollard - The London-Faringdon Coach passing Buckland House, Berkshire - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The London-Farringdon coach, 1835]]\nThe coach had doors in the side, with an iron step protected by leather that became the \"boot\" in which servants might ride.  The driver sat on a seat at the front, and the most important occupant sat in the back facing forwards.  The earliest coaches can be seen at Veste Coburg, Lisbon, and the Moscow Kremlin, and they become a commonplace in European art.  It was not until the 17th century that further innovations with steel springs and glazing took place, and only in the 18th century, with better road surfaces, was there a major innovation with the introduction of the steel [[Spring (device)|C-spring]].<ref>Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'.' Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.</ref>\n\nIt was not until the 18th century that steering systems were truly improved. [[Erasmus Darwin]] was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England.  Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage.  First, the front wheels were turned by a pivoting front axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road.  Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.\n\nA pivoting front axle changes a carriage's base from a rectangle to a triangle because the wheel on the inside of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as [[Ackermann steering]].  Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.\n\nCarriage use in North America came with the establishment of European settlers.  Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest.  Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south.  Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people.  As in Europe, chariots, coaches and/or carriages were a mark of status.  The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation.  As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons.  Upon the turn of the 18th century wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high.  Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed based on the number of wheels they had.  These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North.  Europe, however, still used carriage transportation far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.\n[[File:Naghs Jahan Horses.JPG|thumb|upright=1.14|Tourists horse-drawn taxis in [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]], Esfahan.]]\n\nCarriages and coaches began to disappear as use of steam propulsion began to generate more and more interest and research.  Steam power quickly won the battle against animal power as is evident by a newspaper article written in England in 1895 entitled \"Horseflesh vs. Steam\".<ref>Mechanical Road Carriages: Horseflesh V. Steam. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1823 (7 December 1895), pp.&nbsp;1434\u20131435. BMJ Publishing Group</ref>  The article highlights the death of the carriage as the means of transportation.\n\nNowadays, carriages are still used for day-to-day transport in the United States by some minority groups such as the [[Amish]]. They are also still used in the tourism as vehicles for [[sightseeing]] in cities such as [[Bruges]], Vienna, [[New Orleans]], and [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].\n\nThe most complete working collection of carriages can be seen at the [[Royal Mews]] in London where a large selection of vehicles is in regular use.  These are supported by a staff of liveried coachmen, footmen and [[postillion]]s.  The horses earn their keep by supporting the work of the Royal Household, particularly during ceremonial events.  Horses pulling a large carriage known as a \"covered brake\" collect the Yeoman of the Guard in their distinctive red uniforms from St James's Palace for Investitures at Buckingham Palace; High Commissioners or Ambassadors are driven to their audiences with The Queen in [[landau (carriage)|landaus]]; visiting heads of state are transported to and from official arrival ceremonies and members of the Royal Family are driven in Royal Mews coaches during Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle and carriage processions at the beginning of each day of Royal Ascot.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Body===\n[[File:Elizabethboweslyonandkinggeorgeincanada.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|right|[[George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] in a landau with footmen and a postillion, riding on the near wheel horse, controlling both teams of horses. Canada, 1939]]\nCarriages may be enclosed or open, depending on the type.<ref>{{cite web | title=Horse Carriage Parts Horse Drawn Vehicle | url=http://www.liveryone.net/parts.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=30 October 2003 | accessdate=30 January 2008}}</ref> The top cover for the body of a carriage, called the ''head'' or ''hood'', is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a ''bellows top'' or ''[[calash]]''. A ''hoopstick'' forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a closed carriage, especially a diligence, was called an ''imperial''. A closed carriage may have side windows called ''quarter lights'' (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a \"glass coach\". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a ''[[dashboard]]'' intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a ''wing'' (British). A ''foot iron'' or ''footplate'' may serve as a carriage step.\n\nA carriage driver sits on a ''box'' or ''perch'', usually elevated and small. When at the front it is known as a ''dickey box'', a term also used for a seat at the back for servants. A [[footman]] might use a small platform at the rear called a ''footboard'' or a seat called a ''[[rumble seat|rumble]]'' behind the body. Some carriages have a moveable seat called a ''jump seat''. Some seats had an attached backrest called a ''lazyback''.\n\nThe shafts of a carriage were called ''limbers'' in English dialect. ''Lancewood'', a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A ''holdback'', consisting of an iron catch on the shaft with a looped strap, enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the ''yoke''. At the end of a [[trace (tack)|trace]], a loop called a ''cockeye'' attaches to the carriage.\n\nIn some carriage types the body is suspended from several leather straps called ''braces'' or ''thoroughbraces'', attached to or serving as springs.\n\n===Undercarriage===\nBeneath the carriage body is the ''undergear'' or ''undercarriage'' (or simply ''carriage''), consisting of the running gear and chassis.<ref>{{cite web | title=Basic Carriage Gear Horse Drawn Vehicles | url=http://www.liveryone.net/gear.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=2 November 2003 | accessdate=30 January 2008}}</ref> The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the ''running gear''. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle at the ends of a bar or beam called an ''axle'' or ''axletree''. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or ''forecarriage'', is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a [[dropped axle]], bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows for a low body with large wheels. A guard called a ''dirtboard'' keeps dirt from the axle arm.\n\nSeveral structural members form parts of the chassis supporting the carriage body. The fore axletree and the splinter bar above it (supporting the springs) are united by a piece of wood or metal called a [[futchel]], which forms a socket for the pole that extends from the front axle. For strength and support, a rod called the ''[[backstay]]'' may extend from either end of the rear axle to the reach, the pole or rod joining the hind axle to the forward bolster above the front axle.\n\nA skid called a ''drag'', ''[[dragshoe]]'', ''shoe'' or ''[[skidpan]]'' retards the motion of the wheels. A London patent of 1841 describes one such apparatus: \"An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle\". The original feature of this modification was that instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver's position) so that it is allowed  to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of \"pendant-levers\" and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position  and be ready for further use.<ref>Patent 9020, 7 July 1841, awarded to Thomas Fuller, a coach-builder of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]</ref>\n\nA catch or block called a ''trigger'' may be used to hold a wheel on an incline.\n\nA horizontal wheel or segment of a wheel called a ''[[fifth wheel]]'' sometimes forms an extended support to prevent the carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt or perchbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a ''headblock'' might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.\n\n=== Fittings ===\nMany of these fittings were carried over to [[horseless carriage]]s and evolved into the modern elements of automobiles. During the [[Brass Era car|Brass Era]] they were often the same parts on either type of carriage (i.e., horse-drawn or horseless). \n* Upholstery (trimming): traditionally similar to the [[upholstery]] of furniture; evolved into car interior ulholstery such as [[car seat]]s and door trim panels\n* Carriage lamps: typically [[oil lamp]]s for centuries, although [[carbide lamp]]s and battery-powered [[electric light|electric lamp]]s were also used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; evolved into car [[headlamp]]s\n* Trunk: a [[trunk (luggage)|luggage trunk]] serving the same purpose as, and which gave its name to, later [[trunk (car)|car trunks]]\n* [[Toolbox]]: a small box with enough [[hand tool]]s to make simple repairs on the roadside\n* [[Blanket]]s: in winter, blankets for the driver and passengers and often [[horse blanket]]s as well\n* [[Running board]]: a step to assist in climbing onto the carriage and also sometimes a place for [[standing passenger]]s\n* [[Shovel]]: useful for mud and snow in the roadway, to free the carriage from being stuck; was especially important in the era when most roads were [[dirt road]]s, often with deep [[rut (roads)|ruts]]\n* [[Whip#Buggy whip and coachwhip|Buggy whip or coachwhip]]: whips for the horses. For obvious reasons, this is one of the components of carriage equipment that did not carry over from horse-drawn carriages to horseless carriages, and that fact has made such whips one of the prototypical or stereotypical examples of products whose manufacture is subject to [[disruptive innovation]]\n\n==Carriage terminology==\n[[File:HansomCab.jpg|thumb|[[Hansom]] cab and driver adding character to period filming]]\n[[File:WeddingCarriage.JPG|thumb|[[Bride]] descending from a decorated wedding carriage]]\n[[File:Cartelajf.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Cartela (or \"Kartela\", a [[Philippine]] horse carriage, in art (8 Waves Waterpark & Hotel [http://www.8waveswaterpark.com.ph/][[San Rafael, Bulacan]]).]]\nA person whose business was to drive a carriage was a ''[[coachman]]''. A servant in livery called a ''[[footman]]'' or ''piquer'' formerly served in attendance upon a rider or was required to run before his master's carriage to clear the way. An attendant on horseback called an ''outrider'' often rode ahead of or next to a carriage. A ''carriage starter'' directed the flow of vehicles taking on passengers at the curbside. A ''hackneyman'' hired out horses and carriages. When hawking wares, a ''hawker'' was often assisted by a carriage.\n\nUpper-class people of wealth and social position, those wealthy enough to keep carriages, were referred to as ''carriage folk'' or ''carriage trade''.\n\nCarriage passengers often used a ''lap robe'' as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet. A ''buffalo robe'', made from the hide of an [[American bison]] dressed with the hair on, was sometimes used as a carriage robe; it was commonly trimmed to rectangular shape and lined on the skin side with fabric. A ''carriage boot'', fur-trimmed for winter wear, was made usually of fabric with a fur or felt lining. A ''knee boot'' protected the knees from rain or splatter.\n\nA horse especially bred for carriage use by appearance and stylish action is called a ''carriage horse''; one for use on a road is a ''road horse''. One such breed is the ''[[Cleveland Bay]]'', uniformly [[Bay (horse)|bay]] in color, of good conformation and strong constitution. Horses were broken in using a bodiless carriage frame called a ''break'' or ''brake''.\n\nA ''[[carriage dog]]'' or ''coach dog'' is bred for running beside a carriage.\n\nA roofed structure that extends from the entrance of a building over an adjacent driveway and that shelters callers as they get in or out of their vehicles is known as a ''carriage porch'' or ''[[porte cochere]]''. An outbuilding for a carriage is a ''coach house'', which was often combined with accommodation for a [[groom]] or other servants.\n\nA ''[[livery stable]]'' kept horses and usually carriages for hire. A range of stables, usually with ''[[carriage house]]s'' (''remises'') and living quarters built around a yard, court or street, is called a ''[[mews]]''.\n\nA kind of dynamometer called a ''peirameter'' indicates the power necessary to haul a carriage over a road or track.\n\n==Competitive driving==\n{{Main|Driving (horse)|Combined driving|Draft horse showing|Roadster (horse)}}\n[[File:Horse carriage at FEI European Dressage Championship 02.jpg|thumb|A horse carriage at European Dressage Championship]]\nIn most European and English-speaking countries, driving is a competitive equestrian sport. Many [[horse show]]s host driving competitions for a particular style of driving, breed of horse, or type of vehicle. Show vehicles are usually carriages, [[cart]]s, or [[horse and buggy|buggies]] and, occasionally, [[sulky|sulkies]] or [[wagon]]s. Modern high-technology carriages are made purely for competition by companies such as Bennington Carriages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bennington.co.uk |title=Bennington Carriages homepage}}</ref> in England.\nTerminology varies: the simple, lightweight two- or four-wheeled show vehicle common in many nations is called a \"cart\" in the USA, but a \"carriage\" in Australia.\n\nInternationally, there is intense competition in the all-round test of driving: [[combined driving]], also known as ''horse-driving trials'', an equestrian discipline regulated by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale]] (International Equestrian Federation) with national organizations representing each member country. World championships are conducted in alternate years, including single-horse, horse pairs and four-in-hand championships. The [[World Equestrian Games]], held at four-year intervals, also includes a four-in-hand competition.\n\nFor [[pony]] drivers, the World Combined Pony Championships are held every two years and include singles, pairs and four-in-hand events.\n\n==Types of horse-drawn carriages==\n[[File:Wien Stefansdom fiaker DSC02643.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.91|In Vienna, rental [[Landau (carriage)|landau]]s called ''[[Fiacre (carriage)|Fiacre]]s'' carry tourists around the old city.]]\n\nAn almost bewildering variety of horse-drawn carriages existed. Arthur Ingram's ''Horse Drawn Vehicles since 1760 in Colour'' lists 325 types with a short description of each. By the early 19th century one's choice of carriage was only in part based on practicality and performance; it was also a status statement and subject to changing fashions.

With the decline of these city-states and kingdoms, these techniques almost disappeared.\n\n===Medieval carriage===\n[[File:Kobelwagen, Jean Le Tavernier, nach 1455.jpg|thumb|upright|Horse-drawn wagon, c. 1455]]\n[[File:A two-tiered carriage drawn by four elephants.jpg|thumb|A two-tiered carriage drawn by four elephants]]\nThe medieval carriage was typically a four-wheeled wagon type, with a rounded top ('tilt') similar in appearance to the [[Conestoga Wagon]] familiar from the United States.  Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity from the ancient world.  Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century ('chars branlant' or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century.<ref name=\"Munby\" >{{Citation| last =Munby | first =Julian | contribution =From Carriage to Coach: What Happened? | year = 2008| title =The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel| editor-last1 =Bork| editor-first1 =Robert|editor-last2=Kahn| editor-first2 =Andrea| volume =| pages =41\u201353| place = | publisher =Ashgate| id = }}</ref>  Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded.  These carriages were on four wheels often and were pulled by two to four horses depending on how they were decorated (elaborate decoration with gold lining made the carriage heavier).  Wood and iron were the primary requirements needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.\n\nAnother form of carriage was the [[pageant wagon]] of the 14th century.  Historians debate the structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels depending on the size of the wagon.  The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or 3 wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon.  Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal axle systems, which allowed the wheels to turn.  Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal axle systems were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns.  Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles.  Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels.  This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.\n\n===Coach===\n{{Main|Coach (carriage)}}\n[[File:Koets Brussel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.14|A Gala Coup\u00e9, 18th century; [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], Brussels]]\nOne of the great innovations of the carriage was the invention of the suspended carriage or the ''chariot branlant'' (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain).  The 'chariot branlant' of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed.<ref>L\u00e9on marquis De Laborde. ''Glossaire fran\u00e7ais du Moyen Age''. Labitte, Paris, 1872. p. 208.</ref><ref>{{Citation| last =Munby | first =Julian | contribution =From Carriage to Coach: What Happened? | year = 2008| title =The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel| editor-last1 =Bork| editor-first1 =Robert|editor-last2=Kahn| editor-first2 =Andrea| volume =| page =45| place = | publisher =Ashgate| id = }}</ref> Chains provided a smoother ride in the chariot branlant because the compartment no longer rested on the turning axles. In the 15th century, carriages were made lighter and needed only one horse to haul the carriage. This carriage was designed and innovated in [[Hungary]].<ref>Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. p. 263.</ref> Both innovations appeared around the same time and historians believe that people began comparing the chariot branlant and the Hungarian light coach.  However, the earliest illustrations of the Hungarian 'Kochi-wagon' do not indicate any suspension, and often the use of three horses in harness.\n\nUnder King [[Mathias Corvinus]] (1458\u201390), who enjoyed fast travel, the Hungarians developed fast road transport, and the town of [[Kocs]] between [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] became an important post-town, and gave its name to the new vehicle type.<ref>{{Cite OED 1933|Coach}}</ref> The Hungarian [[Coach (carriage)|coach]] was highly praised because it was capable of holding 8 men, used light wheels, could be towed by only one horse (it may have been suspended by leather straps, but this is a topic of debate).<ref name=\"Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264\">Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.</ref> Ultimately it was the Hungarian coach that generated a greater buzz of conversation than the chariot branlant of France because it was a much smoother ride.<ref name=\"Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264\"/> Henceforth, the Hungarian coach spread across Europe rather quickly, in part due to [[Ippolito d'Este of Ferrara]] (1479\u20131529), nephew of Mathias' queen [[Beatrix of Aragon]], who as a very junior Archbishopric of [[Esztergom]] developed a liking of Hungarian riding and took his carriage and driver back to Italy.<ref>{{Citation| last =Munby | first =Julian | contribution =From Carriage to Coach: What Happened? | year = 2008| title =The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel| editor-last1 =Bork| editor-first1 =Robert|editor-last2=Kahn| editor-first2 =Andrea| volume =| page =51| place = | publisher =Ashgate| id = }}</ref> Around 1550 the 'coach' made its appearance throughout the major cities of Europe, and the new word entered the vocabulary of all their languages.<ref>Etymology for ''Coach'' in ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press, 1989.</ref> However, the new 'coach' seems to have been a concept (fast road travel for men) as much as any particular type of vehicle, and there is no obvious change that accompanied the innovation.  As it moved throughout Europe in the late 16th century, the coach's body structure was ultimately changed, from a round-top to the 'four-poster' carriages that became standard by c.1600.<ref name=\"Munby\" />\n\n===Later development of the coach===\n[[File:James Pollard - The London-Faringdon Coach passing Buckland House, Berkshire - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The London-Farringdon coach, 1835]]\nThe coach had doors in the side, with an iron step protected by leather that became the \"boot\" in which servants might ride.  The driver sat on a seat at the front, and the most important occupant sat in the back facing forwards.  The earliest coaches can be seen at Veste Coburg, Lisbon, and the Moscow Kremlin, and they become a commonplace in European art.  It was not until the 17th century that further innovations with steel springs and glazing took place, and only in the 18th century, with better road surfaces, was there a major innovation with the introduction of the steel [[Spring (device)|C-spring]].<ref>Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'.' Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.</ref>\n\nIt was not until the 18th century that steering systems were truly improved. [[Erasmus Darwin]] was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England.  Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage.  First, the front wheels were turned by a pivoting front axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road.  Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.\n\nA pivoting front axle changes a carriage's base from a rectangle to a triangle because the wheel on the inside of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as [[Ackermann steering]].  Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.\n\nCarriage use in North America came with the establishment of European settlers.  Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest.  Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south.  Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people.  As in Europe, chariots, coaches and/or carriages were a mark of status.  The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation.  As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons.  Upon the turn of the 18th century wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high.  Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed based on the number of wheels they had.  These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North.  Europe, however, still used carriage transportation far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.\n[[File:Naghs Jahan Horses.JPG|thumb|upright=1.14|Tourists horse-drawn taxis in [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]], Esfahan.]]\n\nCarriages and coaches began to disappear as use of steam propulsion began to generate more and more interest and research.  Steam power quickly won the battle against animal power as is evident by a newspaper article written in England in 1895 entitled \"Horseflesh vs. Steam\".<ref>Mechanical Road Carriages: Horseflesh V. Steam. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1823 (7 December 1895), pp.&nbsp;1434\u20131435. BMJ Publishing Group</ref>  The article highlights the death of the carriage as the means of transportation.\n\nNowadays, carriages are still used for day-to-day transport in the United States by some minority groups such as the [[Amish]]. They are also still used in the tourism as vehicles for [[sightseeing]] in cities such as [[Bruges]], Vienna, [[New Orleans]], and [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].\n\nThe most complete working collection of carriages can be seen at the [[Royal Mews]] in London where a large selection of vehicles is in regular use.  These are supported by a staff of liveried coachmen, footmen and [[postillion]]s.  The horses earn their keep by supporting the work of the Royal Household, particularly during ceremonial events.  Horses pulling a large carriage known as a \"covered brake\" collect the Yeoman of the Guard in their distinctive red uniforms from St James's Palace for Investitures at Buckingham Palace; High Commissioners or Ambassadors are driven to their audiences with The Queen in [[landau (carriage)|landaus]]; visiting heads of state are transported to and from official arrival ceremonies and members of the Royal Family are driven in Royal Mews coaches during Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle and carriage processions at the beginning of each day of Royal Ascot.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Body===\n[[File:Elizabethboweslyonandkinggeorgeincanada.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|right|[[George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] in a landau with footmen and a postillion, riding on the near wheel horse, controlling both teams of horses. Canada, 1939]]\nCarriages may be enclosed or open, depending on the type.<ref>{{cite web | title=Horse Carriage Parts Horse Drawn Vehicle | url=http://www.liveryone.net/parts.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=30 October 2003 | accessdate=30 January 2008}}</ref> The top cover for the body of a carriage, called the ''head'' or ''hood'', is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a ''bellows top'' or ''[[calash]]''. A ''hoopstick'' forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a closed carriage, especially a diligence, was called an ''imperial''. A closed carriage may have side windows called ''quarter lights'' (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a \"glass coach\". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a ''[[dashboard]]'' intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a ''wing'' (British). A ''foot iron'' or ''footplate'' may serve as a carriage step.\n\nA carriage driver sits on a ''box'' or ''perch'', usually elevated and small. When at the front it is known as a ''dickey box'', a term also used for a seat at the back for servants. A [[footman]] might use a small platform at the rear called a ''footboard'' or a seat called a ''[[rumble seat|rumble]]'' behind the body. Some carriages have a moveable seat called a ''jump seat''. Some seats had an attached backrest called a ''lazyback''.\n\nThe shafts of a carriage were called ''limbers'' in English dialect. ''Lancewood'', a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A ''holdback'', consisting of an iron catch on the shaft with a looped strap, enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the ''yoke''. At the end of a [[trace (tack)|trace]], a loop called a ''cockeye'' attaches to the carriage.\n\nIn some carriage types the body is suspended from several leather straps called ''braces'' or ''thoroughbraces'', attached to or serving as springs.\n\n===Undercarriage===\nBeneath the carriage body is the ''undergear'' or ''undercarriage'' (or simply ''carriage''), consisting of the running gear and chassis.<ref>{{cite web | title=Basic Carriage Gear Horse Drawn Vehicles | url=http://www.liveryone.net/gear.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=2 November 2003 | accessdate=30 January 2008}}</ref> The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the ''running gear''. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle at the ends of a bar or beam called an ''axle'' or ''axletree''. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or ''forecarriage'', is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a [[dropped axle]], bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows for a low body with large wheels. A guard called a ''dirtboard'' keeps dirt from the axle arm.\n\nSeveral structural members form parts of the chassis supporting the carriage body. The fore axletree and the splinter bar above it (supporting the springs) are united by a piece of wood or metal called a [[futchel]], which forms a socket for the pole that extends from the front axle. For strength and support, a rod called the ''[[backstay]]'' may extend from either end of the rear axle to the reach, the pole or rod joining the hind axle to the forward bolster above the front axle.\n\nA skid called a ''drag'', ''[[dragshoe]]'', ''shoe'' or ''[[skidpan]]'' retards the motion of the wheels. A London patent of 1841 describes one such apparatus: \"An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle\". The original feature of this modification was that instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver's position) so that it is allowed  to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of \"pendant-levers\" and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position  and be ready for further use.<ref>Patent 9020, 7 July 1841, awarded to Thomas Fuller, a coach-builder of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]</ref>\n\nA catch or block called a ''trigger'' may be used to hold a wheel on an incline.\n\nA horizontal wheel or segment of a wheel called a ''[[fifth wheel]]'' sometimes forms an extended support to prevent the carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt or perchbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a ''headblock'' might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.\n\n=== Fittings ===\nMany of these fittings were carried over to [[horseless carriage]]s and evolved into the modern elements of automobiles. During the [[Brass Era car|Brass Era]] they were often the same parts on either type of carriage (i.e., horse-drawn or horseless). \n* Upholstery (trimming): traditionally similar to the [[upholstery]] of furniture; evolved into car interior ulholstery such as [[car seat]]s and door trim panels\n* Carriage lamps: typically [[oil lamp]]s for centuries, although [[carbide lamp]]s and battery-powered [[electric light|electric lamp]]s were also used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; evolved into car [[headlamp]]s\n* Trunk: a [[trunk (luggage)|luggage trunk]] serving the same purpose as, and which gave its name to, later [[trunk (car)|car trunks]]\n* [[Toolbox]]: a small box with enough [[hand tool]]s to make simple repairs on the roadside\n* [[Blanket]]s: in winter, blankets for the driver and passengers and often [[horse blanket]]s as well\n* [[Running board]]: a step to assist in climbing onto the carriage and also sometimes a place for [[standing passenger]]s\n* [[Shovel]]: useful for mud and snow in the roadway, to free the carriage from being stuck; was especially important in the era when most roads were [[dirt road]]s, often with deep [[rut (roads)|ruts]]\n* [[Whip#Buggy whip and coachwhip|Buggy whip or coachwhip]]: whips for the horses. For obvious reasons, this is one of the components of carriage equipment that did not carry over from horse-drawn carriages to horseless carriages, and that fact has made such whips one of the prototypical or stereotypical examples of products whose manufacture is subject to [[disruptive innovation]]\n\n==Carriage terminology==\n[[File:HansomCab.jpg|thumb|[[Hansom]] cab and driver adding character to period filming]]\n[[File:WeddingCarriage.JPG|thumb|[[Bride]] descending from a decorated wedding carriage]]\n[[File:Cartelajf.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Cartela (or \"Kartela\", a [[Philippine]] horse carriage, in art (8 Waves Waterpark & Hotel [http://www.8waveswaterpark.com.ph/][[San Rafael, Bulacan]]).]]\nA person whose business was to drive a carriage was a ''[[coachman]]''. A servant in livery called a ''[[footman]]'' or ''piquer'' formerly served in attendance upon a rider or was required to run before his master's carriage to clear the way. An attendant on horseback called an ''outrider'' often rode ahead of or next to a carriage. A ''carriage starter'' directed the flow of vehicles taking on passengers at the curbside. A ''hackneyman'' hired out horses and carriages. When hawking wares, a ''hawker'' was often assisted by a carriage.\n\nUpper-class people of wealth and social position, those wealthy enough to keep carriages, were referred to as ''carriage folk'' or ''carriage trade''.\n\nCarriage passengers often used a ''lap robe'' as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet. A ''buffalo robe'', made from the hide of an [[American bison]] dressed with the hair on, was sometimes used as a carriage robe; it was commonly trimmed to rectangular shape and lined on the skin side with fabric. A ''carriage boot'', fur-trimmed for winter wear, was made usually of fabric with a fur or felt lining. A ''knee boot'' protected the knees from rain or splatter.\n\nA horse especially bred for carriage use by appearance and stylish action is called a ''carriage horse''; one for use on a road is a ''road horse''. One such breed is the ''[[Cleveland Bay]]'', uniformly [[Bay (horse)|bay]] in color, of good conformation and strong constitution. Horses were broken in using a bodiless carriage frame called a ''break'' or ''brake''.\n\nA ''[[carriage dog]]'' or ''coach dog'' is bred for running beside a carriage.\n\nA roofed structure that extends from the entrance of a building over an adjacent driveway and that shelters callers as they get in or out of their vehicles is known as a ''carriage porch'' or ''[[porte cochere]]''. An outbuilding for a carriage is a ''coach house'', which was often combined with accommodation for a [[groom]] or other servants.\n\nA ''[[livery stable]]'' kept horses and usually carriages for hire. A range of stables, usually with ''[[carriage house]]s'' (''remises'') and living quarters built around a yard, court or street, is called a ''[[mews]]''.\n\nA kind of dynamometer called a ''peirameter'' indicates the power necessary to haul a carriage over a road or track.\n\n==Competitive driving==\n{{Main|Driving (horse)|Combined driving|Draft horse showing|Roadster (horse)}}\n[[File:Horse carriage at FEI European Dressage Championship 02.jpg|thumb|A horse carriage at European Dressage Championship]]\nIn most European and English-speaking countries, driving is a competitive equestrian sport. Many [[horse show]]s host driving competitions for a particular style of driving, breed of horse, or type of vehicle. Show vehicles are usually carriages, [[cart]]s, or [[horse and buggy|buggies]] and, occasionally, [[sulky|sulkies]] or [[wagon]]s. Modern high-technology carriages are made purely for competition by companies such as Bennington Carriages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bennington.co.uk |title=Bennington Carriages homepage}}</ref> in England.\nTerminology varies: the simple, lightweight two- or four-wheeled show vehicle common in many nations is called a \"cart\" in the USA, but a \"carriage\" in Australia.\n\nInternationally, there is intense competition in the all-round test of driving: [[combined driving]], also known as ''horse-driving trials'', an equestrian discipline regulated by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale]] (International Equestrian Federation) with national organizations representing each member country. World championships are conducted in alternate years, including single-horse, horse pairs and four-in-hand championships. The [[World Equestrian Games]], held at four-year intervals, also includes a four-in-hand competition.\n\nFor [[pony]] drivers, the World Combined Pony Championships are held every two years and include singles, pairs and four-in-hand events.\n\n==Types of horse-drawn carriages==\n[[File:Wien Stefansdom fiaker DSC02643.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.91|In Vienna, rental [[Landau (carriage)|landau]]s called ''[[Fiacre (carriage)|Fiacre]]s'' carry tourists around the old city.]]\n\nAn almost bewildering variety of horse-drawn carriages existed. Arthur Ingram's ''Horse Drawn Vehicles since 1760 in Colour'' lists 325 types with a short description of each. By the early 19th century one's choice of carriage was only in part based on practicality and performance; it was also a status statement and subject to changing fashions.

This novel is a [[mystery novel|mystery]] of the type known as a [[whodunnit]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nJames Vaughan and Hugh Prentice are the two junior partners of the law practice of Prentice, Prentice & Vaughan and its senior partner, Hugh's uncle Charles Prentice.  Hugh and his fianc\u00e9 Helen are in Hugh's office, which is littered with detective stories; a French-speaking [[Arab]] who calls himself Abu of Ispahan arrives and asks for an appointment to discuss a private matter.  Helen leaves, and Hugh must deliver a brief to famed defense lawyer Patrick Butler.  Since Abu wishes to deal with no one except \"Meester Pren-tees\", Hugh asks him to wait for forty-five minutes; before Hugh leaves, Abu announces \"All my troubles have been caused by your gloves.\"  Hugh goes down the hall to speak with James Vaughan.  When they hear a scream, both rush back to Hugh's office to find Abu stabbed; he has just enough time and breath to gasp \"Your gloves\" in French before he expires.

This novel is a [[mystery novel|mystery]] of the type known as a [[whodunnit]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nJames Vaughan and Hugh Prentice are the two junior partners of the law practice of Prentice, Prentice & Vaughan and its senior partner, Hugh's uncle Charles Prentice.  Hugh and his fiance Helen are in Hugh's office, which is littered with detective stories; a French-speaking [[Arab]] who calls himself Abu of Ispahan arrives and asks for an appointment to discuss a private matter.  Helen leaves, and Hugh must deliver a brief to famed defense lawyer Patrick Butler.  Since Abu wishes to deal with no one except \"Meester Pren-tees\", Hugh asks him to wait for forty-five minutes; before Hugh leaves, Abu announces \"All my troubles have been caused by your gloves.\"  Hugh goes down the hall to speak with James Vaughan.  When they hear a scream, both rush back to Hugh's office to find Abu stabbed; he has just enough time and breath to gasp \"Your gloves\" in French before he expires.  Hugh immediately enlists the help of Patrick Butler, who is accompanied by the upper-crust Lady Pamela de Saxe.  The three, with occasional assistance from Helen, embark upon a series of breakneck escapes from the police and Hugh's strait-laced uncle while they gather evidence (including the beautiful stage magician C\u00e9cile Feyoum, Abu's widow).  In the course of the evening, Hugh falls out of love with Helen and into love with Pam, and at the night's climax Patrick Butler calls everyone together and reveals the name of the murderer, and the meaning of the gloves.\n\n{{John Dickson Carr}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patrick Butler for the Defense}}\n[[Category:1956 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by John Dickson Carr]]\n\n\n{{1950s-mystery-novel-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot summary:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: fiance \u2192 fianc\u00e9", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Butler_for_the_Defense"}

He performed in the [[United Kingdom]] and internationally (including in [[Israel]], [[Singapore]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and other countries). He was a pioneer of one-to-one performance, in which an artist repeats and adapts a score for a performance for a single audience member, or audience-participant, and repeats the action serially across a run of several days. The process and outcomes in Howells' signature works were frequently modelled on activities associated with the service industries or the [[tertiary sector of the economy]], such as washing the audience-participant's hair or clothes, or giving an audience-member a bath, replicating in some ways the labour of a [[hairdresser]], [[laundry]] worker, or [[caregiver]]; or he appropriated and adapted intimate interpersonal experiences in carefully mediated situations, like talking around a script or score in a setting such as a [[Japanese rock garden]] in ''The Garden of Adrian'' (2009), or holding hands, listening to music, and [[spoons sex position|spooning]] in silence in ''Held'' (2008).\n\n==Life and work==\nHowells was born in 1962 in his grandmother's house in [[Bapchild]], [[Kent]] in the South of [[England]]. He was raised in nearby [[Sittingbourne]], and attended Minterne County Junior School and [[Borden Grammar School]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyd57BdUi8Ip] Workshop info page (2011).

After working as a jobbing [[actor]] and [[Theatre director|director]] in provincial productions of plays and [[pantomimes]], in 1990 Howells joined the [[Citizens Theatre]] Company in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] as an [[assistant director]] to [[Giles Havergal]] (one of the company's three pioneering directors, alongside [[Philip Prowse]] and the late [[Robert David MacDonald]]).<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/24/adrian-howells] Gardner, L.

The play toured to Glasgow, London and Manchester in 1993-94. Howells recalled that '''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' described it as a hymn to tastelessness.

He is famous for his ''[[sirventes]]''.\n\nAmong his preserved works are the ''[[sirventes]]'' ''D'un serventes faire'' and ''La Paz de Costanza''. Peire wrote the first encouraging the communes of northern Italy to resist German overlorship, which has been dated to as early as 1157.<ref name=\"Scaglione176\">Scaglione, 176.</ref> However, Peire incites the Lombard cities by harkening back to the fate of the baronage of [[Apulia]] who had resisted the Germans earlier:\n<blockquote>\n''Lombart, beus gardaz<br>\n''Que ja non siaz<br>\n''Pejer que compraz,<br>\n''Si ferm non estaz!<br>\n''De Pulla'us sovegna<br>\n''Dels valens baros<br>\n''Qu'il non an que pegna<br>\n''For de lor maisos;<br>\n''Gardaz non devegna<br>\n''Autretal de vos!<ref>Vigneras, 245.</ref> \n</blockquote>\nThis has led some to date it to 1194, when [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] conquered [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] or as late as 1225, when the city-states of northern Italy renewed the old [[Lombard League]] in opposition to Henry's son, [[Frederick I of Sicily]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nWriting in Lombardy in the Occitan tongue under the nominal sovereignty of the [[List of German monarchs|German monarch]], Peire took the opportunity to poke fun at the [[German language]], writing in a famously debated passage: \n<blockquote>\n''Granoglas resembla'' [''la gent d'Alemanha'']<br>\n''En dir''(''e''): Broder, guaz;<br>\n''Lairan, quant s'asembla<br>\n''Cum cans enrabjaz''.<ref name=\"Spitzer71\">Spitzer, 71.</ref><br><br>\nFrogs resemble [the people of Germany]<br>\nIn saying: ''Brother, watz!''<br>\nThe sound of which as much resembles<br>\nDogs barking.\n</blockquote>\nThe German word \"watz\" is said to be an [[interjection]] resembling the clinking of glasses and proposes a toast.<ref name=\"Spitzer71\"/>\n\nPeire also had ties to [[Sardinia]]. He dedicated his ''D'un serventes faire'' to a ''senhal Malgrat de toz'', which has been identified as [[Barisone II of Arborea]], who was crowned [[King of Sardinia]] at [[Pavia]] by the [[Emperor Frederick I]] in return for 4,000 silver marks from [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], but was later deposed.

Peire wrote the first encouraging the communes of northern Italy to resist German overlorship, which has been dated to as early as 1157.<ref name=\"Scaglione176\">Scaglione, 176.</ref> However, Peire incites the Lombard cities by harkening back to the fate of the baronage of [[Apulia]] who had resisted the Germans earlier:\n<blockquote>\n''Lombart, beus gardaz<br>\n''Que ja non siaz<br>\n''Pejer que compraz,<br>\n''Si ferm non estaz!<br>\n''De Pulla'us sovegna<br>\n''Dels valens baros<br>\n''Qu'il non an que pegna<br>\n''For de lor maisos;<br>\n''Gardaz non devegna<br>\n''Autretal de vos!<ref>Vigneras, 245.</ref> \n</blockquote>\nThis has led some to date it to 1194, when [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] conquered [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] or as late as 1225, when the city-states of northern Italy renewed the old [[Lombard League]] in opposition to Henry's son, [[Frederick I of Sicily]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nWriting in Lombardy in the Occitan tongue under the nominal sovereignty of the [[List of German monarchs|German monarch]], Peire took the opportunity to poke fun at the [[German language]], writing in a famously debated passage: \n<blockquote>\n''Granoglas resembla'' [''la gent d'Alemanha'']<br>\n''En dir''(''e''): Broder, guaz;<br>\n''Lairan, quant s'asembla<br>\n''Cum cans enrabjaz''.<ref name=\"Spitzer71\">Spitzer, 71.</ref><br><br>\nFrogs resemble [the people of Germany]<br>\nIn saying: ''Brother, watz!''<br>\nThe sound of which as much resembles<br>\nDogs barking.\n</blockquote>\nThe German word \"watz\" is said to be an [[interjection]] resembling the clinking of glasses and proposes a toast.<ref name=\"Spitzer71\"/>\n\nPeire also had ties to [[Sardinia]]. He dedicated his ''D'un serventes faire'' to a ''senhal Malgrat de toz'', which has been identified as [[Barisone II of Arborea]], who was crowned [[King of Sardinia]] at [[Pavia]] by the [[Emperor Frederick I]] in return for 4,000 silver marks from [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], but was later deposed. Peire later had contact with the cultured [[Judge of Cagliari]], [[William I of Cagliari|Salusio IV]].\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Scaglione, Aldo.

Continued refinement of the instrument also contributed to the increase in popularity, with instrument builders like [[Jean-Claude Condi]] and [[Annette Osann]] bringing innovation to the bow and body.\n\nIn 1990s, the nyckelharpa was recognised as one of the instruments available for study at the folk music department of the Royal College of Music in Stockholm ([[Kungliga Musikh\u00f6gskolan]]). It has also been a prominent part of several revival groups in the later part of the century, including the trio [[V\u00e4sen]], the more contemporary group [[Hedningarna]], the Finnish folk music group [[Hyperborea (Finnish folk music group)|Hyperborea]] and the Swedish folk music groups [[Dr\u00e5m]] and [[Nordman]].

This allows a wider range of motion for both arms. It also affects the tone and sound of the instrument. Some players may use a violin bracket to keep the nyckelharpa away from the body so that it can swing freely, causing it to sound more \"open\" as its resonance is not dampened.\n\n==Variants==\nThere are four common variants of the nyckelharpa still played today, differing in the number and arrangement of keys, number and arrangement of strings, and general body shape. The predominant type is the three-row so-called \"chromatic nyckelharpa\", with the melody strings tuned A1 - C1 - G, a drone C (from the highest to the lowest string) that is only touched occasionally, and 12 resonance strings (one for each step of the chromatic scale).\n\nThe resonance strings, or [[sympathetic strings]], which were added to the instrument during the 2nd half of the 16th century, are not bowed directly but resonate with the other strings.\n\nTraditional variants of the nyckelharpa used to have one or more [[Drone (music)|drone string]]s.
