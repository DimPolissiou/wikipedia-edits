Picture by Jan Goedeljee.]]\n'''Katwijk aan Zee''' (literally, ''Katwijk-upon-Sea'') is a [[seaside resort]] located on the North Sea at the mouth of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]]. It is situated in the municipality of [[Katwijk]] and the province of [[South Holland]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The Origin till the Golden age of the Netherlands===\nThe name \"Katwijk\" probably has its origins in the name of a Germanic tribe called the [[Chatti|Chatten]] (Chatti). The Dutch word \"''wijk''\" means \"area\", so the name probably meant something like \"the Chatti area\".\n\nIn Roman times, Katwijk was a place of strategic importance. It was located at the [[Roman Empire]]'s northern border, at the mouth of the Rhine river, which in Roman times was larger in this area than it is today. There was a good deal of traffic along the Rhine. Katwijk was also a jumping-off point for the voyage to Britain. Built during the reign of [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]] (41\u201354), the town's name was ''[[Lugudunum Batavorum|Lugudunum]]''. The town's name was later associated with the name of the city of Leiden, but this is now thought to be incorrect.\n\nAfter the Romans left the settlement was abandoned and the area largely depopulated, except for small, isolated groups of Frisians ekeing out a living along the changing coast. The area was Christianised by British and Irish missionaries around the 9th century.\n\nStarting around the 12th century the population began to grow. In 1231, the first reference to ''Catwijck'' appeared in the records. At this time Katwijk aan Zee was little more than a few wooden houses.\n\nA reference to a fish market on the beach appeared in the records around 150 years later. In 1388, the fish market was moved from [[Katwijk aan den Rijn]] to Katwijk aan Zee. Katwijk aan Zee and Katwijk aan den Rijn were part of the same [[heerlijkheid]] called \"Beide de Katwijken en 't Zand\" (or something similar). They have been administratively joined for centuries.\n\nIn 1520 a Roman ruin known as ''[[Brittenburg]]'' emerged from the shifting sands on the beach just south of the mouth of the Oude Rijn, much to everyone's astonishment. It became the subject of a number of prints and paintings. It was square in shape, each side measuring 75&nbsp;m, and the ruins stood about 3&nbsp;m high. Eventually it disappeared back under the shifting sands. Attempts have been made to find it again, but to no avail.\n[[File:ErfgoedLeiden LEI001015651 Bomschuit op het strand van Katwijk aan Zee.jpg|thumb|Ship at the beach of Katwijk, ca. 1900. Picture by Jan Goedeljee.]]\n\n===From the 17th Century until today===\n[[File:Katwijk 1865.png|thumb|left|Map of Katwijk at the river Rijn and Katwijk aan Zee, 1865.]]\nThe differences with neighbouring communities and the non-migratory nature of members of the old Katwijk families, Katwijk aan Zee continued its existence as a quiet, close-knit North Sea fishing village from the 16th century.\n\nAlthough fishing is not a major activity in the village today and many of the inhabitants are nowadays secular, the old traditions still survive in many ways. Most of the inhabitants are still very traditional, whether they are member of a Calvinist church or not.\n\nKatwijk aan Zee had its own unique dialect, called 'Katwijks' or 'Strand-Hollands' ('Kattuks' in dialect). This dialect is still spoken by a considerable number of people, therefore being one of the few active dialects of [[Hollandic]] still in active use. Yet, fewer youngsters learn to speak the dialect actively.\n\nOver the course of time the mouth of the Oude Rijn silted up. However, a [[canal lock|lock]]s was constructed at the mouth of the river in 1807 by engineer F. W. Conrad (d. 1808). After this the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] (here called the ''Uitwateringskanaal'') did not flow naturally into the sea, but was held back by a lock. When necessary, the lock can be opened to allow the river to flow out to sea. The shore and the entrance to the canal were also strengthened by [[dike (construction)|dikes]]\n\nDuring World War II, most of the buildings of Katwijk aan Zee were demolished by the Germans to make way for the [[Atlantic Wall]]. In the dunes south of Katwijk, many bunkers from [[World War II]] can still be found.\n\nSince the 20th century, Katwijk aan Zee is a popular seaside resorts and the village grew explosively. In 1980\u20131990, Katwijk aan den Rijn and Hoornes-Rijnsoever became incorporated. Recently, in 2006, the neighbouring communities Valkenburg and Rijnsburg were added, which made a larger municipality called 'Katwijk'.\n\n==The artist colony Katwijk School==\n[[File:Emil Neumann - Blick auf Katwijk.jpg|thumb|Emil Neumann (1884): ''Gezicht op Katwijk, Katwijk Museum''.]]\n\nThe first known picture was from the famous Haalem painter Jacob van Ruisdael,<ref>Jacob van Ruisdael (1628\u20131682) is known for his wide variety of the landscape painting.</ref> its title is ''The view of the tower of Katwijk''.<ref>Bernt, Walter (1980): Die Niederl\u00e4ndischen Maler und Zeichner des 17.

He was considered one of the best insect illustrators of his era and his art and insect collections were sold to an eager market in London.<ref name=Sorensen>Sorensen 2005</ref><ref name=Mallis>Mallis 1971</ref>  \n\n==Early life==\nBy his own recollection, Abbot was born on June 1, 1751 but parish records indicate his birthday on May 31. He was the eldest son of James Abbot, a successful attorney, and Ann (Clousinger) Abbot. He grew up in a fashionable London neighborhood and spent part of his time at his family's country house. He was tutored at home and showed an early interest in collecting and drawing. Abbot studied art with [[Jacob Bonneau]] and his first known entomological paintings were created in 1766. Abbot's technique improved rapidly and in a few years he was producing some of the best entomological illustrations of the eighteenth-century.<ref name=Wilkinson>Wilkinson 1984</ref> The Russian naturalist [[Andrey Avinoff]], an accomplished artist himself, described Abbot's work as \"among the masterpieces of entomological portraiture\".<ref>Quoted in Wilkinson 1984</ref>\n\nSometime after 1767, Bonneau used his connections to introduce his talented student to [[Dru Drury]], a wealthy naturalist and owner of one of the best insect collections in England. Drury gave Abbot access to his collection and introduced him to other prominent entomologists and naturalists in London. Drury and other members of the [[Royal Society]] recognized his talent as an illustrator and encouraged him to go to America to collect insects. Abbot was eager for the adventure and settled on Virginia as his destination. He made arrangements with [[Thomas Martyn (zoologist) |Thomas Martyn]] and [[John Francillon]], both naturalists and dealers in natural history collections, to purchase whatever specimens he might ship back to London.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\n==Virginia==\nAbbot set sail for [[Jamestown, Virginia |Jamestown]] in July 1773. On the voyage he befriended the Goodall family from Virginia and agreed to stay with them at their plantation in [[Hanover County]]. He started collecting insects immediately on arrival but his first few years were difficult. The diversity and number of insects in Virginia did not meet his expectations and two of his first three shipments back to London were lost at sea. In addition, politics in Virginia were becoming increasingly divisive as [[American Revolutionary War|revolution]] approached. Abbot considered returning to London and Drury encouraged him to travel to [[Surinam]]. Instead he decided to join members of the Goodall family and head down to Georgia where he hoped to avoid the upcoming war and find better opportunities for collecting specimens.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" /><ref name=Sterling>Sterling 1997</ref>\n\n[[File:Abbotv1tab01AA.jpg |right|thumb]]\n==Georgia==\nAbbot left Virginia in December 1775, travelling overland in harsh winter weather. When he arrived in Georgia, he again stayed with the Goodall family in a log cabin constructed about 100 miles south of Augusta. Although he had hoped to escape the war, hostilities broke out almost as soon as he had settled in Georgia. Abbot served with the [[Continental Army]] as a private in the [[3rd Georgia Regiment]]. As a veteran after the war he was granted 575 acres of land where he established a plantation.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" /><ref name=\"Sterling\" />\n\nAt some point, Abbot married Penelope Warren and they had one son, John Abbot Jr., in 1779. Abbot became a successful planter and lived with his family in a large and comfortable house in [[Burke County, Georgia |Burke County]]. He also continued his work as a naturalist, exploring the [[Ogeechee River |Ogeechee]] and [[Savannah River]] basins as well as the coastal area near the port of Savannah. His insect collections and watercolor illustrations were in great demand. In 1797, ''The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia... Collected from the Observations of Mr. John Abbot'' was edited by [[James Edward Smith]] and published in two volumes. It was the first major work on North American insects and contained 104 etchings of watercolors of species that Abbot had collected.<ref name=\"Sterling\" />\n\nAbbot had a change of fortune around 1795; his wife died and he had some sort of financial difficulties. The details are unknown but by 1806 he was living with his son in Savannah and teaching school to supplement his income. However, he continued his work as a naturalist with a new focus on birds. In the early 1790s he became interested in ornithology and completed more than 1,300 bird illustrations in his lifetime. He collaborated with ornithologist [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist) |Alexander Wilson]] and the two of them exchanged a good deal of data on birds.<ref name=\"Sterling\" />\n\nIn 1818 Abbot moved to [[Bulloch County, Georgia |Bulloch County]] where he continued to live and work for the rest of his life. as he grew older both his vision and hearing were impaired. His last known shipment of insects occurred in 1836. He died sometime in 1840 or early 1841.<ref>Calhoun 2013</ref>\n\n[[Image:AbbotV1Tab02A.jpg |left|thumb]]\n==Legacy==\nHe produced thousands of insect illustrations, as well as several sets of bird illustrations.  The majority are preserved in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London, the [[British Museum]] and Houghton Library at [[Harvard University]]. Other repositories of his drawings include [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of South Carolina]], [[Emory University]], and the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]]. Some have been dispersed following various auctions that included his drawings. The bird and insect specimens that he collected were sent to Britain and Europe, but a certain number were lost at sea, which discouraged him. He nonetheless continued to collect and paint specimens until at least 1835.\n\nThe only publication to bear his name was ''The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia'', whose primary author was [[James Edward Smith]].  It included 104 plates that were reproduced from original drawings by John Abbot, which are now preserved at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Abbot also provided most of the observations published in the book. First appearing in 1797, new copies of the book were issued for thirty years.\n\nFrom 1829 to 1837, renowned French entomologist [[Jean Baptiste Boisduval]] and wealthy American naturalist [[John Eatton Le Conte]] published installments of ''Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Iconographie des L\u00e9pidopt\u00e8res et des Chenilles de l'Am\u00e9rique Septentrionale''. This publication included 78 hand-colored engraved plates, most created from original drawings by John Abbot. The majority of these original drawings are now deposited at the [[University of South Carolina]].  A collection of 130 watercolors of birds, are held by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217274| title=John Abbot Collection, undated|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives}}</ref>\n\n\n\n==Works==\n*with [[James Edward Smith]], ''The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia Collected from Observations by John Abbot'' (1797) (2 volumes, 104 plates).\n*''Drawings of the Insects of Georgia, in America'' (1792\u20131804) (17 volumes, unpublished).\n*Original drawings for [[Jean Baptiste Alphonse Dechauffour de Boisduval]]'s and [[John Eatton Le Conte]]'s ''Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Iconographie des L\u00e9pidopt\u00e8res et des Chenilles de l'Am\u00e9rique septentrionale'' (1833).\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://images.peabody.yale.edu/lepsoc/jls/2000s/2004/2004-58(3)143-Calhoun.pdf Calhoun, J.

The band is notable for being one of the few [[Christian metal|Christian]] bands in its genre, and the fact that they are the most successful group on its label [[Bombworks Records]],<ref>Morrow, Matt, (January 18, 2006) [http://thewhippingpost.tripod.com/bombworksrecordsinterview.htm Bombworks Records interview],\"David: Without a question, ''Holy Blood'' has been our top seller. ''Waves Are Dancing'' has been the best seller, but ''The Wanderer'' has certainly been no slouch.\", ''The Whipping Post'', retrieved October 20, 2007.</ref> and the band has been noted worldwide despite being an underground group.<ref name=\"TWP_Wanderer\"/> Holy Blood has released six albums: ''[[The Wanderer (Holy Blood album)|The Wanderer]]'', ''[[Waves Are Dancing]]'', ''The Patriot'', ''Shining Sun'', ''[[Day of Vengeance (album)|Day of Vengeance]]'' and ''Voice of Blood''.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1999\u20132000)===\nHoly Blood was formed in October 1999 and their music leaned towards [[hardcore punk]] style. The band consisted of guitarist-vocalist Fedir Buzylevych, drummer Dmytro Tytorenko, and bassist Mykhailo Rodionov. Previously, they played in a band called Voice of Cryeth in which Buzylevych played bass, Tytorenko handled keyboard, and Rodionov was the guitarist.\n\nIn 2000, the band changed their style to [[deathgrind]]. A year later in 2001 the band was joined by former Revival lead guitarist Oleksiy Furman, female keyboardist Vira Kniazeva and former Maranatha member Yevhen Tsesarev replaced Radionov as a bassist. Rodionov became a rhythm guitarist. After the line up change, Holy Blood changed their style to [[melodic death metal]] and began to record the first studio album.\n\n===''The Wanderer'' (2001\u20132002)===\nFedir and Vira were married in August 2001. In 2002 a local small metal label called Core Zone released the first album ''[[The Wanderer (Holy Blood album)|The Wanderer]]''. In the middle 2002, the guitarist Oleksiy Furman left the band and was replaced by former Maranatha member Artem Stupak. Holy Blood changed their style to folk death-black metal style and Buzilevich incorporated [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].\n\nRodionov left the band in 2003 and was replaced by former Celestial Call member Serhiy Nahornyi. Artem Stupak focused on his own project, unblack metal duo Evroklidon, and eventually Buzylevych became the rhythm guitarist. Serhiy Nahorny became a lead guitarist. Buzlylevych and Rodionov recorded a death-grind studio project under the name ''Requital'' and released the album ''Retribution for Sin''. It included previously unreleased songs of Holy Blood.\n\nIn December 2003 bass-guitarist Yevhen Tsesarev left the band and was replaced by Oleksiy Andrushenko (Axxent). In the March 2004, Holy Blood was featured on a compilation of Ukrainian Christian metal bands called ''Total Armageddon''.\n\n===''Waves Are Dancing'' and ''The Patriot'' (2003\u20132008)===\nOn April 18, 2004, the band shot their first music video called \"The Spring\". During the same month the band launched its website and afterwards their popularity increased notably outside their native country,<ref name=\"TWP_Wanderer\">Morrow, Matt,[http://thewhippingpost.tripod.com/holybloodthewanderer/ Holy Blood \u2013 The Wanderer], The Whipping Post, retrieved (October 20, 2007)</ref> and started writing third album. later that year, Holy Blood caught the interest of [[Texas]]-based records label [[Bombworks Records]]. The band signed a record deal with the label which released \"The Wanderer\" to available in many different countries. In October band played concerts in Belarus and participated ''Hear My Call Tour''.\n\nIn 2005, Bombworks Records released Holy Blood's second album, ''[[Waves Are Dancing]]'', and it was also released by young Russian label called ''Musica Production''. On July 2, the keyboardist Vira Kniazeva left the band and was replaced by former Gefsad member Volodyslav Malytskyi. In October, the band was joined by Viacheslav Kirishyn who plays instruments such as bagpipe and flute.\n\nIn June 2006, Viacheslav has left the band. 2006 year was successful concert year for the band. Holy Blood played in different cities of Ukraine and also played in Moldova and notable foreign festivals such as ''Elements of Rock'' in Switzerland and ''Maata N\u00e4kyviss\u00e4'' in Finland. On December 1, Jmak Agency shot a professional music video for the self-titled song from the third album ''The Patriot'', released in early July 2008, and the Russian label Musica Production re-released the first album ''The Wanderer'' with new artwork.\n\n===''Shining Sun'' (2010\u20132012)===\nIn late 2008, the band went through major line-up changes: in a press release on their website, it was announced that all other members apart from Fedir Buzylevych left to continue under a different name, Oskord, while Fedir will continue under the Holy Blood moniker with new members, including his wife Vira, who was previously in Holy Blood from 2001 to 2005. With new members surrounding Fedir and Vira, Holy Blood completed fourth album, ''Shining Sun'', in early 2010. The band stated in a MySpace blog that the album features \"a combination of traditional Folk Metal with elements of Melodic Metalcore, and elements of new school Hardcore.\"<ref>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=262391549&blogId=532875487 Holy Blood-European Tour 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=February 7, 2009 }}.

Blood''' is a [[folk metal]] band from [[Kiev]], Ukraine, formed in 1999. The band is notable for being one of the few [[Christian metal|Christian]] bands in its genre, and the fact that they are the most successful group on its label [[Bombworks Records]],<ref>Morrow, Matt, (2006-01-18) [http://thewhippingpost.tripod.com/bombworksrecordsinterview.htm Bombworks Records interview],\"David: Without a question, ''Holy Blood'' has been our top seller. ''Waves Are Dancing'' has been the best seller, but ''The Wanderer'' has certainly been no slouch.\", ''The Whipping Post'', retrieved 2007-10-20.</ref> and the band has been noted worldwide despite being an underground group.<ref name=\"TWP_Wanderer\"/> Holy Blood has released six albums: ''[[The Wanderer (Holy Blood album)|The Wanderer]]'', ''[[Waves Are Dancing]]'', ''The Patriot'', ''Shining Sun'', ''[[Day of Vengeance (album)|Day of Vengeance]]'' and ''Voice of Blood''.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1999\u20132000)===\nHoly Blood was formed in October 1999 and their music leaned towards [[hardcore punk]] style. The band consisted of guitarist-vocalist Fedir Buzylevych, drummer Dmytro Tytorenko, and bassist Mykhailo Rodionov. Previously, they played in a band called Voice of Cryeth in which Buzylevych played bass, Tytorenko handled keyboard, and Rodionov was the guitarist.\n\nIn 2000, the band changed their style to [[deathgrind]]. A year later in 2001 the band was joined by former Revival lead guitarist Oleksiy Furman, female keyboardist Vira Kniazeva and former Maranatha member Yevhen Tsesarev replaced Radionov as a bassist. Rodionov became a rhythm guitarist. After the line up change, Holy Blood changed their style to [[melodic death metal]] and began to record the first studio album.\n\n===''The Wanderer'' (2001\u20132002)===\nFedir and Vira were married in August 2001. In 2002 a local small metal label called Core Zone released the first album ''[[The Wanderer (Holy Blood album)|The Wanderer]]''. In the middle 2002, the guitarist Oleksiy Furman left the band and was replaced by former Maranatha member Artem Stupak. Holy Blood changed their style to folk death-black metal style and Buzilevich incorporated [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].\n\nRodionov left the band in 2003 and was replaced by former Celestial Call member Serhiy Nahornyi. Artem Stupak focused on his own project, unblack metal duo Evroklidon, and eventually Buzylevych became the rhythm guitarist. Serhiy Nahorny became a lead guitarist. Buzlylevych and Rodionov recorded a death-grind studio project under the name ''Requital'' and released the album ''Retribution for Sin''. It included previously unreleased songs of Holy Blood.\n\nIn December 2003 bass-guitarist Yevhen Tsesarev left the band and was replaced by Oleksiy Andrushenko (Axxent). In the March 2004, Holy Blood was featured on a compilation of Ukrainian Christian metal bands called ''Total Armageddon''.\n\n===''Waves Are Dancing'' and ''The Patriot'' (2003\u20132008)===\nOn April 18, 2004, the band shot their first music video called \"The Spring\". During the same month the band launched its website and afterwards their popularity increased notably outside their native country,<ref name=\"TWP_Wanderer\">Morrow, Matt,[http://thewhippingpost.tripod.com/holybloodthewanderer/ Holy Blood \u2013 The Wanderer], The Whipping Post, retrieved (2007-10-20)</ref> and started writing third album. later that year, Holy Blood caught the interest of [[Texas]]-based records label [[Bombworks Records]]. The band signed a record deal with the label which released \"The Wanderer\" to available in many different countries. In October band played concerts in Belarus and participated ''Hear My Call Tour''.\n\nIn 2005, Bombworks Records released Holy Blood's second album, ''[[Waves Are Dancing]]'', and it was also released by young Russian label called ''Musica Production''. On July 2, the keyboardist Vira Kniazeva left the band and was replaced by former Gefsad member Volodyslav Malytskyi. In October, the band was joined by Viacheslav Kirishyn who plays instruments such as bagpipe and flute.\n\nIn June 2006, Viacheslav has left the band. 2006 year was successful concert year for the band. Holy Blood played in different cities of Ukraine and also played in Moldova and notable foreign festivals such as ''Elements of Rock'' in Switzerland and ''Maata N\u00e4kyviss\u00e4'' in Finland. On December 1, Jmak Agency shot a professional music video for the self-titled song from the third album ''The Patriot'', released in early July 2008, and the Russian label Musica Production re-released the first album ''The Wanderer'' with new artwork.\n\n===''Shining Sun'' (2010\u20132012)===\nIn late 2008, the band went through major line-up changes: in a press release on their website, it was announced that all other members apart from Fedir Buzylevych left to continue under a different name, Oskord, while Fedir will continue under the Holy Blood moniker with new members, including his wife Vira, who was previously in Holy Blood from 2001 to 2005. With new members surrounding Fedir and Vira, Holy Blood completed fourth album, ''Shining Sun'', in early 2010. The band stated in a MySpace blog that the album features \"a combination of traditional Folk Metal with elements of Melodic Metalcore, and elements of new school Hardcore.\"<ref>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=262391549&blogId=532875487 Holy Blood-European Tour 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=2009-02-07 }}.

The disappearance of the General Indian Court was one effect independence.  With political instability and economic stagnation following independence, indigenous communities largely maintained their land holdings, since large landed estates were not expanding to increase production.  \n\nFor nineteenth-century Mexican liberals, the continuing separateness of natives and indigenous villages from the Mexican nation was deemed \"The Indian Problem,\" and the breakup of communal landholding identified as the key to integrating of Indians into the Mexican nation.   When the Liberals came to power in 1855, they embarked on a major reform that included the expropriation and sale of corporate lands, that is, those held by indigenous communities and by the Roman Catholic Church. The [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]] first put in place the [[Lerdo Law]], calling for the end of corporate landholding and then incorporated that law into the Constitution of 1857. Ejidos were thus legally abolished, although many continued to survive.<ref>Van Young, \"Ejidos\", p. 471</ref>  Mexico was plunged into civil unrest, civil war, and a foreign invasion by the French, so not until the expulsion of the French in 1867 and the restoration of the Mexican republic under liberal control did land reform begin to take effect. Under liberal general [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], who came to power by coup in 1876, policies to promote political stability and economic prosperity, \"order and progress\", meant that large haciendas began expanding and many villages lost their lands leaving the peasantry landless.\n\n==Twentieth century==\nMany peasants participated in the Mexican Revolution, with the expectation that their village lands could be restored.  In particular, many peasants in the state of Morelos under the leadership of [[Emiliano Zapata]] waged war against the presidency of [[Francisco I. Madero]], a wealthy landowner whose  reformist political movement sought to oust the regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz; [[Victoriano Huerta]], the leader of a reactionary coup that ousted and assassinated Madero; and [[Venustiano Carranza]], a wealthy landowner who led the Constitutionalist faction, which defeated all others.  In 1917, a new Constitution was drafted, which included empowerment of the government to expropriate privately held resources.  Many peasants expected Article 27 of the Constitution to bring about the breakup of large haciendas and to return land to peasant communities.  Carranza was entirely resistant to the expropriation of haciendas, and in fact returned many to their owners that had been seized by revolutionaries.  \n\nDistribution of large amounts of land did not begin until [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] became president in 1934. The ''ejido'' system was introduced as an important component of the [[land reform in Mexico]]. Under C\u00e1rdenas, land reform was \"sweeping, rapid, and, in some respects\u00c0, structurally innovative...he promoted the collective ejido (hitherto a rare institution) in order to justify the expropriation of large commercial estates.\"<ref>Knight, Alan. \"Cardenismo: Juggernaut or Jalopy?\". [[Journal of Latin American Studies]], vol. 26. No. 1 (Feb. 1994, p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe typical procedure for the establishment of an ejido involved the following steps: \n# landless farmers who leased lands from wealthy landlords would petition the federal government for the creation of an ejido in their general area;\n#the federal government would consult with the landlord;\n#the land would be expropriated from the landlords if the government approved the ejido; and\n#an ejido would be established and the original petitioners would be designated as ''ejidatarios'' with certain cultivation/use rights.   \nEjidatarios do not actually own the land but are allowed to use their allotted parcels indefinitely as long as they do not fail to use the land for more than two years. They can pass their rights on to their children.\n\n==Criticism==\nOpponents of the ejido system pointed to widespread corruption within the ''[[Banco Nacional de Cr\u00e9dito Rural]]'' ([[Banrural]])\u2014the primary institution responsible for providing loans to ejiditarios\u2014illegal sales and transfers of ejido lands, ecological degradation, and low productivity as evidence of the system's failure, but defendants countered these arguments by pointing out that every administration since that of C\u00e1rdenas had been either indifferent or openly hostile to ejidos, that the land assigned to ejidos was often of lower quality and therefore inherently less productive than privately held land, that the majority of agricultural research and support was biased towards large-scale commercial enterprises, that the politicians complaining about Banrural were the people responsible for the corruption, and that, regardless of its productivity, subsistence production is an important survival strategy for many peasants.\n\n==Change==\nAs part of a larger program of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic restructuring that had already been weakening support for ejidal and other forms of [[small-scale agriculture]] and negotiation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in 1992 pushed legislation through [[Congress of the Union|Congress]] that modified article 27 of the Mexican Constitution to permit the privatization and the sale of ejidal land.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yetman|first=David |date=2000 |title=Ejidos, Land Sales, and Free Trade in Northwest Mexico: Will Globalization Affect the Commons? |url=https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/view/3109 |journal=American Studies |publisher=University of Kansas Libraries |volume=41 |issue=2/3 |pages=211\u2013234 |access-date=4 June 2011}}</ref> This was a direct cause of the [[Chiapas conflict]].\n\nThe changes to the ejidal system have largely failed to improve ejidal productivity, and have been implicated as significant contributing factors to worsening rural poverty, forced migration, and the conversion of Mexico, where the cultivation of maize originated, into a net-importer of maize and food in general.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bello |first=Walden |date=2009 |title=The Food Wars |url=https://archive.org/details/foodwars00wald/page/39 |location=New York, USA |publisher=Verso |pages=[https://archive.org/details/foodwars00wald/page/39 39\u201353] |isbn=978-1844673315 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chacra]]\n* [[Commons]]\n* [[Common land]]\n* [[Communal land]]\n* [[Chiapas conflict]]\n* [[M\u00e9xico Ind\u00edgena]]: controversial geography research project studying the future of the ''ejido'' and the ''comunidad agraria''\n* [[Usufruct]]\n* [[Well-field system]]: communal lands\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Appendini, Kirsten. \u201cEjido\u201d in ''The Encyclopedia of Mexico''.
