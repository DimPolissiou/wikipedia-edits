They kill him and poison his wife Kaveri ([[Srividya]]). However, she manages to escape. She gives birth to twins with the help of another woman named Muniyamma ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]), but the babies are separated, and each woman believes that the other is dead because of the events happening after the birth.\n\nOne of the twins, Raja (Kamal Haasan) grows up as a mechanic with Muniyamma, while the other twin, Appu (Kamal Haasan), a [[dwarfism|dwarf]],{{efn|Dwarfism occurs when an individual person or animal is short in stature resulting from a medical condition caused by abnormal (slow or delayed) growth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dwarfism.html |title=Dwarfism |publisher=nih.gov |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905190001/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dwarfism.html |archive-date=5 September 2015 |access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref>}} grows up in the [[circus]] with his mother.\n\nAppu falls in love with the daughter ([[Rupini]]) of the circus owner ([[T. S. B. K. Moulee]]), mistakenly thinking that she was asking him to elope with her, but she actually had asked him to be a witness to her marriage with her fianc\u00e9 ([[Anand (actor)|Anand]]), which was not approved by her father. Heartbroken over this and insecure about his height, he tries to commit suicide but is prevented by his mother, who then reveals the reason that his dwarfism might have been because of the poison force-fed to her when she was pregnant with the twins. This leads Appu to learn about his father's murder and decides to avenge him.\n\nMeanwhile, Raja falls in love with Janaki ([[Gouthami]]), who happens to be Satyamoorthy's daughter. As Raja resembles Sethupathi, Sathyamoorthy and his three friends gain interest in Raja.\n\nMeanwhile, Francis is fishing in a lake. Appu uses one of his well trained circus [[Indian Spitz]] puppies to lure Francis to an abandoned building, and reveals his identity to him. Francis smirks when he sees that Appu is a dwarf and cannot hurt him due to his size. However, Appu uses a [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldbergian contraption]] to kill him, and the dead body falls in a lorry covered with hay. Raja and Janaki have car trouble and hitchhike a ride in the same lorry, but they are oblivious to the dead body. The lorry driver ([[Kavithalaya Krishnan]]) discovers the body when he reaches his destination and calls the police. The inspector ([[Janagaraj]]) in charge of the case, suspects Raja by tracing the car number given by the lorry driver.\n\nAppu kills Nallasivam in a golf course using a [[tiger]] from his circus, but Nallasivam's caddy sees Appu's face, and the tigers tail from afar. This leads the inspector to Raja again, who, coincidentally, is wearing a tiger costume while performing a song at a festival in his street. Janaki becomes enraged when she learns that Raja has killed his father's friends and breaks up with him.\n\nRaja is released from custody as the postmortem examination has revealed real tiger wounds that could not be inflicted by Raja's costume. He goes over to Janaki's house to smooth things over with the inspector following him covertly. When he is talking to her, Appu tricks Sathyamoorthy into killing himself with a circus handgun that shoots backwards. Appu escapes, but Raja and Janaki enter Sathyamoorthy's room, hearing the gunshot a few moments before the inspector arrives. Janaki faints when she sees her father dead, and the inspector now believes that Raja shot Sathyamoorthy. Raja too escapes and is on the run, while the police had released a sketch of his face to the public. An exhausted Raja is spotted by some people in a market, and they try to catch him. Raja, in an attempt to evade capture, threatens to kill the nearest woman he gets hold of. When the crowd backs down, he releases the woman and escapes.\n\nThe woman, who incidentally happens to be Kaveri, realises that Raja is the other twin and seeks out Muniyamma. They both realise that the murders are committed by Appu, and Raja is mistaken as Appu, who overhears this. Dharmaraj believes that it is Raja avenging his father's death and that he is the next target, and decides to seek out Raja's mother, and is shocked to see Kaveri, whom he believed to be dead, also present there. Nonetheless, he kidnaps both women and threatens to kill them unless Raja surrenders to him. Appu escapes, helps Raja evade the police, and tells him everything. They both collaborate and go to the circus where their mothers are held captive. With the help of well-trained circus animals, Appu and Raja overpower the goons. With silent approval of his mother, Appu shoots Dharmaraj, who falls down and gets eaten by circus [[lions]]. Appu surrenders to the police, and Raja is set free and unites with Janaki.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Kamal Haasan]] as Sethupathy/Appadurai, Appu and Raja<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Srividya]] as Kaveri<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Rupini (actress)|Rupini]] as Mano<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Gautami]] as Janaki<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Janagaraj]] as Inspector<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] as Muniyamma<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Nagesh]] as Dharmaraj<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Delhi Ganesh]] as Francis Anbarasu<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Nallasivam<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Jaishankar]] as Satyamoorthy<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[T.

Appu comes to know that his father was an honest police officer who was killed by four criminals. The rest of the film shows how Appu succeeds in avenging the death of his father and how Raja proves his innocence as he is blamed for the murders committed by Appu.\n\nThe film was produced by Haasan and his brother Chandra Haasan under the production company [[Raaj Kamal Films International]]. The film's story was written by [[Panchu Arunachalam]], while Kamal Haasan and [[Crazy Mohan]] wrote screenplay and dialogues respectively. [[B. Lenin]] and [[V. T.

S. B. K. Moulee]]), mistakenly thinking that she was asking him to elope with her, but she actually had asked him to be a witness to her marriage with her fianc\u00e9 ([[Anand (actor)|Anand]]), which was not approved by her father. Heartbroken over this and insecure about his height, he tries to commit suicide but is prevented by his mother, who then reveals the reason that his dwarfism might have been because of the poison force-fed to her when she was pregnant with the twins. This leads Appu to learn about his father's murder and decides to avenge him.\n\nMeanwhile, Raja falls in love with Janaki ([[Gouthami]]), who happens to be Satyamoorthy's daughter. As Raja resembles Sethupathi, Sathyamoorthy and his three friends gain interest in Raja.\n\nMeanwhile, Francis is fishing in a lake. Appu uses one of his well trained circus [[Indian Spitz]] puppies to lure Francis to an abandoned building, and reveals his identity to him. Francis smirks when he sees that Appu is a dwarf and cannot hurt him due to his size. However, Appu uses a [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldbergian contraption]] to kill him, and the dead body falls in a lorry covered with hay. Raja and Janaki have car trouble and hitchhike a ride in the same lorry, but they are oblivious to the dead body. The lorry driver ([[Kavithalaya Krishnan]]) discovers the body when he reaches his destination and calls the police. The inspector ([[Janagaraj]]) in charge of the case, suspects Raja by tracing the car number given by the lorry driver.\n\nAppu kills Nallasivam in a golf course using a [[tiger]] from his circus, but Nallasivam's caddy sees Appu's face, and the tigers tail from afar. This leads the inspector to Raja again, who, coincidentally, is wearing a tiger costume while performing a song at a festival in his street. Janaki becomes enraged when she learns that Raja has killed his father's friends and breaks up with him.\n\nRaja is released from custody as the postmortem examination has revealed real tiger wounds that could not be inflicted by Raja's costume. He goes over to Janaki's house to smooth things over with the inspector following him covertly. When he is talking to her, Appu tricks Sathyamoorthy into killing himself with a circus handgun that shoots backwards. Appu escapes, but Raja and Janaki enter Sathyamoorthy's room, hearing the gunshot a few moments before the inspector arrives. Janaki faints when she sees her father dead, and the inspector now believes that Raja shot Sathyamoorthy. Raja too escapes and is on the run, while the police had released a sketch of his face to the public. An exhausted Raja is spotted by some people in a market, and they try to catch him. Raja, in an attempt to evade capture, threatens to kill the nearest woman he gets hold of. When the crowd backs down, he releases the woman and escapes.\n\nThe woman, who incidentally happens to be Kaveri, realises that Raja is the other twin and seeks out Muniyamma. They both realise that the murders are committed by Appu, and Raja is mistaken as Appu, who overhears this. Dharmaraj believes that it is Raja avenging his father's death and that he is the next target, and decides to seek out Raja's mother, and is shocked to see Kaveri, whom he believed to be dead, also present there. Nonetheless, he kidnaps both women and threatens to kill them unless Raja surrenders to him. Appu escapes, helps Raja evade the police, and tells him everything. They both collaborate and go to the circus where their mothers are held captive. With the help of well-trained circus animals, Appu and Raja overpower the goons. With silent approval of his mother, Appu shoots Dharmaraj, who falls down and gets eaten by circus [[lions]]. Appu surrenders to the police, and Raja is set free and unites with Janaki.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Kamal Haasan]] as Sethupathy/Appadurai, Appu and Raja<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Srividya]] as Kaveri<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Rupini (actress)|Rupini]] as Mano<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Gautami]] as Janaki<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Janagaraj]] as Inspector<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] as Muniyamma<ref name=\"hindutamil\" />\n*[[Nagesh]] as Dharmaraj<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Delhi Ganesh]] as Francis Anbarasu<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Nallasivam<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[Jaishankar]] as Satyamoorthy<ref name=\"cast\" />\n*[[T.

Ford contended that the loans were legitimate business transactions used to extend loans to him and his family funeral home business.\n\nA first trial in Memphis in 1990 ended in a mistrial with the [[hung jury|jury deadlocked]] 8-4 along straight racial lines.

He ordered that the jury for the retrial be selected for a pool of jurors living 80 miles from Memphis in 17 heavily Republican and predominantly white [[rural]] counties. The jurors were to be bused into Memphis for the trial. Ford appealed this jury selection plan twice to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] on the ground that it violated his constitutional right to a jury of his peers; the appeals were denied twice. In 1993, Stuart Gerson, a hold-over [[George H. W.

One of its aims is to use images of ''popular'' (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or [[kitsch]]y elements of any culture, most often through the use of [[irony]].<ref name=\"ages\" /> It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques.

''Trente ans de Nouveau R\u00e9alisme, La Diff\u00e9rence'', 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nIn Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the \"new figurative\", which arose from the roots of the crisis of [[informalism]]. [[Eduardo Arroyo]] could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both [[mass media]] communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of \"pop\" art is Alfredo Alca\u00edn, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.\n\nAlso in the category of Spanish pop art is the \"Chronicle Team\" (''El Equipo Cr\u00f3nica''), which existed in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists [[Manolo Vald\u00e9s]] and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as \"pop\" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. [[Film]]maker [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] emerged from Madrid's \"La Movida\" subculture of the 1970s making low budget [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book ''Almodovar on Almodovar'', he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film \"Funny Face\" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.\n\n==Japan==\nIn Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent [[avant-garde]] scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by [[Harue Koga]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.<ref name=\"eskolahk\">{{cite book|last=Eskola|first=Jack|title=Harue Koga: David Bowie of the Early 20th Century Japanese Art Avant-garde|year=2015|publisher=Kindle, e-book}}</ref> The work of [[Yayoi Kusama]] contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2175/interview-yayoi-kusama |title=Yayoi Kusama interview \u2013 Yayoi Kusama exhibition |website=Timeout.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>[http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101110936/http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama|date=November 1, 2012}}</ref> In the mid-1960s, graphic designer [[Tadanori Yokoo]] became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from [[The Beatles]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2000/?id=205 |title=Tadanori Yokoo : ADC \u2022 Global Awards & Club |website=Adcglobal.org |date=1936-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref> Another leading pop artist at that time was [[Keiichi Tanaami]]. Iconic characters from Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] have also become symbols for pop art, such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Astro Boy]]. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and his [[superflat]] movement.\n\n==Italy==\nIn Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the \"Scuola di Piazza del Popolo\" in Rome, with pop artists such as [[Mario Schifano]], [[Franco Angeli]], [[Giosetta Fioroni]], [[Tano Festa]], [[Claudio Cintoli]], and some artworks by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Del Pezzo]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Valerio Adami]].\n\nItalian pop art originated in 1950s culture \u2013 the works of the artists [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]] to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958\u20131959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a ''non-representational genre'', despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary ''kitsch'', which turned out to be a \"gold mine\" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.\n\nThe novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside \"domestic walls\" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the \"new world\", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including [[Gianni Ruffi]], [[Roberto Barni]], [[Silvio Pasotti]], [[Umberto Bignardi]], and [[Claudio Cintoli]], who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of \"let me have fun\" \u00e0 la [[Aldo Palazzeschi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.modena.it/galleria/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2005/pop-art-italia-1958-1968-1 |title=Pop Art Italia 1958-1968 \u2014 Galleria Civica |website=Comune.modena.it |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\nIn [[Belgium]], pop art was represented to some extent by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' was left on the Moon during [[Apollo 15|one of the Apollo missions]], as well as by other notable pop artists.  Internationally recognized artists such as [[Marcel Broodthaers]] ('' 'vous \u00eates doll? \"''), [[Evelyne Axell]] and [[Panamarenko]] are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was [[George Segal]].  Another well-known artist, [[Roger Raveel]], mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings.  By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of some of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the [[Vietnam War]]'s increasingly gruesome character.  Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day. [[Evelyne Axell]] from [[Namur]] was a prolific pop-artist in the 1964-1972 period. [[Evelyne Axell|Axell]] was one of the first female pop artists, had been mentored by [[Magritte]] and her best-known painting is 'Ice Cream'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/philadelphia-museum-facebook-racy-painting-425321 |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art Wins Fight with Facebook over Racy Pop Art Painting  |website=artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2020-01-17}}</ref>.  Other notable works by [[Evelyne Axell|Axell]] can be found in key galleries internationally.\n\n==Netherlands==\nWhile there was no formal pop art movement in the [[Netherlands]], there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include [[Daan van Golden]], [[Gustave Asselbergs]], [[Jacques Frenken]], [[Jan Cremer]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], and [[Woody van Amen]]. They opposed the Dutch [[petit bourgeois]] mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include ''Sex O'Clock,'' by Woody van Amen, and ''Crucifix / Target'', by Jacques Frenken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/2701/ |title=Dutch Pop Art & The Sixties - Weg met de vertrutting! |website=8weekly.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Russia==\n[[Russia]] was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s, when Russia was a communist country and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was [[Soviet]]-themed and was referred to as ''[[Sots Art]]''. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power, and with it came a freedom to express. Pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] with his painting titled ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' in 1990. It might be argued that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.<ref>[http://www.canofart.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022802/http://www.canofart.com/|date=June 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Notable artists==\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*[[Billy Apple]]\n*[[Evelyne Axell]]\n*[[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]]\n*[[Derek Boshier]]\n*[[Pauline Boty]]\n*[[Patrick Caulfield]]\n*[[Allan D'Arcangelo]]\n*[[Jim Dine]]\n*[[Burhan Dogancay]]\n*[[Rosalyn Drexler]]\n*[[Robert Dowd (artist)|Robert Dowd]]\n*[[Ken Elias]]\n*[[Err\u00f3]]\n*[[Marisol Escobar]]\n*[[James Gill (artist)|James Gill]]\n*[[Bruce Gray (sculptor)]]\n*[[Red Grooms]]\n*[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]\n*[[Keith Haring]]\n*[[Jann Haworth]]\n*[[David Hockney]]\n*[[Dorothy Iannone]]\n*[[Robert Indiana]]\n*[[Jasper Johns]]\n*[[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]]\n*[[Alex Katz]]\n*[[Corita Kent]]\n*[[Konrad Klapheck]]\n*[[Kiki Kogelnik]]\n*[[Nicholas Krushenick]]\n*[[Yayoi Kusama]]\n*[[Gerald Laing]]\n*[[Roy Lichtenstein]]\n*[[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]]\n*[[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]\n*[[Peter Max]]\n*[[Marta Minujin]]\n*[[Takashi Murakami]]\n*[[Yoshitomo Nara]]\n*[[Claes Oldenburg]]\n*[[Julian Opie]]\n*[[Eduardo Paolozzi]]\n*[[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]]\n*[[Sigmar Polke]]\n*[[Hariton Pushwagner]]\n*[[Mel Ramos]]\n*[[Robert Rauschenberg]]\n*[[Larry Rivers]]\n*[[James Rizzi]]\n*[[James Rosenquist]]\n*[[Ed Chucha]]\n*[[Niki de Saint Phalle]]\n*[[Peter Saul]]\n*[[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]\n*[[Colin Self]]\n*[[Marjorie Strider]]\n*[[Aya Takano]]\n*[[Wayne Thiebaud]]\n*[[Joe Tilson]]\n*[[Andy Warhol]]\n*[[Idelle Weber]]\n*[[John Wesley (artist)|John Wesley]]\n*[[Tom Wesselmann]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*[[Art pop]]\n*[[Chicago Imagists]]\n*[[Ferus Gallery]]\n*[[Sidney Janis]]\n*[[Leo Castelli]]\n*[[Green Gallery]]\n*[[New Painting of Common Objects]]\n*[[Figuration Libre]] (art movement)\n*[[Lowbrow (art movement)]]\n*[[Nouveau r\u00e9alisme]]\n*[[Neo-pop]]\n*[[Op art]]\n*[[Plop art]]\n*[[Retro#Retro art|Retro art]]\n*[[Superflat]]\n*[[SoFlo Superflat]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Diggory, Terence (2013) ''Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets'' (Facts on File Library of American Literature). {{ISBN|978-1-4381-4066-7}}\n*Francis, Mark and Foster, Hal (2010) ''Pop''.

One of its aims is to use images of ''popular'' (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or [[kitsch]]y elements of any culture, most often through the use of [[irony]].<ref name=\"ages\" /> It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques.

Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of [[abstract expressionism]], as well as an expansion of those ideas.<ref name=\"iha\" /> Due to its utilization of [[found objects]] and images, it is similar to [[Dada]].

Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'', by [[Andy Warhol]]. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by [[Andy Warhol|Warhol's]] ''Campbell's Tomato Juice Box,'' 1964 (pictured).\n==Origins==\nThe origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain.<ref name=\"ages\" /> In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to [[Hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] composition and [[Representation (arts)|representational art]].

Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American [[popular culture|pop culture]] as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society.<ref name=\"high\" /> Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by [[American popular culture]] ''when viewed from afar''.<ref name=\"iha\" />  Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of [[Dadaism]].<ref name=\"iha\" /> While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture.<ref name=\"iha\" /> Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]].\n\n===Proto-pop===\n[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Charles Demuth]], ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold]]'' 1928,  collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]] ]]\nAlthough both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others in Europe like [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Man Ray]] predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American ''proto-pop'' origins which utilized \"as found\" cultural objects.<ref name=\"iha\">Piper, David.

''Trente ans de Nouveau R\u00e9alisme, La Diff\u00e9rence'', 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nIn Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the \"new figurative\", which arose from the roots of the crisis of [[informalism]]. [[Eduardo Arroyo]] could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both [[mass media]] communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of \"pop\" art is Alfredo Alca\u00edn, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.\n\nAlso in the category of Spanish pop art is the \"Chronicle Team\" (''El Equipo Cr\u00f3nica''), which existed in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists [[Manolo Vald\u00e9s]] and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as \"pop\" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. [[Film]]maker [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] emerged from Madrid's \"La Movida\" subculture of the 1970s making low budget [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book ''Almodovar on Almodovar'', he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film \"Funny Face\" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.\n\n==Japan==\nIn Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent [[avant-garde]] scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by [[Harue Koga]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.<ref name=\"eskolahk\">{{cite book|last=Eskola|first=Jack|title=Harue Koga: David Bowie of the Early 20th Century Japanese Art Avant-garde|year=2015|publisher=Kindle, e-book}}</ref> The work of [[Yayoi Kusama]] contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2175/interview-yayoi-kusama |title=Yayoi Kusama interview \u2013 Yayoi Kusama exhibition |website=Timeout.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>[http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101110936/http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama|date=November 1, 2012}}</ref> In the mid-1960s, graphic designer [[Tadanori Yokoo]] became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from [[The Beatles]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2000/?id=205 |title=Tadanori Yokoo : ADC \u2022 Global Awards & Club |website=Adcglobal.org |date=1936-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref> Another leading pop artist at that time was [[Keiichi Tanaami]]. Iconic characters from Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] have also become symbols for pop art, such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Astro Boy]]. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and his [[superflat]] movement.\n\n==Italy==\nIn Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the \"Scuola di Piazza del Popolo\" in Rome, with pop artists such as [[Mario Schifano]], [[Franco Angeli]], [[Giosetta Fioroni]], [[Tano Festa]], [[Claudio Cintoli]], and some artworks by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Del Pezzo]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Valerio Adami]].\n\nItalian pop art originated in 1950s culture \u2013 the works of the artists [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]] to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958\u20131959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a ''non-representational genre'', despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary ''kitsch'', which turned out to be a \"gold mine\" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.\n\nThe novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside \"domestic walls\" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the \"new world\", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including [[Gianni Ruffi]], [[Roberto Barni]], [[Silvio Pasotti]], [[Umberto Bignardi]], and [[Claudio Cintoli]], who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of \"let me have fun\" \u00e0 la [[Aldo Palazzeschi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.modena.it/galleria/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2005/pop-art-italia-1958-1968-1 |title=Pop Art Italia 1958-1968 \u2014 Galleria Civica |website=Comune.modena.it |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\nIn [[Belgium]], pop art was represented to some extent by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' was left on the Moon during [[Apollo 15|one of the Apollo missions]], as well as by other notable pop artists.  Internationally recognized artists such as [[Marcel Broodthaers]] ('' 'vous \u00eates doll? \"''), [[Evelyne Axell]] and [[Panamarenko]] are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was [[George Segal]].  Another well-known artist, [[Roger Raveel]], mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings.  By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of some of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the [[Vietnam War]]'s increasingly gruesome character.  Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day. [[Evelyne Axell]] from [[Namur]] was a prolific pop-artist in the 1964-1972 period. [[Evelyne Axell|Axell]] was one of the first female pop artists, had been mentored by [[Magritte]] and her best-known painting is 'Ice Cream'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/philadelphia-museum-facebook-racy-painting-425321 |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art Wins Fight with Facebook over Racy Pop Art Painting  |website=artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2020-01-17}}</ref>.  Other notable works by [[Evelyne Axell|Axell]] can be found in key galleries internationally.\n\n==Netherlands==\nWhile there was no formal pop art movement in the [[Netherlands]], there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include [[Daan van Golden]], [[Gustave Asselbergs]], [[Jacques Frenken]], [[Jan Cremer]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], and [[Woody van Amen]]. They opposed the Dutch [[petit bourgeois]] mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include ''Sex O'Clock,'' by Woody van Amen, and ''Crucifix / Target'', by Jacques Frenken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/2701/ |title=Dutch Pop Art & The Sixties - Weg met de vertrutting! |website=8weekly.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Russia==\n[[Russia]] was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s, when Russia was a communist country and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was [[Soviet]]-themed and was referred to as ''[[Sots Art]]''. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power, and with it came a freedom to express. Pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] with his painting titled ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' in 1990. It might be argued that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.<ref>[http://www.canofart.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022802/http://www.canofart.com/|date=June 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Notable artists==\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*[[Billy Apple]]\n*[[Evelyne Axell]]\n*[[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]]\n*[[Derek Boshier]]\n*[[Pauline Boty]]\n*[[Patrick Caulfield]]\n*[[Allan D'Arcangelo]]\n*[[Jim Dine]]\n*[[Burhan Dogancay]]\n*[[Rosalyn Drexler]]\n*[[Robert Dowd (artist)|Robert Dowd]]\n*[[Ken Elias]]\n*[[Err\u00f3]]\n*[[Marisol Escobar]]\n*[[James Gill (artist)|James Gill]]\n*[[Bruce Gray (sculptor)]]\n*[[Red Grooms]]\n*[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]\n*[[Keith Haring]]\n*[[Jann Haworth]]\n*[[David Hockney]]\n*[[Dorothy Iannone]]\n*[[Robert Indiana]]\n*[[Jasper Johns]]\n*[[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]]\n*[[Alex Katz]]\n*[[Corita Kent]]\n*[[Konrad Klapheck]]\n*[[Kiki Kogelnik]]\n*[[Nicholas Krushenick]]\n*[[Yayoi Kusama]]\n*[[Gerald Laing]]\n*[[Roy Lichtenstein]]\n*[[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]]\n*[[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]\n*[[Peter Max]]\n*[[Marta Minujin]]\n*[[Takashi Murakami]]\n*[[Yoshitomo Nara]]\n*[[Claes Oldenburg]]\n*[[Julian Opie]]\n*[[Eduardo Paolozzi]]\n*[[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]]\n*[[Sigmar Polke]]\n*[[Hariton Pushwagner]]\n*[[Mel Ramos]]\n*[[Robert Rauschenberg]]\n*[[Larry Rivers]]\n*[[James Rizzi]]\n*[[James Rosenquist]]\n*[[Ed Ruscha]]\n*[[Niki de Saint Phalle]]\n*[[Peter Saul]]\n*[[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]\n*[[Colin Self]]\n*[[Marjorie Strider]]\n*[[Aya Takano]]\n*[[Wayne Thiebaud]]\n*[[Joe Tilson]]\n*[[Andy Warhol]]\n*[[Idelle Weber]]\n*[[John Wesley (artist)|John Wesley]]\n*[[Tom Wesselmann]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*[[Art pop]]\n*[[Chicago Imagists]]\n*[[Ferus Gallery]]\n*[[Sidney Janis]]\n*[[Leo Castelli]]\n*[[Green Gallery]]\n*[[New Painting of Common Objects]]\n*[[Figuration Libre]] (art movement)\n*[[Lowbrow (art movement)]]\n*[[Nouveau r\u00e9alisme]]\n*[[Neo-pop]]\n*[[Op art]]\n*[[Plop art]]\n*[[Retro#Retro art|Retro art]]\n*[[Superflat]]\n*[[SoFlo Superflat]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Diggory, Terence (2013) ''Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets'' (Facts on File Library of American Literature). {{ISBN|978-1-4381-4066-7}}\n*Francis, Mark and Foster, Hal (2010) ''Pop''.
