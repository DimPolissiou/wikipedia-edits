The film, which also serves as a direct sequel to the [[The Shining (film)|film adaptation]] of ''The Shining'', directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], is set several decades after the events of the original and combines elements of the 1977 novel as well. ''Doctor Sleep'' is written, directed, and edited by [[Mike Flanagan (filmmaker)|Mike Flanagan]] and stars [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Danny Torrance]], a man with psychic abilities who struggles with childhood trauma. [[Rebecca Ferguson]], [[Kyliegh Curran]], and [[Cliff Curtis]] have supporting roles.<ref name=\"youtube2\">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzFZxB-8cw | title=Doctor Sleep - Final Trailer [HD] | work=[[YouTube]] | publisher=[[Warner Bros.

Pictures]] began developing a film adaptation shortly after ''Doctor Sleep'' was published in 2013. Writer-producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] wrote a script, but the studio did not secure a budget for the film until the box office success of its 2017 horror film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', also based on a novel by King. Flanagan was hired to rewrite Goldsman's script and direct the film. Flanagan said the film would try and reconcile the differences between ''The Shining'' novel and film. Filming began in September 2018 in Georgia, including [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and the surrounding area, and concluded in December 2018.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures released ''Doctor Sleep'' worldwide from October 31, 2019, and in the United States on November 8, 2019. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for its performances and atmosphere, but with some criticism for its lengthy runtime.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critics Say Doctor Sleep Runs Long, but Star Rebecca Ferguson Shines|url= https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/doctor-sleep-review-roundup |work=[[SyFy]]|author=James Comtois|date=October 30, 2019|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref> Having grossed $72 million worldwide, its performance at the box office was considered to be disappointing due to the success of King adaptations such as ''[[It Chapter Two]]'' and ''[[Pet Sematary (2019 film)|Pet Sematary]]'', earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web|title='Charlie's Angels', 'Dark Fate', 'Doctor Sleep'...

[[Dick Hallorann]], a benevolent spirit, explains that the ghosts feed on Danny's psychic ability, his \"shining\". Now that the hotel has been abandoned, the starving ghosts are pursuing Danny. Hallorann teaches him to lock them in imaginary \"boxes\" in his mind. Meanwhile, the True Knot, a cult of [[psychic vampire]]s<ref>{{cite web |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3592801/near-dark-horrors-original-winnebago-vampires/|first= Meagan |last= Navarro |title= Before 'Doctor Sleep,' We Traveled With Horror's Original Winnebago Vampires in 'Near Dark' |date= November 8, 2019 |accessdate= November 13, 2019}}</ref> led by Rose the Hat, extend their lifespans by consuming \"steam\", a psychic essence released as they torture and kill those who have the shining.\n\nIn 2011, Danny\u2014now \"Dan\"\u2014has become an [[alcoholic]] to suppress his shining. After stealing money from a single mother, following a one-night stand, he realizes he has [[Hitting rock bottom|hit rock bottom]]. He moves to a small New Hampshire town and befriends Billy Freeman, who finds him an apartment and becomes his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sponsor. Rehabilitating, Dan becomes a hospice orderly. He uses his shining to comfort dying patients, who nickname him \"Doctor Sleep\". He also begins receiving telepathic communications from Abra Stone, a young girl whose shining is even more powerful than his. Meanwhile, Rose and her lover, Crow Daddy, observe a teenager named Snakebite Andi who has the ability to psychically control individuals. They later recruit Andi into the True Knot after feeding her the steam of Violet, a young girl who the cult murdered at the start of the film.\n\nIn 2019, the True Knot are starving as the steam has become increasingly rare. They abduct a young boy, Bradley, and torture him to death for his steam. A teenage Abra senses the event, and her distress alerts both Dan and Rose. Rose sets her sights on Abra, planning to extract her steam. Realizing the danger, Abra visits Dan in person and tells him she can track the cult if she touches Bradley's baseball glove. Dan refuses to help, telling her to suppress her shining to stay safe. That night, Rose [[Astral projection|projects her consciousness]] across the country and infiltrates Abra's mind but finds that Abra has set an imaginary trap, which injures Rose. After cult member Grandpa Flick dies of starvation, Rose sends the remaining members after Abra.\n\nHallorann visits Dan a final time, telling him to protect Abra as Hallorann once protected him. Dan tells Billy about the True Knot. They travel to the murder scene and exhume Bradley's body to retrieve his glove. They recruit Abra's father, Dave, and have him guard Abra's body as she projects herself to a local campsite, luring the cult there. Dan and Billy shoot most of them dead, though a dying Andi compels Billy into suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Crow Daddy kills Dave and abducts Abra, drugging her to suppress her shining. Dan telepathically contacts Abra, who lets him possess her, and manipulates Crow into crashing his car, killing him and freeing Abra. While Dan and Abra reunite, Rose consumes the cult's remaining stockpile of steam, healing her wounds and vowing revenge. As a last resort, Dan brings Abra to the Overlook, believing it will be as dangerous for Rose as it is for them. He starts the hotel's boiler and explores the dormant building, \"awakening\" it with his shining. He revisits the rooms where his alcoholic father, Jack, influenced by the Overlook, attempted to murder him and Wendy. At the hotel bar, Dan is greeted by \"Lloyd\", a ghostly bartender who strongly resembles [[Jack Torrance]]. The apparition attempts to tempt Dan into drinking again, but Dan ultimately declines.\n\nRose arrives at the Overlook. Dan and Abra pull her consciousness into Dan's mind, which resembles the Overlook's endless hedge maze. Dan tries to trap her in an imaginary box but fails. Rose, attracted by Dan's shining, invites him to join the cult, but he refuses. When she overpowers him and begins consuming his steam, Dan opens the boxes, releasing the Overlook's hungry ghosts from his mind. Rose, being a psychic vampire, is vulnerable to direct attacks by the ghosts. They brutally kill her, consuming her steam and then possessing Dan. He and the ghosts pursue Abra to Room 237. She tells the hotel that Dan sabotaged the boiler. Dan, regaining momentary control, tells her to flee. Possessed, he rushes to the boiler room but regains control before the hotel can make him deactivate it. Flames engulf the room. In his last moment, Dan sees a vision of himself as a child being embraced by his mother, Wendy. Abra watches helplessly as the hotel burns down just as the authorities approach.\n\nSometime later, Abra talks to Dan's spirit\u2014they assure each other that they will both be okay, and Dan disappears. Abra's mother learns to adjust with her daughter's powers, especially in communicating with the spirit of her deceased husband. As her mother leaves the room, Abra notices the ghost of the rotting woman from the Overlook is in the bathroom and prepares to lock the ghost up just as Danny did.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Danny Torrance|Danny \"Dan\" Torrance]], an alcoholic man with psychic powers known as \"the shining\".

I had known that he was supportive [of the sequel] but retired.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/doctor-sleep-the-shining-cameo-danny-lloyd-1203388429/ | title=How 'Doctor Sleep' Filmmakers Pulled off That 'Shining' Cameo| date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the recast characters, Flanagan explained, \"We explored everything, and there were only really two options as I saw it: It was either going to be something that was performed, or something that was digital.

It felt disrespectful.\" Noting that any solution would be controversial, the director decided that the best approach \"was not to do impressions; it was to find actors who would remind us of those iconic performances, without ever tipping into parody... I just want to be able to tilt people's memories toward those original actors, but then let the characters be their own. I want to cast someone to play Dick Hallorann; I don't want to cast someone to play Scatman Crothers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shining-sequel-doctor-sleep-a-spooky-as-hell-tribute-to-stanley-kubrick-and-stephen-king|title=Inside \u2018The Shining\u2019 Sequel \u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019: A Spooky-as-Hell Tribute to Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King}}</ref> The idea of casting a Nicholson impersonator as Jack was also considered, as was casting a big-name actor associated with or reminiscent of Nicholson, such as [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] or [[Christian Slater]].

Rose sets her sights on Abra, planning to extract her steam. Realizing the danger, Abra visits Dan in person and tells him she can track the cult if she touches Bradley's baseball glove. Dan refuses to help, telling her to suppress her shining to stay safe. That night, Rose [[Astral projection|projects her consciousness]] across the country and infiltrates Abra's mind but finds that Abra has set an imaginary trap, which injures Rose. After cult member Grandpa Flick dies of starvation, Rose sends the remaining members after Abra.\n\nHallorann visits Dan a final time, telling him to protect Abra as Hallorann once protected him. Dan tells Billy about the True Knot. They travel to the murder scene and exhume Bradley's body to retrieve his glove. They recruit Abra's father, Dave, and have him guard Abra's body as she projects herself to a local campsite, luring the cult there. Dan and Billy shoot most of them dead, though a dying Andi compels Billy into suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Crow Daddy kills Dave and abducts Abra, drugging her to suppress her shining. Dan telepathically contacts Abra, who lets him possess her, and manipulates Crow into crashing his car, killing him and freeing Abra. While Dan and Abra reunite, Rose consumes the cult's remaining stockpile of steam, healing her wounds and vowing revenge. As a last resort, Dan brings Abra to the Overlook, believing it will be as dangerous for Rose as it is for them. He starts the hotel's boiler and explores the dormant building, \"awakening\" it with his shining. He revisits the rooms where his alcoholic father, Jack, influenced by the Overlook, attempted to murder him and Wendy. At the hotel bar, Dan is greeted by \"Lloyd\", a ghostly bartender who strongly resembles [[Jack Torrance]]. The apparition attempts to tempt Dan into drinking again, but Dan ultimately declines.\n\nRose arrives at the Overlook. Dan and Abra pull her consciousness into Dan's mind, which resembles the Overlook's endless hedge maze. Dan tries to trap her in an imaginary box but fails. Rose, attracted by Dan's shining, invites him to join the cult, but he refuses. When she overpowers him and begins consuming his steam, Dan opens the boxes, releasing the Overlook's hungry ghosts from his mind. Rose, being a psychic vampire, is vulnerable to direct attacks by the ghosts. They brutally kill her, consuming her steam and then possessing Dan. He and the ghosts pursue Abra to Room 237. She tells the hotel that Dan sabotaged the boiler. Dan, regaining momentary control, tells her to flee. Possessed, he rushes to the boiler room but regains control before the hotel can make him deactivate it. Flames engulf the room. In his last moment, Dan sees a vision of himself as a child being embraced by his mother, Wendy. Abra watches helplessly as the hotel burns down just as the authorities approach.\n\nSometime later, Abra talks to Dan's spirit\u2014they assure each other that they will both be okay, and Dan disappears. Abra's mother learns to adjust with her daughter's powers, especially in communicating with the spirit of her deceased husband. As her mother leaves the room, Abra notices the ghost of the rotting woman from the Overlook is in the bathroom and prepares to lock the ghost up just as Danny did.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Danny Torrance|Danny \"Dan\" Torrance]], an alcoholic man with psychic powers known as \"the shining\".

Violet McGraw portrays Violet, a child who is murdered at the start of the film by the True Knot cult and later fed to Snakebite Andi as part of her induction into the group, whilst [[Bethany Anne Lind]] portrays Violet\u2019s mother.

Lloyd had been retired from acting for roughly 38 years, and was direct-messaged on [[Twitter]] by Flanagan to appear in the film. Producer Trevor Macy said of Lloyd's involvement, \"[Lloyd] was excited to do [the cameo]. He hadn't acted since [the original]. He's a schoolteacher, and a very successful one at that, like making the world better. He came back for a day, and we were thrilled to have him.\" When pressed as to why the filmmakers did not extend the same offer to Jack Nicholson, Macy responded, \"With Jack, I knew that they approached him for ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'', and that he seems to be very serious about being retired. I had known that he was supportive [of the sequel] but retired.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/doctor-sleep-the-shining-cameo-danny-lloyd-1203388429/ | title=How 'Doctor Sleep' Filmmakers Pulled off That 'Shining' Cameo| date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the recast characters, Flanagan explained, \"We explored everything, and there were only really two options as I saw it: It was either going to be something that was performed, or something that was digital. And even if we had Nicholson come back, based on the rules of the hotel and how the ghosts appear with respect to their age, he'd be performing the part through a digital avatar.\" Flanagan said that de-aging and digital actors, while improving rapidly, were still inadequate. \"The idea of having a digital Danny Torrance riding a trike five minutes into the movie, that just seemed like we were making a video game at that point. It felt disrespectful.\" Noting that any solution would be controversial, the director decided that the best approach \"was not to do impressions; it was to find actors who would remind us of those iconic performances, without ever tipping into parody... I just want to be able to tilt people's memories toward those original actors, but then let the characters be their own. I want to cast someone to play Dick Hallorann; I don't want to cast someone to play Scatman Crothers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shining-sequel-doctor-sleep-a-spooky-as-hell-tribute-to-stanley-kubrick-and-stephen-king|title=Inside \u2018The Shining\u2019 Sequel \u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019: A Spooky-as-Hell Tribute to Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King}}</ref> The idea of casting a Nicholson impersonator as Jack was also considered, as was casting a big-name actor associated with or reminiscent of Nicholson, such as [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] or [[Christian Slater]].
