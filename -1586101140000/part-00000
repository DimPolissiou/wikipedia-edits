He then moved to [[AC Omonia|Omonia]] in [[Cyprus]] where he won the [[Double (association football)|double]]. Patsatzoglou also had spells with [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[PAS Giannina F.C.|PAS Giannina]]. Patsatzoglou has also been capped in no less than 45 occasions with [[Greece national football team|Greece]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early life and career===\nBorn and raised in [[Athens]] to a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]-[[Romani people|Gypsy]] family and of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] faith, Christos started playing football for his hometown's local youth team Aghia Eleousa and managed a place in Greece  U-17 national team. His talent was spotted by [[Skoda Xanthi]]'s scouts and he was transferred there in 1996. He played for their first team for 4 years, from [[1996\u201397 in Greek football|1996\u20131997]] to [[1999\u201300 in Greek football|1999\u20132000]] where he won the [[Greek football PSAP awards|Best Young Player]] award in his final season in Xanthi in 1999-2000.\n\n===Olympiacos===\nAlongside [[Giourkas Seitaridis]], Christos was considered to be one of Greece's top footballing talents and was pursued to be signed by the country's \"Big 3\"; Olympiacos F.C., AEK Athens F.C. and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]], though he chose to sign with Olympiacos Piraeus. He was a top consistent performer until he was devastatingly injured in 2003, at a derby game between [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. Just before he suffered the devastating injury, Christos was in the form of his life while playing for Olympiacos and Greece, as he was such a athletic and brick-wall solid defender at the back and very skillful and sharp going forward and was considered to be one of the top defenders of European football through his performances for Olympiacos while playing in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and without doubt the best defender in all of Greece through his performances for Olympiacos in the [[Greek Super League]] and [[Greek Football Cup]] and inevitably, he was being courted by [[Manchester United F.C.]] who Olympiakos declined a \u00a36m offer from them as Patsatzoglou after being watched by a scout who was sent to Greece from Old Trafford for a long time to watch his games was in [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s plans to rebuild his defensive lines but Olympiacos were not willing at all to give up their club's and country's star defender as he was so crucial to the success of Olympiacos and one of the pin-up boys of Greek football from the early 2000s and he remained at the Greek giants where down the track he copped a bad injury which kept him sidelined for a long while. He worked to recover from his injury for about two years, and made his comeback near the end of the [[2004\u201305 in Greek football|2004\u20132005 season]].\n\nHe stated that he was healthy again and that it was up to his coach, [[Trond Sollied]] to play him now. Sollied was not sure if Patsatzoglou could play again in such a competitive level, but he was willing to give him more chances in the [[2005\u201306 in Greek football|2005\u20132006]] season.\n\nDuring the season 2006/2007, Patsatzoglou suffered another knee injury, unrelated to his previous one, at the away [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Upon his return, he played a handful of games.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 in Greek football|2007\u201308]] season, Patsatzoglou scored the winning the goal in the [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Werder Bremen]]. The goal would lead to Olympiakos' first Champions League away win, finishing 1\u20133.\n\n===Omonia===\nOn 1 June 2009 it was announced that Patsatzoglou will play for his ex-coach [[Takis Lemonis]], this time though for [[Cypriot First Division|Cypriot]] club [[AC Omonia|Omonia]]. Patsatzoglou agreed to a 2-year deal earning \u20ac800,000. Patsatzoglou indicated he wants to leave in the summer transfer window and return to [[Greece]]. Being played out of position at centre-back has been cited as the reason for his desire to leave. Patsatzoglou only played six league matches due to his long term injury.\n\n===AEK Athens===\nOn 30 August 2010 Patsatzoglou agreed on terms with AEK Athens signing a 1-year deal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aek365.com/a-76626/%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%84%cf%83%ce%b1-%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%b1-%ce%b5%ce%bd%ce%b1-%cf%87%cf%81%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%bf.htm | title=\u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf! | date=30 August 2010 | publisher=AEK365 | trans-title=Patsatzoglou signs 1 year deal with AEK | accessdate=9 August 2018 }}</ref> Patsatzoglou was also rejoined with manager [[Dusan Bajevic]].

several national titles. He then moved to [[AC Omonia|Omonia]] in [[Cyprus]] where he won the [[Double (association football)|double]]. Patsatzoglou also had spells with [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[PAS Giannina F.C.|PAS Giannina]]. Patsatzoglou has also been capped in no less than 45 occasions with [[Greece national football team|Greece]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early life and career===\nBorn and raised in [[Athens]] to a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]-[[Romani people|Gypsy]] family and of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] faith, Christos started playing football for his hometown's local youth team Aghia Eleousa and managed a place in Greece  U-17 national team. His talent was spotted by [[Skoda Xanthi]]'s scouts and he was transferred there in 1996. He played for their first team for 4 years, from [[1996\u201397 in Greek football|1996\u20131997]] to [[1999\u201300 in Greek football|1999\u20132000]] where he won the [[Greek football PSAP awards|Best Young Player]] award in his final season in Xanthi in 1999-2000.\n\n===Olympiacos===\nAlongside [[Giourkas Seitaridis]], Christos was considered to be one of Greece's top footballing talents and was pursued to be signed by the country's \"Big 3\"; Olympiacos F.C., AEK Athens F.C. and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]], though he chose to sign with Olympiacos Piraeus. He was a top consistent performer until he was devastatingly injured in 2003, at a derby game between [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. Just before he suffered the devastating injury, Christos was in the form of his life while playing for Olympiacos and Greece, as he was such a athletic and brick-wall solid defender at the back and very skillful and sharp going forward and was considered to be one of the top defenders of European football through his performances for Olympiacos while playing in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and without doubt the best defender in all of Greece through his performances for Olympiacos in the [[Greek Super League]] and [[Greek Football Cup]] and inevitably, he was being courted by [[Manchester United F.C.]] who Olympiakos declined a \u00a36m offer from them as Patsatzoglou after being watched by a scout who was sent to Greece from Old Trafford for a long time to watch his games was in [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s plans to rebuild his defensive lines but Olympiacos were not willing at all to give up their club's and country's star defender as he was so crucial to the success of Olympiacos and one of the pin-up boys of Greek football from the early 2000s and he remained at the Greek giants where down the track he copped a bad injury which kept him sidelined for a long while. He worked to recover from his injury for about two years, and made his comeback near the end of the [[2004\u201305 in Greek football|2004\u20132005 season]].\n\nHe stated that he was healthy again and that it was up to his coach, [[Trond Sollied]] to play him now. Sollied was not sure if Patsatzoglou could play again in such a competitive level, but he was willing to give him more chances in the [[2005\u201306 in Greek football|2005\u20132006]] season.\n\nDuring the season 2006/2007, Patsatzoglou suffered another knee injury, unrelated to his previous one, at the away [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Upon his return, he played a handful of games.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 in Greek football|2007\u201308]] season, Patsatzoglou scored the winning the goal in the [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Werder Bremen]]. The goal would lead to Olympiakos' first Champions League away win, finishing 1\u20133.\n\n===Omonia===\nOn 1 June 2009 it was announced that Patsatzoglou will play for his ex-coach [[Takis Lemonis]], this time though for [[Cypriot First Division|Cypriot]] club [[AC Omonia|Omonia]]. Patsatzoglou agreed to a 2-year deal earning \u20ac800,000. Patsatzoglou indicated he wants to leave in the summer transfer window and return to [[Greece]]. Being played out of position at centre-back has been cited as the reason for his desire to leave. Patsatzoglou only played six league matches due to his long term injury.\n\n===AEK Athens===\nOn 30 August 2010 Patsatzoglou agreed on terms with AEK Athens signing a 1-year deal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aek365.com/a-76626/%cf%80%ce%b1%cf%84%cf%83%ce%b1-%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%b1-%ce%b5%ce%bd%ce%b1-%cf%87%cf%81%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%bf.htm | title=\u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf! | date=30 August 2010 | publisher=AEK365 | trans-title=Patsatzoglou signs 1 year deal with AEK | accessdate=9 August 2018 }}</ref> Patsatzoglou was also rejoined with manager [[Dusan Bajevic]].

He had also the best recommendations from [[Stelios Giannakopoulos]], whom opinion always counts in \u00abReebok Stadium\u00bb.
