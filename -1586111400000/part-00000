This has been done because the zoo, with its central location is very much a city zoo, wants to integrate with the urban landscape. At the same time it affords the elephants distant views of open parkland and ancient trees, which prevents them feeling too enclosured.\n\n===Africa===\nMost of the \"Africa\" ({{lang-da|Afrika}}) section is taken up by the \"Savanna\" ({{lang-da|Savannen}}) area. This is an open field with a visitor bridge above containing species such as [[white rhinoceros]]es, [[giraffe]]s, [[impala]]s, [[sable antelope]]s, [[ostrich]]es and [[plains zebra]]s. The [[hippopotamus]]es, which have their own separate enclosure, also has partial access to the Savanna. Other species in the Africa section are [[okapi]]s, [[Abyssinian ground hornbill]]s, [[Congo peafowl]], [[caracal]]s and [[meerkat]]s.\n\n===Tasmania===\nThe \"Tasmania\" ({{lang-da|Tasmanien}}) section is unique to Copenhagen Zoo. The section was started after the wedding of [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark]] and the Tasmanian native [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary Donaldson]] in 2004, where the Tasmanian government gifted four [[Tasmanian Devil]]s to the zoo. These were the first Tasmanian devils to live outside of Australia. The area has since been expanded with a combined area for [[red-necked wallabies]], [[Eastern Grey Kangaroo]]s and [[common wombat]]s. Parts of this area is also accessible by visitors, allowing kangaroos and people to cross paths.\n\n===South America===\nIn the \"South America\" ({{lang-da|Sydamerika}}) section, visitors can see species such as [[capybara]]s, [[guanaco]]s, [[greater rhea]]s, [[Patagonian mara]]s, [[southern screamer]]s and [[giant anteater]]s. They all have access to one common area, modeled after the South American pampas.\n\n===Tropical Zoo===\nThe \"Tropical Zoo\" ({{lang-da|Tropezoo}}) consists of a rainforest hall with one section for free-ranging birds, turtles and [[Linnaeus's two-toed sloth|two-toed sloths]] and another for tropical butterflies and [[West African crocodile]]s. In between the two is a section for reptiles, amphibians, fish and the rare [[Java mouse-deer]].\n\n===Children's Zoo===\nIn the Children's Zoo ({{lang-da|B\u00f8rnezoo}}), visitors can see farm animals and small domestic animals, such as [[llama]]s, [[goat]]s, [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s, [[horse]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[rabbit]]s.\n\n==Rare species==\n* For several years, Copenhagen Zoo was the only zoo outside Australia that had [[Tasmanian devil]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovery.com/animal_news/2009/05/diseaseplagued-tasmanian-devils-now-endangered.html|title=Disease-plagued Tasmanian devils now endangered|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=6 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122211056/http://blogs.discovery.com/animal_news/2009/05/diseaseplagued-tasmanian-devils-now-endangered.html|archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2014}}.

The scientific director at Copenhagen Zoo, Bengt Holst defended the culling, saying that the giraffes at the zoo bred very well, and where this was the case, giraffes had to be killed to ensure the best [[gene]]s were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year.  The death occurred despite offers from other animal institutions (EAZA member [[Yorkshire Wildlife Park]] (YWP) in the United Kingdom and [[Hoenderdael Park]] in The Netherlands) to take the giraffe.<ref name=BBCGiraffe>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26098935 |title=BBC News - 'Surplus' giraffe put down at Copenhagen Zoo |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}</ref>\n\nYWP released a statement that it had the capacity to accept a further giraffe into its [[bachelor herd]] in its state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012, and that contact had been made with Copenhagen Zoo but no reply had been received.

She said, \"This situation should not have occurred at all. It just shows that the zoo is in fact not the ethical institution that it wants to portray itself as being, because here you have a waste product - that being Marius. Here we have a zoo which thinks that putting this giraffe down instead of thinking of alternatives is the best option\".<ref name=BBCGiraffe/>\n\nImages of the carcass being cut up in front of children and then fed to the zoo's lion population were circulated by the [[Associated Press]]. The zoo spokesperson, Tobias Stenbaek Bro, has been quoted as saying that visitors, including children, were invited to watch as the giraffe was skinned and parts fed to the lions. \"I'm actually proud because I think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn't have had from watching a giraffe in a photo,\" Stenbaek Bro said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steed R. and Rising, M. |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/danish-zoo-kills-young-giraffe-stop-inbreeding |title=Danish zoo kills giraffe to prevent inbreeding |publisher=Bigstory.ap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/09/world/europe/denmark-zoo-giraffe/ |title=Danish zoo kills healthy giraffe, feeds body to lions |publisher=CNN.com |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2014, despite the backlash from the giraffe cull, the zoo euthanized four lions (two adults and two ten-month-old cubs).

This has been done because the zoo, with its central location is very much a city zoo, wants to integrate with the urban landscape. At the same time it affords the elephants distant views of open parkland and ancient trees, which prevents them feeling too enclosured.\n\n===Africa===\nMost of the \"Africa\" ({{lang-da|Afrika}}) section is taken up by the \"Savanna\" ({{lang-da|Savannen}}) area.

The [[hippopotamus]]es, which have their own separate enclosure, also has partial access to the Savanna.

The section was started after the wedding of [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark]] and the Tasmanian native [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary Donaldson]] in 2004, where the Tasmanian government gifted four [[Tasmanian Devil]]s to the zoo. These were the first Tasmanian devils to live outside of Australia. The area has since been expanded with a combined area for [[red-necked wallabies]], [[Eastern Grey Kangaroo]]s and [[common wombat]]s. Parts of this area is also accessible by visitors, allowing kangaroos and people to cross paths.\n\n===South America===\nIn the \"South America\" ({{lang-da|Sydamerika}}) section, visitors can see species such as [[capybara]]s, [[guanaco]]s, [[greater rhea]]s, [[Patagonian mara]]s, [[southern screamer]]s and [[giant anteater]]s. They all have access to one common area, modeled after the South American pampas.\n\n===Tropical Zoo===\nThe \"Tropical Zoo\" ({{lang-da|Tropezoo}}) consists of a rainforest hall with one section for free-ranging birds, turtles and [[Linnaeus's two-toed sloth|two-toed sloths]] and another for tropical butterflies and [[West African crocodile]]s. In between the two is a section for reptiles, amphibians, fish and the rare [[Java mouse-deer]].\n\n===Children's Zoo===\nIn the Children's Zoo ({{lang-da|B\u00f8rnezoo}}), visitors can see farm animals and small domestic animals, such as [[llama]]s, [[goat]]s, [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s, [[horse]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[rabbit]]s.\n\n==Rare species==\n* For several years, Copenhagen Zoo was the only zoo outside Australia that had [[Tasmanian devil]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovery.com/animal_news/2009/05/diseaseplagued-tasmanian-devils-now-endangered.html|title=Disease-plagued Tasmanian devils now endangered|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=6 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122211056/http://blogs.discovery.com/animal_news/2009/05/diseaseplagued-tasmanian-devils-now-endangered.html|archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2014}}.

The scientific director at Copenhagen Zoo, Bengt Holst defended the culling, saying that the giraffes at the zoo bred very well, and where this was the case, giraffes had to be killed to ensure the best [[gene]]s were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year.  The death occurred despite offers from other animal institutions (EAZA member [[Yorkshire Wildlife Park]] (YWP) in the United Kingdom and [[Hoenderdael Park]] in The Netherlands) to take the giraffe.<ref name=BBCGiraffe>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26098935 |title=BBC News - 'Surplus' giraffe put down at Copenhagen Zoo |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}</ref>\n\nYWP released a statement that it had the capacity to accept a further giraffe into its [[bachelor herd]] in its state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012, and that contact had been made with Copenhagen Zoo but no reply had been received.

She said, \"This situation should not have occurred at all.

The zoo spokesperson, Tobias Stenbaek Bro, has been quoted as saying that visitors, including children, were invited to watch as the giraffe was skinned and parts fed to the lions. \"I'm actually proud because I think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn't have had from watching a giraffe in a photo,\" Stenbaek Bro said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steed R. and Rising, M. |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/danish-zoo-kills-young-giraffe-stop-inbreeding |title=Danish zoo kills giraffe to prevent inbreeding |publisher=Bigstory.ap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/09/world/europe/denmark-zoo-giraffe/ |title=Danish zoo kills healthy giraffe, feeds body to lions |publisher=CNN.com |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2014, despite the backlash from the giraffe cull, the zoo euthanized four lions (two adults and two ten-month-old cubs).

There has been a Jewish presence in France since at least the [[early Middle Ages]]. France was a center of Jewish learning in the [[Middle Ages]], but [[persecution of Jews|persecution]] increased as the Middle Ages wore on, including multiple expulsions and returns. During the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century, France was the first country in Europe to [[Jewish emancipation|emancipate its Jewish]] population. [[Antisemitism]] has occurred in cycles, reaching a high level in the 1890s, as shown in the [[Dreyfus affair]], and in the 1940s, under the Nazi German occupation and the [[Vichy regime]].\n\nBefore 1919, the Jewish population was largely based in Paris; many were very proud to be fully assimilated into French culture, and comprised an upscale subgroup. But a more traditional Judaism was based in Alsace-Lorraine, which was taken by Germany in 1871 and recovered by France in 1918 following World War I. In addition, numerous Jewish refugees and immigrants came from Russia and eastern and central Europe in the early 20th century, changing the character of French Judaism in the 1920s and 1930s. They were much less interested in full assimilation into French culture. Some supported such new causes as [[Zionism]], the [[Popular Front]] and Communism (the latter two were popular among the French political left).\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Vichy government collaborated with [[Nazi occupation of France|Nazi occupiers]] to deport numerous French and foreign Jewish refugees to [[concentration camp]]s.<ref name=USHMM/> By the war's end, 25% of the French Jewish population had been lost to the [[Holocaust]], but this was a lower proportion killed than in most other countries under Nazi occupation.<ref name=\"bseditions.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedie.bseditions.fr/article.php?pArticleId=158&pChapitreId=23982&pArticleLib=Le+Bilan+de+la+Shoah+en+France+%5BLe+r%E9gime+de+Vichy%5D|title=Le Bilan de la Shoah en France [Le r\u00e9gime de Vichy]|work=bseditions.fr}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">[[Yad Vashem]] [http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/yv/en/education/languages/dutch/pdf/article_croes.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, France has the largest [[Jewish population by country|Jewish population]] in Europe and the third-largest Jewish population in the world (after [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]). The [[religion in France|Jewish community in France]] is estimated to be 480,000\u2013550,000, but depends on the [[Who is a Jew?|adopted definition]]. French Jewish communities are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of [[Paris]], which has the largest population; [[Marseille]], with the second-largest population of 70,000; [[Lyon]], [[Nice]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Toulouse]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe majority of French Jews in the 21st century are [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] [[Maghrebi Jews|North African Jews]], many of whom (or their parents) emigrated since the late 20th century from former French colonies of [[French North Africa|North Africa]] after those countries became independent. They migrated to France beginning in the late 20th century. They span a range of religious affiliations, from the ultra-Orthodox [[Haredi]] communities to the large segment of Jews who are entirely [[Secular Jew|secular]] and who commonly marry outside the Jewish community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioscope.com/notes/2002/111_juifs_france.htm|publisher=Religioscope|title=France : Un portrait de la population juive}}</ref>\n\nApproximately 200,000 [[French Jews in Israel|French Jews live in Israel]].

From 163 B.C.E. there is evidence of Jews in Rome [...]. In the year 6 C.E. there were Jews at [[Vienne, France|Vienne]] and [[Gallia Celtica]]; in the year 39 at [[Lugdunum]] (i.e. [[Lyon]])\".<ref name=\"1906enc\"/>\n\nAn early account praised [[Hilary of Poitiers]] (died 366) for having fled from the Jewish society. The emperors [[Theodosius II]] and [[Valentinian III]] sent a decree to Amatius, prefect of [[Gaul]] (9 July 425), that prohibited Jews and pagans from practising law or holding public offices (''militandi''). This was to prevent Christians being subject to them and possibly incited to change their faith. At the funeral of [[Hilary, Bishop of Arles]], in 449, Jews and Christians mingled in crowds and wept; the former were said to have sung psalms in Hebrew. From the year 465 the Church acknowledged the Jews.<!-- meaning? --><ref name=\"1906enc\"/>\n\nIn the sixth century, Jews were documented in Marseilles, [[Arles]], [[Uz\u00e8s]], [[Narbonne]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], Paris, and [[Bordeaux]]. These places were generally centers of Roman administration, and located on the great commercial routes. The Jews built [[synagogues]] in these centers. In harmony with the [[Theodosian code]], and according to an edict of 331 by the emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], the Jews were organized for religious purposes as they were in the Roman empire. They appear to have had priests ([[rabbis]] or [[\u1e25azzanim]]), archisynagogues, patersynagogues, and other synagogue officials. The Jews worked principally as merchants, as they were prohibited from owning land; they also served as tax-collectors, sailors, and physicians.<ref name=\"1906enc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6262-france|title=France|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>\n\nThey probably remained under Roman law until the triumph of Christianity, with the status established by [[Caracalla]], on a footing of equality with their fellow citizens. Their association with fellow citizens was generally amicable, even after the establishment of Christianity in Gaul. The Christian clergy participated in some Jewish feasts; intermarriage between Jews and Christians sometimes occurred; and the Jews made proselytes. Worried about Christians adopting Jewish religious customs, the third [[Third Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Council of Orl\u00e9ans]] (539) warned the faithful against Jewish \"superstitions\", and ordered them to abstain from traveling on Sunday and from adorning their persons or dwellings on that day.

No mention of the Jews was found from his reign to that of [[Pepin the Short]]. But in [[Southern France]], then known as [[Septimania]] and a dependency of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kings of Spain, the Jews continued to dwell and to prosper. From this epoch (689) dates the earliest known Jewish inscription relating to France, that of Narbonne. The Jews of Narbonne, chiefly merchants, were popular among the people, who often rebelled against the Visigothic kings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hosang|first=F. J.

He allowed Jews to enter into lawsuits with [[Christianity|Christians]]. They were not allowed to require Christians to work on Sunday. Jews were not allowed to trade in [[currency]], [[wine]], or grain. Legally, Jews belonged to the emperor, and could be tried only by him.  But the numerous provincial councils which met during Charlemagne's reign were not concerned with the Jewish communities.\n\n[[Louis le D\u00e9bonnaire]] (ruled 814-840), faithful to the principles of his father Charlemagne, granted strict protection to Jews, whom he respected as merchants. Like his father, Louis believed that 'the Jewish question' could be solved with the gradual conversion of Jews; according to medieval scholar JM Wollace-Harill, some people believed this tolerance threatened the Christian unity of the Empire, which led to the strengthening of the Bishops at the expense of the Emperor.

When the [[Normans]] disembarked on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, they were taken for Jewish [[merchant]]s. One authority said the Jewish traders boasted about buying whatever they pleased from bishops and abbots. Isaac the Jew, who was sent by Charlemagne in 797 with two ambassadors to [[Harun al-Rashid]], the fifth [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]], was probably one of these merchants.

The initial interest included poetry, which was at times purely liturgical, but which more often was a simple scholastic exercise without aspiration, destined rather to amuse and instruct than to move. Following this came Biblical exegesis, the simple interpretation of the text, with neither daring nor depth, reflecting a complete faith in traditional interpretation, and based by preference on the ''Midrashim'', despite their fantastic character. Finally, and above all, their attention was occupied with the [[Talmud]] and its commentaries. The text of this work, together with that of the writings of the ''[[Geonim]]'', particularly their ''[[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]]'', was first revised and copied; then these writings were treated as a ''[[corpus juris]]'', and were commented upon and studied both as a pious exercise in dialectics and from the practical point of view. There was no philosophy, no natural science, no ''[[belles-lettres]]'', among the French Jews of this period. {{citation needed |date=July 2011}}\n\n====Rashi====\n{{Main|Rashi}}\n\n[[File:Rashi woodcut.jpg|frame]]\nThe great Jewish figure which dominated the second half of the 11th century, as well as the whole rabbinical history of France, was [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) of [[Troyes]] (1040\u20131106). He personified the genius of northern French Judaism: its devoted attachment to tradition; its untroubled faith; its piety, ardent but free from mysticism. His works are distinguished by their clarity, directness, and are written in a simple, concise, unaffected style, suited to his subject.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} His commentary on the [[Talmud]], which was the product of colossal labor, and which eclipsed the similar works of all his predecessors, by its clarity and soundness made easy the study of that vast compilation, and soon became its indispensable complement. Every edition of the Talmud that was ever published has this commentary printed on the same page of the Talmud itself. His commentary on the [[Bible]] (particularly on the Pentateuch), a sort of repertory of the ''[[Midrash]]'', served for edification, but also advanced the taste for seeking the plain and true meaning of the bible. The school which he founded at [[Troyes]], his birthplace, after having followed the teachings of those of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Mainz]], immediately became famous. Around his chair were gathered [[Simhah ben Samuel of Vitry|Sim\u1e25ah b. Samuel]], R. [[Shamuel b. Me\u00efr]] (Rashbam), and Shemaya, his grandsons; likewise [[Shemariah ben Mordecai|Shemaria]], Judah b. Nathan, and [[Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi|Isaac Levi b. Asher]], all of whom continued his work. The school's Talmudic commentaries and interpretations are the basis and starting point for the Ashkenazic tradition of how to interpret and understand the Talmud's explanation of Biblical laws. In many cases these interpretations differ substantially from those of the Sephardim, which results in differences between how Ashkenazim and Sephardim hold what constitutes the practical application of the law. In his Biblical commentaries he availed himself of the works of his contemporaries. Among them must be cited [[Moses ha-Darshan]], chief of the school of Narbonne, who was perhaps the founder of exegetical studies in France, and Menachem b. \u1e24elbo. Thus the 11th century was a period of fruitful activity in literature. Thenceforth French Judaism became one of the poles within Judaism.{{citation needed |date=July 2011}}\n\n=== The Crusades ===\n{{further|Crusades}}\nThe Jews of France suffered during the [[First Crusade]] (1096), when the Crusaders are stated, for example, to have shut up the Jews of Rouen in a church and to have murdered them without distinction of age or sex, sparing only those who accepted baptism. According to a [[Hebrew]] document, the Jews throughout France were at that time in great fear, and wrote to their brothers in the Rhine countries making known to them their terror and asking them to fast and pray. In the Rhineland thousands of Jews were killed by the Crusaders (see [[German Crusade, 1096]]).\n\n===Expulsions and Returns===\n\n====Expulsion from France, 1182====\n[[File:1182 french expulsion of jews.jpg|thumb|325px|A miniature from [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] depicting the expulsion]]\nThe [[German Crusade, 1096|First Crusade]] led to nearly a century of accusations ([[blood libel]]) against the Jews, many of whom were burned or attacked in France. Immediately after the coronation of [[Philip Augustus]] on 14 March 1181, the King ordered the Jews arrested on a Saturday, in all their synagogues, and despoiled of their money and their investments. In the following April 1182, he published an edict of expulsion, but according the Jews a delay of three months for the sale of their personal property. Immovable property, however, such as houses, fields, vines, barns, and wine-presses, he confiscated. The Jews attempted to win over the nobles to their side, but in vain. In July they were compelled to leave the royal domains of France (and not the whole kingdom); their synagogues were converted into churches. These successive measures were simply expedients to fill the royal coffers. The goods confiscated by the king were at once converted into cash.\n\nDuring the century which terminated so disastrously for the Jews their condition was not altogether bad, especially if compared with that of their brethren in Germany. Thus may be explained the remarkable intellectual activity which existed among them, the attraction which it exercised over the Jews of other countries, and the numerous works produced in those days. The impulse given by [[Rashi]] to study did not cease with his death; his successors\u2014the members of his family first among them - continued his work. Research moved within the same limits as in the preceding century, and dealt mainly with the [[Talmud]], rabbinical jurisprudence, and Biblical exegesis.{{citation needed |date=July 2011}}\n\n====Recalled by Philip Augustus, 1198====\nThis century, which opened with the return of the [[Jewish people|Jews]] to France proper (then reduced almost to the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele de France]]), closed with their complete exile from the country in a larger sense. In July 1198, Philip Augustus, \"contrary to the general expectation and despite his own edict, recalled the Jews to Paris and made the churches of God suffer great persecutions\" (Rigord). The king adopted this measure from no good will toward the Jews, for he had shown his true sentiments a short time before in the Bray affair. But since then he had learned that the Jews could be an excellent source of income from a fiscal point of view, especially as money-lenders. Not only did he recall them to his estates, but he gave state sanction by his ordinances to their operations in banking and pawnbroking. He placed their business under control, determined the legal rate of interest, and obliged them to have seals affixed to all their deeds. Naturally this trade was taxed, and the affixing of the royal seal was paid for by the Jews. Henceforward there was in the treasury a special account called \"Produit des Juifs\", and the receipts from this source increased continually. At the same time it was to the interest of the treasury to secure possession of the Jews, considered as a fiscal resource. The Jews were therefore made serfs of the king in the royal domain, just at a time when the charters, becoming wider and wider, tended to bring about the disappearance of serfdom. In certain respects their position became even harder than that of serfs, for the latter could in certain cases appeal to custom and were often protected by the Church; but there was no custom to which the Jews might appeal, and the Church laid them under its ban. The kings and the lords said \"my Jews\" just as they said \"my lands\", and they disposed in like manner of the one and of the other. The lords imitated the king: \"they endeavored to have the Jews considered an inalienable dependence of their fiefs, and to establish the usage that if a Jew domiciled in one barony passed into another, the lord of his former domicil should have the right to seize his possessions.\" This agreement was made in 1198 between the king and the Count of Champagne in a treaty, the terms of which provided that neither should retain in his domains the Jews of the other without the latter's consent, and furthermore that the Jews should not make loans or receive pledges without the express permission of the king and the count. Other lords made similar conventions with the king. Thenceforth they too had a revenue known as the ''Produit des Juifs'', comprising the taille, or annual quit-rent, the legal fees for the writs necessitated by the Jews' law trials, and the seal duty. A thoroughly characteristic feature of this fiscal policy is that the bishops (according to the agreement of 1204 regulating the spheres of ecclesiastical and seigniorial jurisdiction) continued to prohibit the clergy from excommunicating those who sold goods to the Jews or who bought from them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Medieval France: The Community of Champagne|last=Taitz|first=Emily|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=031329318X|location=Westport, CT|oclc=29952366}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of \"retention treaties\" spread throughout France after 1198. Lords intending to impose a heavy tax (''captio'', literally \"capture\") on Jews living in their lordship (''dominium'') signed treaties with their neighbours, whereby the latter refused to permit the former's Jews entry into his domains, thus \"retaining\" them for the lord to tax. This practice arose in response to the common flight of Jews in the face of a ''captio'' to a different ''dominium'', where they purchased the right to settle unmolested by gifts (bribes) to their new lord. In May 1210 the crown negotiated a series of treaties with the neighbours of the [[royal demesne]] and successfully \"captured\" its Jews with a large tax levy. From 1223 on, however the [[Count Palatine of Champagne]] refused to sign any such treaties, and in that year even refused to affirm the crown's asserted right to force non-retention policies on its barons. Such treaties became obsolete after Louis IX's ordinance of Melun (1230), when it became illegal for a Jew to migrate between lordships. This ordinance\u2014the first piece of public legislation in France since [[Carolingian]] times\u2014also declared it [[treason]] to refuse non-retention.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=William Chester|date=1998|title=Jews, Regalian Rights, and the Constitution in Medieval France|journal=AJS Review|volume=23|issue=1|pages=5\u20137|issn=0364-0094|jstor=1486732}}</ref>\n\n====Under Louis VIII====\n[[File:13thcenturyrabbis.jpg|frame|A gathering of thirteenth-century French Rabbis (from the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris).]]\n[[Louis VIII of France]] (1223\u201326), in his ''Etablissement sur les Juifs'' of 1223, while more inspired with the doctrines of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] than his father, Philip Augustus, knew also how to look after the interests of his treasury. Although he declared that from 8 November 1223, the [[interest]] on Jews' debts should no longer hold good, he at the same time ordered that the [[Financial capital|capital]] should be repaid to the Jews in three years and that the debts due the Jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords. The lords then collected the debts for the Jews, doubtless receiving a commission. Louis furthermore ordered that the special seal for Jewish deeds should be abolished and replaced by the ordinary one.\n\nTwenty-six barons accepted Louis VIII's new measures, but [[Theobald I of Navarre|Theobald IV]] (1201\u201353), the powerful [[Count of Champagne|Count]] of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed their safety in return for extra income through taxation.  Champagne's capital at Troyes was where Rashi had lived a century before, and Champagne continued to have a prosperous Jewish population.  Theobald IV would become a major opposition force to Capetian dominance, and his hostility was manifest during the reign of Louis VIII. For example, during the siege of Avignon, he performed only the minimum service of 40 days, and left for home amid charges of treachery.\n\n====Under Louis IX====\nIn spite of all these restrictions designed to restrain, if not to suppress [[moneylender|moneylending]], [[Louis IX of France]] (1226\u201370), with his ardent piety and his submission to the [[Catholic Church]], unreservedly condemned loans at interest. He was less amenable than Philip Augustus to fiscal considerations. Despite former conventions, in an assembly held at Melun in December 1230, he compelled several lords to sign an agreement not to authorize Jews to make any loan. No one in the whole [[Kingdom of France]] was allowed to detain a Jew belonging to another, and each lord might recover a Jew who belonged to him, just as he might his own [[serfdom|serf]] (''tanquam proprium servum''), wherever he might find him and however long a period had elapsed since the Jew had settled elsewhere. At the same time the ordinance of 1223 was enacted afresh, which only proves that it had not been carried into effect. Both king and lords were forbidden to borrow from Jews.\n\nIn 1234, Louis freed his subjects from a third of their registered debts to Jews (including those who had already paid their debts), but debtors had to pay the remaining two-thirds within a specified time. It was also forbidden to imprison Christians or to sell their real estate to recover debts owed to Jews. The king wished in this way to strike a deadly blow at usury.\n\nIn 1243, Louis ordered, at the urging of [[Pope Gregory IX]], the [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|burning in Paris]] of some 12,000 [[manuscript]] copies of the [[Talmud]] and other Jewish works.\n\nIn order to finance his first [[Crusades|Crusade]], Louis ordered the expulsion of all Jews engaged in [[usury]] and the confiscation of their property, for use in his crusade, but the order for the expulsion was only partly enforced if at all. Louis left for the [[Seventh Crusade]] in 1248.\n\nHowever, he did not cancel the debts owed by Christians. Later, Louis became conscience-stricken, and, overcome by scruples, he feared lest the treasury, by retaining some part of the interest paid by the borrowers, might be enriched with the product of usury. As a result, one-third of the debts was forgiven, but the other two-thirds was to be remitted to the royal treasury.\n\nIn 1251, while Louis was in captivity on the Crusade, a popular movement rose up with the intention of traveling to the east to rescue him; although they never made it out of northern France, Jews were subject to their attacks as they wandered throughout the country (see [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusade]]).\n\nIn 1257 or 1258 (\"Ordonnances\", i. 85), wishing, as he says, to provide for his safety of soul and peace of conscience, Louis issued a mandate for the restitution in his name of the amount of usurious interest which had been collected on the confiscated property, the restitution to be made either to those who had paid it or to their heirs.\n\nLater, after having discussed the subject with his son-in-law, King [[Theobald II of Navarre]] and [[Count of Champagne]], Louis decided on 13 September 1268 to arrest Jews and seize their property. But an order which followed close upon this last (1269) shows that on this occasion also Louis reconsidered the matter. Nevertheless, at the request of Paul Christian (Pablo Christiani), he compelled the Jews, under penalty of a fine, to wear at all times the ''rouelle'' or badge decreed by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215. This consisted of a piece of red felt or cloth cut in the form of a wheel, four fingers in circumference, which had to be attached to the outer garment at the chest and back.\n\n==== The Medieval Inquisition ====\n[[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|thumb|Miniature from the [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]] of [[Noah's Ark]] landing on the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (fol. 521a, c. 1278-98)]]\nThe [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which had been instituted in order to suppress [[Catharism]], finally occupied itself with the Jews of Southern France who converted to Christianity. The popes complained that not only were baptized Jews returning to their former faith, but that Christians also were being converted to Judaism. In March 1273, [[Pope Gregory X]] formulated the following rules: relapsed Jews, as well as Christians who abjured their faith in favor of \"the Jewish superstition\", were to be treated by the Inquisitors as heretics. The instigators of such apostasies, as those who received or defended the guilty ones, were to be punished in the same way as the delinquents.\n\nIn accordance with these rules, the Jews of [[Toulouse]], who had buried a Christian convert in their cemetery, were brought before the Inquisition in 1278 for trial, with their rabbi, Isaac Males, being condemned to the stake. [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] at first ordered his [[seneschal]]s not to imprison any Jews at the instance of the Inquisitors, but in 1299 he rescinded this order.\n\n====The Great Exile of 1306====\nToward the middle of 1306 the treasury was nearly empty, and the king, as he was about to do the following year in the case of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], condemned the Jews to banishment, and took forcible possession of their property, real and personal. Their houses, lands, and movable goods were sold at auction; and for the king were reserved any treasures found buried in the dwellings that had belonged to the Jews. That [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury, and was not at all concerned about the well-being of his subjects, is shown by the fact that he put himself in the place of the Jewish moneylenders and exacted from their Christian debtors the payment of their debts, which they themselves had to declare. Furthermore, three months before the sale of the property of the Jews the king took measures to ensure that this event should be coincident with the prohibition of clipped money, in order that those who purchased the goods should have to pay in undebased coin. Finally, fearing that the Jews might have hidden some of their treasures, he declared that one-fifth of any amount found should be paid to the discoverer. It was on 22 July, the day after ''[[Tisha B'Av]]'', a Jewish fast day, that the Jews were arrested. In prison they received notice that they had been sentenced to exile; that, abandoning their goods and debts, and taking only the clothes which they had on their backs and the sum of 12 ''sous tournois'' each, they would have to quit the kingdom within one month. Speaking of this exile, an American Rabbi has said,<blockquote>In striking at the Jews, Philip the Fair at the same time dried up one of the most fruitful sources of the financial, commercial, and industrial prosperity of his kingdom.<ref>{{Citation|title=Jewish Reference Book: B'nai Brith Manual|url=https://archive.org/details/jewishreferenceb00coho|year=1926|page=209|location=Cincinnati, O.|editor=Samuel S.

The span of control of the King of France had increased considerably in extent. Outside the [[\u00cele de France]], it now comprised Champagne, the Vermandois, Normandy, Perche, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou, the Marche, Lyonnais, Auvergne, and Languedoc, reaching from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. The exiles could not take refuge anywhere except in Lorraine, the county of Burgundy, Savoy, Dauphin\u00e9, Roussillon, and a part of Provence \u2013 all regions located in Empire. It is not possible to estimate the number of fugitives; that given by Gr\u00e4tz, 100,000, has no foundation in fact.<ref name=\"Benbassa 1999\" />\n\n====Return of the Jews to France, 1315====\n[[File:14th century Hannukah lamp (hanukiah), France - Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire du Juda\u00efsme.jpg|thumb|A bronze [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkah lamp]] dating from before the expulsion of 1394 [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\nNine years had hardly passed since the expulsion of 1306 when [[Louis X of France]] (1314\u201316) recalled the Jews. In an edict dated 28 July 1315, he permitted them to return for a period of twelve years, authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment. He issued this edict in answer to the demands of the people. [[Geoffrey of Paris]], the popular poet of the time, says in fact that the Jews were gentle in comparison with the Christians who had taken their place, and who had flayed their debtors alive; if the Jews had remained, the country would have been happier; for there were no longer any moneylenders at all.<ref>Bouquet, xxii. 118</ref> The king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view. The profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury, and by recalling the Jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period. It appears that they gave the sum of 122,500 ''[[Livre tournois|livres]]'' for the privilege of returning. It is also probable, as [[Adolphe Vuitry]] states, that a large number of the debts owing to the Jews had not been recovered, and that the holders of the notes had preserved them; the decree of return specified that two thirds of the old debts recovered by the Jews should go into the treasury. The conditions under which they were allowed to settle in the land are set forth in a number of articles; some of the guaranties which were accorded the Jews had probably been demanded by them and been paid for.\n\nThey were to live by the work of their hands or to sell merchandise of a good quality; they were to wear the circular badge, and not discuss religion with laymen. They were not to be molested, either with regard to the chattels they had carried away at the time of their banishment, or with regard to the loans which they had made since then, or in general with regard to anything which had happened in the past. Their synagogues and their cemeteries were to be restored to them on condition that they would refund their value; or, if these could not be restored, the king would give them the necessary sites at a reasonable price. The books of the Law that had not yet been returned to them were also to be restored, with the exception of the Talmud. After the period of twelve years granted to them the king might not expel the Jews again without giving them a year's time in which to dispose of their property and carry away their goods. They were not to lend on usury, and no one was to be forced by the king or his officers to repay to them usurious loans.\n\nIf they engaged in pawnbroking, they were not to take more than two deniers in the pound a week; they were to lend only on pledges. Two men with the title \"auditors of the Jews\" were entrusted with the execution of this ordinance and were to take cognizance of all claims that might arise in connection with goods belonging to the Jews that had been sold before the expulsion for less than half of what was regarded as a fair price. The king finally declared that he took the Jews under his special protection and that he desired to have their persons and property protected from all violence, injury and oppression.\n\n====Expulsion of 1394====\nOn 17 September 1394, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors which the Jews committed against Christians; and that the prosecutors, having made several investigations, had discovered many violations by the Jews of the agreement they had made with him. Therefore, he decreed as an irrevocable law and statute that thenceforth no Jew should dwell in his domains (\"Ordonnances\", vii. 675). According to the [[Michel Pintoin|Religieux de St. Denis]], the king signed this decree at the insistence of the queen (\"Chron. de Charles VI.\" ii. 119).<ref>History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.</ref> The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews in order that they might sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom. Subsequently, the king released the Christians from their debts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barkey|first=Karen|last2=Katznelson|first2=Ira|date=2011|title=States, regimes, and decisions: why Jews were expelled from Medieval England and France|url=http://www.academia.edu/download/36241148/States__regimes__and_decisions-_why_Jews_were_expelled_from_Medieval_England_and_France.pdf|journal=Theory and Society|volume=40|issue=5|pages=475\u2013503|issn=0304-2421|doi=10.1007/s11186-011-9150-8}}</ref>\n\n==Provence==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Arles}}\nArchaeological evidence has been discovered of a Jewish presence in [[Provence]] since at least the 1st century. The earliest documentary evidence for the presence of Jews dates from the middle of the 5th century in [[Arles]]. The Jewish presence reached a peak in 1348, when it probably numbered about 15,000.<ref name=jvl>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/provence|title=Provence|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nProvence was not incorporated into France until 1481, and the expulsion edict of 1394 did not apply there. The privileges of the Jews of Provence were confirmed in 1482. However, from 1484, anti-Jewish disturbances broke out, with looting and violence perpetrated by laborers from outside the region hired for the harvest season. In some places Jews were protected by the town officials, and they were declared to be under royal protection. However, a voluntary exodus began and was accelerated when similar disorders were repeated in 1485.<ref name=jvl /> According to [[Isidore Loeb]], in a special study of the subject in the ''[[Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives]]'' (xiv. 162\u2013183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the [[Alhambra Decree]] expelled Jews from Spain in 1492.\n\nFrom 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. However, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order of the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while \u2013 if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews \u2013 the king imposed a special tax, referred to as \"the tax of the neophytes.\" These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders.<ref name=jvl />\n\nDuring the second half of the 17th century a number of Jews attempted to reestablish themselves in Provence. Before the French Revolution abolished the administrative entity of Provence, the first community outside the southwest, Alsace-Lorraine and Comtat Venaissin, was re-formed in Marseilles.<ref name=jvl />\n\n==Early Modern period==\n[[File:Old Jewish Area Troyes of Rachi France.jpg|thumb|Old Jewish Quarter of [[Troyes]].]]\n\n===17th century===\nIn the beginning of the 17th century Jews began again to re-enter France. This resulted in a new edict of 23 April 1615<ref>See Article 1 of [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/335/ ''The Code Noir'', of 6 May 1687]</ref> which forbade Christians, under the penalty of death and confiscation, to shelter Jews or to converse with them.\n\n[[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] were the home of a significant number of Jews. In annexing the provinces in 1648, [[Louis XIV]] was at first inclined toward the banishment of Jews living in those provinces, but thought better of it in view of the benefit he could derive from them. On 25 September 1675, he granted these Jews [[letters patent]], taking them under his special protection. This, however, did not prevent them from being subjected to every kind of extortion, and their position remained the same as it had been under the Austrian government.\n\nThe [[R\u00e9gence|Regency]] was no less severe. In 1683, Louis XIV expelled Jews from the newly acquired colony of [[Martinique]].\n\n===Beginnings of emancipation===\nBy the 1780s there were about 40,000 to 50,000 Jews in France, chiefly centered in Bordeaux, Metz and a few other cities. They had very limited rights and opportunities, apart from the money-lending business, but their status was not illegal.<ref>Nigel Aston, ''Religion and Revolution in France, 1780-1804 (2000) pp 72-89</ref>\n\nIn the course of the 18th century the attitude of the authorities toward Jews changed for the better. A spirit of tolerance began to prevail, which corrected the iniquities of previous legislation. The authorities often overlooked infractions of the edict of banishment; a colony of [[Portuguese Jews|Portuguese]] and [[German Jews]] was tolerated in Paris. The voices of enlightened Christians who demanded justice for the proscribed people, began to be heard. An [[Alsatian Jews|Alsatian Jew]] named [[Cerf Berr]], who had rendered great service to the [[Political system of France|French government]] as purveyor to the army, was the interpreter of the Jews before Louis XVI. The humane minister, Malesherbes, summoned a commission of Jewish notables to make suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of their coreligionists. The direct result of the efforts of these men was the abolition, in 1785, of the degrading poll-tax and the permission to settle in all parts of France. Shortly afterward the [[Jewish question]] was raised by two men of genius, who subsequently became prominent in the French Revolution\u2014Count [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] and the ''abb\u00e9'' [[Henri Gr\u00e9goire|Gr\u00e9goire]]\u2014the former of whom, while on a diplomatic mission in [[Prussia]], had made the acquaintance of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and his school (see ''[[Haskalah]]''), who were then working toward the intellectual emancipation of the Jews. In a pamphlet, \"Sur Moses Mendelssohn, sur la R\u00e9forme Politique des Juifs\" (London, 1787), Mirabeau refuted the arguments of the German antisemites like Michaelis, and claimed for the Jews the full rights of citizenship. This pamphlet naturally provoked many writings for and against the Jews, and the French public became interested in the question. On the proposition of Roederer the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question: \"What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?\" Nine essays, of which only two were unfavorable to the Jews, were submitted to the judgment of the learned assembly. Of the challenge there were three winners: Abb\u00e9 Gregoire, Claude-Antoine Thiery, and Zalkind Hourwitz.\n\n==The Revolution and Napoleon==\n[[File:Royal decree proclaming the emancipation of the Jews, France, 1791 - Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire du Juda\u00efsme.jpg|thumb|''Loi relative aux Juifs'', the 1791 decree giving the Jews full citizenship [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\nJews in Bordeaux and Bayonne participated in 1789 to the election of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] but those in Alsace, Lorraine and in Paris were denied this right.

The [[Cahiers de dol\u00e9ances|Cahier]] written by the Jewish community from eastern France asked for the end of the discriminatory status and taxes targeting Jews.\n\nThe fall of the [[Bastille]] was the signal for [[Great Fear|disorders]] everywhere in France. In certain districts of Alsace the peasants attacked the dwellings of the Jews, who took refuge in Basel. A gloomy picture of the outrages upon them was sketched before the National Assembly (3 August) by the abb\u00e9 [[Henri Gr\u00e9goire]], who demanded their complete emancipation. The National Assembly shared the indignation of the prelate, but left the question of emancipation undecided; it was intimidated by the deputies of Alsace, especially by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]].<ref name=bpr11 />\n\nOn 22 December 1789, the Jewish question came again before the Assembly in debating the issue of admitting to public service all citizens without distinction of creed. Mirabeau, the abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], [[Adrien Duport|Duport]], [[Antoine Barnave|Barnave]] and the [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre|comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]] exerted all the power of their eloquence to bring about the desired emancipation; but the repeated disturbances in Alsace and the strong opposition of the deputies of that province and of the clericals, like [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|La Fare]], [[Bishop of Nancy]], the [[abb\u00e9 Maury]], and others, caused the decision to be again postponed. Only the Portuguese and the Avignonese Jews, who had hitherto enjoyed all civil rights as naturalized Frenchmen, were declared full citizens by a majority of 150 on 28 January 1790. This partial victory infused new hope into the Jews of the German districts, who made still greater efforts in the struggle for freedom. They won over the eloquent advocate Godard, whose influence in revolutionary circles was considerable. Through his exertions the National Guards and the diverse sections pronounced themselves in favor of the Jews, and the abb\u00e9 Malot was sent by the General Assembly of the Commune to plead their cause before the National Assembly. Unfortunately the grave affairs which absorbed the Assembly, the prolonged agitations in Alsace, and the passions of the clerical party kept in check the active propaganda of the Jews and their friends. A few days before the dissolution of the National Assembly (27 September 1791) a member of the Jacobin Club, formerly a parliamentary councilor, Duport, unexpectedly ascended the tribune and said,<blockquote>I believe that freedom of worship does not permit any distinction in the political rights of citizens on account of their creed. The question of the political existence of the Jews has been postponed. Still the Muslems and the men of all sects are admitted to enjoy political rights in France. I demand that the motion for postponement be withdrawn, and a decree passed that the Jews in France enjoy the privileges of full citizens.</blockquote>This proposition was accepted amid loud applause. Rewbell endeavored, indeed, to oppose the motion, but he was interrupted by Regnault de Saint-Jean, president of the Assembly, who suggested \"that every one who spoke against this motion should be called to order, because he would be opposing the constitution itself\".\n\n===During the Reign of Terror===\nJudaism in France thus became, as the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] deputy Schwendt wrote to his constituents, \"nothing more than the name of a distinct religion\". However, in Alsace, especially in the [[Bas-Rhin]] the reactionaries did not cease their agitations and Jews were victims of discriminations.<ref name=bpr11 /> During the [[Reign of Terror]], at Bordeaux, Jewish bankers, compromised in the cause of the [[Girondists|Girondins]], had to pay important fines or to run away to save their lives while some Jewish bankers (49 according to the Jewish Encyclopedia) were imprisoned at Paris as suspects and nine of them were executed.<ref name=\"hjmedw11\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranee-antique.info/Moyen_Orient/Graetz/HJ_514.htm|title=Chapitre XIV \u2013 La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise et l'\u00e9mancipation des Juifs \u2014 (1789\u20131806).|last=Fournier|first=Fran\u00e7ois-Dominique|publisher=Histoire antique des pays et des hommes de la Mediterrann\u00e9e|work=Histoire des Juifs|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref> The decree of the convention by which the Catholic faith was annulled and replaced by the worship of Reason was applied by the provincial clubs, especially by those of the German districts, to the Jewish religion as well. Some synagogues were pillaged and the mayors of a few eastern towns (Strasbourg, Troyes, etc.) forbade the celebration of Sabbath (to apply the week of ten days).<ref name=hjmedw11 />\n\nMeanwhile, the French Jews gave proofs of their patriotism and of their gratitude to the land that had emancipated them. Many of them died in battle as part of the Army of the Republic while fighting the forces of Europe in coalition. To contribute to the war fund, candelabra of synagogues were sold, and wealthier Jews deprived themselves of their jewels to make similar contributions.\n\n===Attitude of Napoleon===\n{{Main|Napoleon and the Jews}}\n\n[[File:David Sintzheim, chef du grand Sanhedrin.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph David Sinzheim]] was the president of the [[Grand Sanhedrin]], an imperial Jewish high court sanctioned by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]].]]\n\n[[File:\u00c9douard Moyse Sermon dans un oratoire israelite 1897.jpg|thumb|''Sermon in an israelite oratory'' [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\n\nThough the Revolution had begun the process of [[Jewish emancipation]] in France, [[Napoleon]] also spread the concept in the lands he conquered across Europe, liberating Jews from their [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]] and establishing relative equality for them. The net effect of his policies significantly changed the position of the Jews in Europe. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures supporting the position of the Jews in the French Empire, including assembling a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the [[Grand Sanhedrin]]. In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to ghettos. In 1807, he added Judaism as an official religion of France, with previously sanctioned [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. Despite the positive effects, it is unclear however, whether Napoleon himself was disposed favorably towards the Jews, or merely saw them as a political or financial tool. On 17 March 1808, Napoleon rolled back some reforms by the so-called ''d\u00e9cret inf\u00e2me'', declaring all debts with Jews reduced, postponed, or annulled; this caused the Jewish community to nearly collapse. The decree also restricted where Jews could live, especially for those in the eastern [[First French Empire|French Empire]], with all its annexations in the [[Rhineland]] and beyond (as of 1810), in hopes of assimilating them into society. Many of these restrictions were eased again in 1811 and finally abolished in 1818.\n\n==After the Restoration==\nThe restoration of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] did not bring any change in the political condition of the Jews. Such of the enemies of the Jews as cherished the hope that the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] would hasten to undo the work of the Revolution with regard to Jewish emancipation were soon disappointed. The emancipation the French Jews had made such progress that the most clerical monarch could not find any pretext for curtailing their rights as citizens. They were no longer treated as poor, downtrodden peddlers{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} or money-lenders with whom every petty official could do as he liked. Many of them already occupied high positions in the army and the magistracy, as well as in the arts and sciences.\n\n===State recognition===\nOf the faiths recognized by the state, only Judaism had to support its ministers, while those of the Catholic and Protestant churches were supported by the government. This legal inferiority was removed in that year, thanks to the intervention of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and to the campaign led in Parliament by the deputies [[Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau|comte de Rambuteau]] and [[Jean-Pons-Guillaume Viennet|Jean Viennet]]. Encouraged by these prominent men, the minister of education, on 13 November 1830, offered a motion to place Judaism upon an equal footing with Catholicism and Protestantism as regards support for the synagogues and for the rabbis from the public treasury. The motion was accompanied by flattering compliments to the French Jews, \"who\", said the minister, \"since the removal of their [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] by the Revolution, have shown themselves worthy of the privileges granted them\". After a short discussion the motion was adopted by a large majority. In January 1831, it passed in the Chamber of Peers by 89 votes to 57, and on 8 February it was ratified by King Louis Philippe, who from the beginning had shown himself favorable to placing Judaism on an equal footing with the other faiths. Shortly afterward the rabbinical college, which had been founded at Metz in 1829, was recognized as a state institution, and was granted a subsidy. The government likewise liquidated the debts contracted by various Jewish communities before the Revolution.\n\n=== Full equality ===\nFull equality did not occur until 1831. By the fourth decade of the nineteenth century, France provided an environment in which Jews took active and many times leading roles. The Napoleonic policy of ''carri\u00e8res aux talents'' 'careers for the gifted' permitted French Jews to enter previously forbidden fields such as the arts, finance, trade, and government. For this they were never forgiven by primarily Royalist and Catholic antisemites.\n\n===Assimilation===\n[[File:Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux by Lecomte du Nouy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]], founder of the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] - [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme]]]]\nWhile the Jews had been placed in every point the equals of their Christian fellow citizens, the oath ''[[More Judaico]]'' still continued to be administered to them, in spite of the repeated protestations of the rabbis and the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistory]]. It was only in 1846, owing to a brilliant speech of the Jewish lawyer [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]], pronounced before the Court of N\u00eemes in defense of a rabbi who had refused to take this oath, and to a valuable essay on the subject by Martin, a prominent Christian advocate of Strasburg, that the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] removed this last remnant of the legislation of the Middle Ages. With this act of justice the history of the Jews of France merges into the general history of the French people. The rapidity with which many of them won affluence and distinction in the nineteenth century is without parallel. In spite of the deep-rooted prejudices which prevailed in certain classes of French society, many of them occupied high positions in literature, art, science, jurisprudence, the army\u2014indeed, in every walk of life.  In 1860, the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]] was formed \"to work everywhere for the emancipation and moral progress of the Jews; to offer effective assistance to Jews suffering from antisemitism; and to encourage all publications calculated to promote this aim.\" <ref name=\"Jewish Virtual Library 2019\">{{cite web | title=Alliance Israelite Universelle | website=Jewish Virtual Library | date=8 April 2019 | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00834.html | access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870 the approximately 40,000 Jews of [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], at that time a French ''d\u00e9partement'', were automatically granted [[French citizenship]] by the ''[[Cr\u00e9mieux Decree|Cr\u00e9mieux decrees]]'', contrary to their Muslim neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maitre-eolas.fr/2007/08/18/694-l-affaire-de-la-consonnance-isralite-du-nom-de-famille|title=L'affaire de la \"consonnance isra\u00e9lite\" du nom de famille|work=Journal d'un avocat|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nPeople of Jewish faith in France were becoming assimilated into their lives. After their Emancipation in 1791, Jews in France had new freedoms. For example, Jews were allowed to attend schools that were once delegated for just non-Jews. They were also allowed to pray in their own synagogues. Lastly, many Jews found themselves moving from the rural areas of France and into the big cities. In these big cities, Jews had new job opportunities and many were advancing up the economic ladder.\n\n[[File:1893 La-Libre-Parole-antisemitische-Karikatur.jpg|thumb|1893 edition of [[Edouard Drumont]]'s antisemitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''.]]\nAlthough life was looking brighter for these Western Jews, some Jews who lived in Eastern Europe believed that the Emancipation in Western countries were causing the Jews to lose their traditional beliefs and culture. As more and more Jews were becoming assimilated into their new lives, these Jews were breaking away from rabbinical law and rabbinical authority decreased. For example, Jews were marrying outside of their religion and their children were growing up in homes where they were not being introduced to traditional beliefs and losing connection with their roots. Also, in these new urbanized Jewish homes, less and less Jews were following the strict laws of Kosher laws. Many Jews were so preoccupied with assimilating and prospering in their new lives that they formed a new type of Judaism that would fit with the times. The Reform Movement came about to let Jews stay connected to their roots while also living their lives without so many restrictions.\n\n===Antisemitism===\n[[Alphonse Toussenel]] (1803-1885) was a political writer and zoologist who introduced antisemitism into French mainstream thinking.  A [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] and a disciple of [[Charles Fourier]]. He criticized the economic liberalism of the July Monarchy and denounced the ills of civilization: individualism, egoism, and class conflict.  He was hostile to the Jews and also to the British. Toussenel's  ''Les juifs rois de l'\u00e9poque, histoire de la f\u00e9odalit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re'' (1845) argued that French finance and commerce was controlled by an alien' Jewish presence, typified in the malign influence of the [[Rothschild banking family of France]].  Toussenel's antisemitism was rooted in a revolutionary-nationalist interpretation reading of French history. He was innovative and using zoology as a vehicle for social criticism, and his natural history books, as much as his political writings, were infused with antisemitic and anti-English sentiments. For Toussenel, the English and the Jews represented external and internal threats to French national identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crossley|first=Ceri|date=2004|title=Anglophobia and anti-Semitism: The case of Alphonse Toussenel (1803-1885)|journal=Modern & Contemporary France|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=459\u2013472|doi=10.1080/0963948042000284722|issn=0963-9489}}</ref>\n\nAntisemitism based on racism emerged in the 1880s led by  [[Edouard Drumont]], who founded the [[Antisemitic League of France]] in 1889, and was the founder and editor of the newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''.  After spending years of research, he synthesized three major strands of antisemitism. The first strand was traditional Catholic attitudes toward the \"Christ killers\" augmented by vehement antipathy toward the French Revolution. The second strand was hostility to capitalism, of the sort promoted by the Socialist movement. The third strand was scientific racism, based on the argument that races have fixed characteristics, and the Jews have highly negative characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism : a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|others=Levy, Richard S.|isbn=1851094393|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=58830958}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism during the French Second Empire|last=Isser|first=Natalie|date=1991|publisher=Lang|isbn=9780820414546|location=New York; Bern; Frankfurt am Main; Paris|pages=|language=English|oclc=243444805}}</ref>\n\n==Dreyfus affair==\n[[File:J\u2019accuse.jpg|thumb|Newspaper front page with [[\u00c9mile Zola]]'s letter, ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'' (I Accuse), addressing the President of the Republic, and accusing the government with antisemitism in the [[Dreyfus affair]].]]\n{{main|Dreyfus affair}}\nThe ''Dreyfus affair'' was a major political scandal that convulsed France from 1894 until its resolution in 1906, and then had reverberations for decades more. The affair is often seen as a modern and universal symbol of injustice<ref>Guy Canivet, first President of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Supreme Court]], ''Justice from the Dreyfus Affair'', p. 15.</ref> for reasons of state and remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice where a central role was played by the press and public opinion.  The issue was blatant antisemitism as practiced by the Army and defended by traditionalists (especially Catholics) against secular and republican forces, including most Jews. In the end the latter triumphed.<ref>Piers Paul Read, ''The Dreyfus Affair'' (2012)</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Stephen|date=1976|title=Antisemitism and Jewish Response in France during the Dreyfus Affair|journal=European Studies Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=225\u2013248|doi=10.1177/026569147600600203|issn=0014-3111}}</ref>\n\nThe affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a young French artillery officer of [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish descent]]. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly having communicated French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris, Dreyfus was sent to the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]], where he spent almost five years.\n\nTwo years later, in 1896, evidence came to light identifying a French Army major named [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]] as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after the second day of his trial. The Army accused Dreyfus of additional charges based on false documents. Word of the military court's framing of Dreyfus and of an attendant cover-up began to spread, chiefly owing to ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'', a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Activists put pressure on the government to reopen the case.\n\nIn 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \"Dreyfusards\"), such as [[Anatole France]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as [[\u00c9douard Drumont]], the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against Alfred Dreyfus were demonstrated to be baseless. In 1906 Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the French Army.\n\nThe Affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army, mostly Catholic \"anti-Dreyfusards\" who generally lost the initiative to the anticlerical, pro-republican Dreyfusards. It embittered French politics and allowed the radicals to come to power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315842639|title=The Dreyfus Affair in French Society and Politics|year=2014|last=Cahm|first=Eric|isbn=9781315842639|location=Oxfordshire, England|oclc=889266445}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=France and the Dreyfus Affair: A Documentary History|last=Burns|first=Michael|date=1999|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|isbn=0312111673|location=Boston|oclc=40593627}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nThe relatively small Jewish community was based in Paris, and very well established in the city's business, financial, and intellectual elite. A third of Parisian bankers were Jewish, led by the [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschild family]], which also played a dominant role in the well organized Jewish community. Many of the most influential French intellectuals were nominally Jewish, including [[Henri Bergson]], [[Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl]] and  [[Emile Durkheim]]. The Dreyfus affair to some degree rekindled their sense of being Jewish.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=Pierre|date=1995|title=French Jewish Sociologists Between Reason and Faith: The Impact of the Dreyfus Affair|journal=Jewish Social Studies|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201335|issn=0021-6704|jstor=4467459}}</ref> Jews were prominent in art and culture, typified by such artists as [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]], [[Soutine]], and [[Chagall]]. The Jews considered themselves fully assimilated into French culture, for them Judaism was entirely a matter of religious belief, with minimal ethnic or cultural dimensions.<ref>Hyman, ''From Dreyfus to Vichy : the remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939'' pp 18-49.</ref>\n\nBy the time Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906, antisemitism declined sharply and it declined again during the First World War, as a nation was aware that many Jews died fighting for France. The antisemitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]'' closed in 1924, and the former anti-Dreyfusard [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] included Jews among France's \"spiritual families\".  However it soared during the 1930s.<ref>Hyman, ''From Dreyfus to Vichy : the remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939'' pp 54-57, 199-202.</ref>\n\nAfter 1900, a wave of Jewish immigrants arrived, mostly fleeing the [[pogroms]] of Eastern Europe. The flow temporarily halted during World War I but resumed afterwards. The long-established, heavily assimilated Jewish population by 1920 was now only a third of the French Jewish population. It was overwhelmed by new immigrants and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine. About 200,000 immigrants arrived, 1900 to 1939, mostly Yiddish-speakers from Russia and Poland as well as German-speaking Jews who fled the Nazi regime after 1933. The historic base of traditional Judaism was in Alsace-Lorraine, which was recovered by France in 1918.\n\nThe new arrivals got along poorly with the established elite Jewish community. They did not want to assimilate, and they vigorously supported such new causes, especially Zionism and communism.<ref>Hyman, ''From Dreyfus to Vichy: The Remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939'' (1979) pp 63-88.</ref>  The Yiddish influx and the Jewishness of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]'s leader [[L\u00e9on Blum]] contributed to a revival of antisemitism in the 1930s. Conservative writers such as [[Paul Morand]], [[Pierre Gaxotte]], [[Marcel Jouhandeau]], and the leader of  ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' [[Charles Maurras]] denounced Jews. Perhaps the most violent antisemitic writer was [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]], who wrote, \"I feel myself very friendly to Hitler, and to all Germans, whom I feel to be my brothers.... Our real enemies are Jews and Masons\", and \"Yids are like bedbugs.\"\n\nBy 1937, even mainstream French conservatives and socialists, not previously associated with antisemitism, denounced the alleged Jewish influence pushing the country into a \"Jewish war\" against Nazi Germany. The new intensity of antisemitism facilitated the extremism of the Vichy regime after 1940.<ref>{{cite book|author=Julian Jackson|title=France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtLSly2RN2wC&pg=PT184|year=2003|pages=184\u201386|isbn=9780191622885}}</ref>\n\n===World War II and the Holocaust===\n{{main|The Holocaust in France}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0211-500, Frankreich, Antisemitismus, Ausstellung.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antisemitic Exposition during Nazi occupation of France (1942).]]\nWhen [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|France came under occupation by Nazi Germany]] in June 1940, there were about 330,000 Jews living in France (and 370 000 in French North Africa). Of the 330,000, fewer than half held French citizenship. The others were foreigners, mostly exiles from Germany and Central Europe who had immigrated to France during the 1930s.<ref name=USHMM>{{cite web|title=France|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005429|work=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]}}</ref> Another 110,000 French Jews were living in the colony of French Algeria.<ref name=HDJEF>{{cite book|last=Blumenkranz|first=Bernhard|title=Histoire des Juifs en France|date=1972|publisher=Privat|location=Toulouse|pages=376}}</ref>\n\nAbout 200,000 Jews, and the large majority of foreign Jews, resided in the Paris area. Among the 150,000 French Jews, about 30,000, generally native to Central Europe, had obtained French citizenship after immigrating to France during the 1930s. Following the 1940 armistice after Germany occupied France, the Nazis incorporated the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine into Germany. The remainder of northern and western France was placed under German military control. Unoccupied southern metropolitan France and the French empire were placed under the control of the [[Vichy Regime]], a new collaborationist French government. Some Jews managed to escape the invading German forces. Some found refuge in the countryside. Spain allowed 25,600 Jews to use its territory as an escape route.\n\nGerman occupation forces published their first anti-Jewish measure on 27 September 1940 as the \"First Ordinance.\" The measure was a census of Jews, and defined \"[[who is a Jew]].\" The Second Ordinance was published on 18 October 1940, proscribing various business activities for Jews. On 31 August 1941 German forces confiscated all radios belonging to Jews, followed by their telephones, their bicycles, and disconnecting all phones to Jews. They were forbidden to use public telephones. Jews were forbidden to change their address, and next were forbidden to leave their homes between 8 pm and 5 am. All public places, parks, theatres and certain shops were soon closed to Jews. German forces issued new restrictions, prohibitions and decrees by the week. Jews were barred from public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts, music halls, etc. On the metro, they were allowed to ride only in the last carriage. Antisemitic articles were frequently published in newspapers since the Occupation. The Germans organized antisemitic exhibitions to spread their propaganda. The music of Jewish composers was banned, as were works of art by Jewish artists. On 2 October 1941, seven synagogues were bombed.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DrancyConcentrationCamp.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Drancy internment camp|internment camp at Drancy]], outside Paris, where Jews were confined until they were deported to the [[death camps]].]] -->\nThe first roundup of Jews took place on 14 May 1941, and 4,000 foreign Jews were taken captive. Another roundup took place on 20 August 1941, collecting both French and foreign Jews, who were sent to the [[Drancy internment camp]] and other [[concentration camps in France]]. Roundups continued, collecting French nationals, including  lawyers and other professionals. On 12 December 1941, the most distinguished members of the Paris Jewish community, including doctors, academics, scientists and writers, were rounded up. On 29 May 1942, the Eighth Ordinance was published, which ordered Jews to wear the [[Yellow badge#Nazi Europe|yellow star]]. The most notorious roundup was the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]], which required detailed planning and the use of the full resources of French police forces. This roundup took place on 16 and 17 July 1942; it collected nearly 13,000 Jews, 7,000 of whom, including more than 4,000 children, were interned and locked into the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver, without adequate food or sanitation.\n\nIn the meantime, the Germans began deportations of Jews from France to the death camps in eastern Europe. The first trains left on 27 March 1942. Deportations continued until 17 August 1944, by which time nearly 76,000 Jews (including those from Vichy France) were deported, of whom only 2,500 survived. (see [[Timeline of deportations of French Jews to death camps]].) The majority of Jews deported were non-French Jews.<ref name=USHMM/> One quarter of the pre-war Jewish population of France was killed in that process.\n\nAntisemitism was particularly virulent in Vichy France, which controlled a third of France fr\nom 1940 to 42, when the Germans took over that southern area. Vichy's Jewish policy was a mixture of 1930s antiforeigner legislation with the virulent antisemitism of the Action Fran\u00e7aise movement.<ref>Jacques Adler,  \"The Jews and Vichy: reflections on French historiography.\" ''Historical Journal'' 44.4 (2001): 1065-1082.</ref> The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps. As early as October 1940, without any request from the Germans, the Vichy government passed anti-Jewish measures (the [[Vichy laws on the status of Jews]]), prohibiting them from moving, and limiting their access to public places and most professional activities, especially the practice of medicine. The Vichy government also implemented those anti-Jewish laws in the colonies of Vichy North Africa. In 1941, the Vichy government established a ''[[Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux questions juives (1941-1944)]],'' which in 1942 worked with the [[Gestapo]] to round-up Jews. They participated in the Vel' d'Hiv roundup on 16 and 17 July 1942.\n\nOn the other hand, France is recognised as the nation with the third highest number of [[Righteous Among the Nations]] (according to the [[Yad Vashem]] museum, 2006). This award is given to \"non-Jews who acted according to the most noble principles of humanity by risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.\"\n\nIn 1995 French President [[Jacques Chirac]] formally apologized to the Jewish community for the complicit role that French policemen and civil servants played in the roundups. He said:\n\n:\"These black hours will stain our history for ever and are an injury to our past and our traditions. Yes, the criminal madness of the occupant was assisted ('second\u00e9e') by the French, by the French state. Fifty-three years ago, on 16 July 1942, 4500 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders, obeyed the demands of the Nazis.

There has been a Jewish presence in France since at least the [[early Middle Ages]]. France was a center of Jewish learning in the [[Middle Ages]], but [[persecution of Jews|persecution]] increased as the Middle Ages wore on, including multiple expulsions and returns. During the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century, France was the first country in Europe to [[Jewish emancipation|emancipate its Jewish]] population. [[Antisemitism]] has occurred in cycles, reaching a high level in the 1890s, as shown in the [[Dreyfus affair]], and in the 1940s, under the Nazi German occupation and the [[Vichy regime]].\n\nBefore 1919, the Jewish population was largely based in Paris; many were very proud to be fully assimilated into French culture, and comprised an upscale subgroup. But a more traditional Judaism was based in Alsace-Lorraine, which was taken by Germany in 1871 and recovered by France in 1918 following World War I. In addition, numerous Jewish refugees and immigrants came from Russia and eastern and central Europe in the early 20th century, changing the character of French Judaism in the 1920s and 1930s. They were much less interested in full assimilation into French culture. Some supported such new causes as [[Zionism]], the [[Popular Front]] and Communism (the latter two were popular among the French political left).\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Vichy government collaborated with [[Nazi occupation of France|Nazi occupiers]] to deport numerous French and foreign Jewish refugees to [[concentration camp]]s.<ref name=USHMM/> By the war's end, 25% of the French Jewish population had been lost to the [[Holocaust]], but this was a lower proportion killed than in most other countries under Nazi occupation.<ref name=\"bseditions.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedie.bseditions.fr/article.php?pArticleId=158&pChapitreId=23982&pArticleLib=Le+Bilan+de+la+Shoah+en+France+%5BLe+r%E9gime+de+Vichy%5D|title=Le Bilan de la Shoah en France [Le r\u00e9gime de Vichy]|work=bseditions.fr}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">[[Yad Vashem]] [http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/yv/en/education/languages/dutch/pdf/article_croes.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, France has the largest [[Jewish population by country|Jewish population]] in Europe and the third-largest Jewish population in the world (after [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]). The [[religion in France|Jewish community in France]] is estimated to be 480,000\u2013550,000, but depends on the [[Who is a Jew?|adopted definition]]. French Jewish communities are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of [[Paris]], which has the largest population; [[Marseille]], with the second-largest population of 70,000; [[Lyon]], [[Nice]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Toulouse]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe majority of French Jews in the 21st century are [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] [[Maghrebi Jews|North African Jews]], many of whom (or their parents) emigrated since the late 20th century from former French colonies of [[French North Africa|North Africa]] after those countries became independent. They migrated to France beginning in the late 20th century. They span a range of religious affiliations, from the ultra-Orthodox [[Haredi]] communities to the large segment of Jews who are entirely [[Secular Jew|secular]] and who commonly marry outside the Jewish community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioscope.com/notes/2002/111_juifs_france.htm|publisher=Religioscope|title=France : Un portrait de la population juive}}</ref>\n\nApproximately 200,000 [[French Jews in Israel|French Jews live in Israel]].

From 163 B.C.E. there is evidence of Jews in Rome [...]. In the year 6 C.E. there were Jews at [[Vienne, France|Vienne]] and [[Gallia Celtica]]; in the year 39 at [[Lugdunum]] (i.e. [[Lyon]])\".<ref name=\"1906enc\"/>\n\nAn early account praised [[Hilary of Poitiers]] (died 366) for having fled from the Jewish society. The emperors [[Theodosius II]] and [[Valentinian III]] sent a decree to Amatius, prefect of [[Gaul]] (9 July 425), that prohibited Jews and pagans from practising law or holding public offices (''militandi''). This was to prevent Christians being subject to them and possibly incited to change their faith. At the funeral of [[Hilary, Bishop of Arles]], in 449, Jews and Christians mingled in crowds and wept; the former were said to have sung psalms in Hebrew. From the year 465 the Church acknowledged the Jews.<!-- meaning? --><ref name=\"1906enc\"/>\n\nIn the sixth century, Jews were documented in Marseilles, [[Arles]], [[Uz\u00e8s]], [[Narbonne]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], Paris, and [[Bordeaux]]. These places were generally centers of Roman administration, and located on the great commercial routes. The Jews built [[synagogues]] in these centers. In harmony with the [[Theodosian code]], and according to an edict of 331 by the emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], the Jews were organized for religious purposes as they were in the Roman empire. They appear to have had priests ([[rabbis]] or [[\u1e25azzanim]]), archisynagogues, patersynagogues, and other synagogue officials. The Jews worked principally as merchants, as they were prohibited from owning land; they also served as tax-collectors, sailors, and physicians.<ref name=\"1906enc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6262-france|title=France|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>\n\nThey probably remained under Roman law until the triumph of Christianity, with the status established by [[Caracalla]], on a footing of equality with their fellow citizens. Their association with fellow citizens was generally amicable, even after the establishment of Christianity in Gaul. The Christian clergy participated in some Jewish feasts; intermarriage between Jews and Christians sometimes occurred; and the Jews made proselytes. Worried about Christians adopting Jewish religious customs, the third [[Third Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Council of Orl\u00e9ans]] (539) warned the faithful against Jewish \"superstitions\", and ordered them to abstain from traveling on Sunday and from adorning their persons or dwellings on that day. In the 6th century, a Jewish community thrived in Paris.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary.org\"/> They built a synagogue on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, but it was later torn down by Christians, who erected a church on the site.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary.org\"/>\n\nIn 629, [[Dagobert I|King Dagobert]] proposed the expulsion of all Jews who would not accept Christianity. No mention of the Jews was found from his reign to that of [[Pepin the Short]]. But in [[Southern France]], then known as [[Septimania]] and a dependency of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kings of Spain, the Jews continued to dwell and to prosper. From this epoch (689) dates the earliest known Jewish inscription relating to France, that of Narbonne. The Jews of Narbonne, chiefly merchants, were popular among the people, who often rebelled against the Visigothic kings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hosang|first=F. J.

Exchanges with the Orient strongly declined with the presence of [[Saracens]] [[Muslim conquests|in the Mediterranean sea]]. Trading and importing of oriental products such as [[gold]], [[silk]], [[black pepper]] or [[papyrus]] almost disappeared under the [[Carolingians]]. The [[Radhanite]] [[Jewish people|Jewish]] traders were nearly the only group to maintain trade between the Occident and the Orient.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mahomet et Charlemagne (reprint of 1937 classic)|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2001|isbn=0-486-42011-6|pages=123\u2013128|language=fr|author=Henri Pirenne|author-link=Henri Pirenne}}</ref>\n\nCharlemagne fixed a formula for the Jewish oath to the state. He allowed Jews to enter into lawsuits with [[Christianity|Christians]]. They were not allowed to require Christians to work on Sunday. Jews were not allowed to trade in [[currency]], [[wine]], or grain. Legally, Jews belonged to the emperor, and could be tried only by him.  But the numerous provincial councils which met during Charlemagne's reign were not concerned with the Jewish communities.\n\n[[Louis le D\u00e9bonnaire]] (ruled 814-840), faithful to the principles of his father Charlemagne, granted strict protection to Jews, whom he respected as merchants. Like his father, Louis believed that 'the Jewish question' could be solved with the gradual conversion of Jews; according to medieval scholar JM Wollace-Harill, some people believed this tolerance threatened the Christian unity of the Empire, which led to the strengthening of the Bishops at the expense of the Emperor. Saint Agobard of Lyon (779-841) had many run-ins with the Jews of France. He wrote about how rich and powerful they were becoming. Scholars such as Jeremy Cohen<ref name=\"Cohen 1999 p.139\">{{cite book | last=Cohen | first=Jeremy | title=Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley, Calif | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-520-92291-4 | oclc=48139723 | pages=139\u2013141}}</ref> suggest that Saint Agobard's belief in Jewish power contributed to his involvement in violent revolutions attempting to dethrone [[Louis the Pious]] in the early 830s.<ref name=\"Fordham Homepage 1996\">{{cite web | title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project | website=Fordham Homepage | date=26 January 1996 | url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/source/agobard-insolence.asp | accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref> Lothar and Agobard's entreaties to [[Pope Gregory IV]], gained them Papal support for the overthrow of Emperor Louis.  Upon Louis the Pious' return to power in 834, he deposed Saint Agobard from his see, to the consternation of Rome. There were unsubstantiated rumors in this period that [[Louis the Pious|Louis']], second wife Judith was a converted Jew, as she would not accept the ''[[Ordinatio]]'' for their first child.\n\nJews were engaged in export trade, particularly traveling to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] under Charlemagne. When the [[Normans]] disembarked on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, they were taken for Jewish [[merchant]]s. One authority said the Jewish traders boasted about buying whatever they pleased from bishops and abbots. Isaac the Jew, who was sent by Charlemagne in 797 with two ambassadors to [[Harun al-Rashid]], the fifth [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]], was probably one of these merchants. He was said to have asked the Baghdad caliph for a rabbi to instruct the Jews whom he had allowed to settle at [[Narbonne]] (see [[History of the Jews in Iraq|History of the Jews in Babylonia]]).\n\n==Capetians==\n\n===Persecutions under the Capets (987\u20131137)===\n[[File:FrenchJews1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Various costumes of medieval French Jews.]]\nThere were widespread persecutions of Jews in France beginning in 1007 or 1009.<ref name=\"Golb 1998\">{{cite book | last=Golb | first=Norman | title=The Jews in medieval Normandy : a social and intellectual history | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-521-58032-8 | oclc=36461619 | page=}}</ref> These persecutions, instigated by [[Robert II of France|Robert II]] (972\u20131031), King of France (987\u20131031), called \"the Pious\", are described in a Hebrew pamphlet,<ref>Published in Berliner's ''Magazin'' iii. 46-48, Hebrew part, reproducing ''Parma De Rossi'' MS.

According to Ad\u00e9mar, Christians urged by [[Pope Sergius IV]]<ref>''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Scriptores, iv. 137.</ref> were shocked by the destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulcher]] in [[Jerusalem]] by the Muslims in 1009. After the destruction, European reaction to the rumor of the letter was of shock and dismay, [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[monk]] [[Rodulfus Glaber]] blamed the [[Jews]] for the destruction. In that year [[Alduin, Bishop of Limoges|Alduin]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limoges|Bishop of Limoges]] (bishop 990-1012), offered the Jews of his diocese the choice between [[baptism]] and exile.

Some were driven out of the cities, others were put to death, while some killed themselves; only a few remained in all the \"Roman world\". Count Paul Riant (1836-1888) says that this whole story of the relations between the Jews and the Mohammedans is only one of those popular legends with which the chronicles of the time abound.<ref>''Inventaire Critique des Lettres Historiques des Croisades - 786-1100'' by Paul Edouard Didier Riant (Paris, 1880) p. 38.

The initial interest included poetry, which was at times purely liturgical, but which more often was a simple scholastic exercise without aspiration, destined rather to amuse and instruct than to move. Following this came Biblical exegesis, the simple interpretation of the text, with neither daring nor depth, reflecting a complete faith in traditional interpretation, and based by preference on the ''Midrashim'', despite their fantastic character. Finally, and above all, their attention was occupied with the [[Talmud]] and its commentaries. The text of this work, together with that of the writings of the ''[[Geonim]]'', particularly their ''[[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]]'', was first revised and copied; then these writings were treated as a ''[[corpus juris]]'', and were commented upon and studied both as a pious exercise in dialectics and from the practical point of view. There was no philosophy, no natural science, no ''[[belles-lettres]]'', among the French Jews of this period. {{citation needed |date=July 2011}}\n\n====Rashi====\n{{Main|Rashi}}\n\n[[File:Rashi woodcut.jpg|frame]]\nThe great Jewish figure which dominated the second half of the 11th century, as well as the whole rabbinical history of France, was [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) of [[Troyes]] (1040\u20131106). He personified the genius of northern French Judaism: its devoted attachment to tradition; its untroubled faith; its piety, ardent but free from mysticism. His works are distinguished by their clarity, directness, and are written in a simple, concise, unaffected style, suited to his subject.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} His commentary on the [[Talmud]], which was the product of colossal labor, and which eclipsed the similar works of all his predecessors, by its clarity and soundness made easy the study of that vast compilation, and soon became its indispensable complement. Every edition of the Talmud that was ever published has this commentary printed on the same page of the Talmud itself. His commentary on the [[Bible]] (particularly on the Pentateuch), a sort of repertory of the ''[[Midrash]]'', served for edification, but also advanced the taste for seeking the plain and true meaning of the bible. The school which he founded at [[Troyes]], his birthplace, after having followed the teachings of those of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Mainz]], immediately became famous. Around his chair were gathered [[Simhah ben Samuel of Vitry|Sim\u1e25ah b. Samuel]], R. [[Shamuel b. Me\u00efr]] (Rashbam), and Shemaya, his grandsons; likewise [[Shemariah ben Mordecai|Shemaria]], Judah b. Nathan, and [[Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi|Isaac Levi b. Asher]], all of whom continued his work. The school's Talmudic commentaries and interpretations are the basis and starting point for the Ashkenazic tradition of how to interpret and understand the Talmud's explanation of Biblical laws. In many cases these interpretations differ substantially from those of the Sephardim, which results in differences between how Ashkenazim and Sephardim hold what constitutes the practical application of the law. In his Biblical commentaries he availed himself of the works of his contemporaries. Among them must be cited [[Moses ha-Darshan]], chief of the school of Narbonne, who was perhaps the founder of exegetical studies in France, and Menachem b. \u1e24elbo. Thus the 11th century was a period of fruitful activity in literature. Thenceforth French Judaism became one of the poles within Judaism.{{citation needed |date=July 2011}}\n\n=== The Crusades ===\n{{further|Crusades}}\nThe Jews of France suffered during the [[First Crusade]] (1096), when the Crusaders are stated, for example, to have shut up the Jews of Rouen in a church and to have murdered them without distinction of age or sex, sparing only those who accepted baptism. According to a [[Hebrew]] document, the Jews throughout France were at that time in great fear, and wrote to their brothers in the Rhine countries making known to them their terror and asking them to fast and pray. In the Rhineland thousands of Jews were killed by the Crusaders (see [[German Crusade, 1096]]).\n\n===Expulsions and Returns===\n\n====Expulsion from France, 1182====\n[[File:1182 french expulsion of jews.jpg|thumb|325px|A miniature from [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] depicting the expulsion]]\nThe [[German Crusade, 1096|First Crusade]] led to nearly a century of accusations ([[blood libel]]) against the Jews, many of whom were burned or attacked in France. Immediately after the coronation of [[Philip Augustus]] on 14 March 1181, the King ordered the Jews arrested on a Saturday, in all their synagogues, and despoiled of their money and their investments. In the following April 1182, he published an edict of expulsion, but according the Jews a delay of three months for the sale of their personal property. Immovable property, however, such as houses, fields, vines, barns, and wine-presses, he confiscated. The Jews attempted to win over the nobles to their side, but in vain. In July they were compelled to leave the royal domains of France (and not the whole kingdom); their synagogues were converted into churches. These successive measures were simply expedients to fill the royal coffers. The goods confiscated by the king were at once converted into cash.\n\nDuring the century which terminated so disastrously for the Jews their condition was not altogether bad, especially if compared with that of their brethren in Germany. Thus may be explained the remarkable intellectual activity which existed among them, the attraction which it exercised over the Jews of other countries, and the numerous works produced in those days. The impulse given by [[Rashi]] to study did not cease with his death; his successors\u2014the members of his family first among them - continued his work. Research moved within the same limits as in the preceding century, and dealt mainly with the [[Talmud]], rabbinical jurisprudence, and Biblical exegesis.{{citation needed |date=July 2011}}\n\n====Recalled by Philip Augustus, 1198====\nThis century, which opened with the return of the [[Jewish people|Jews]] to France proper (then reduced almost to the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele de France]]), closed with their complete exile from the country in a larger sense. In July 1198, Philip Augustus, \"contrary to the general expectation and despite his own edict, recalled the Jews to Paris and made the churches of God suffer great persecutions\" (Rigord). The king adopted this measure from no good will toward the Jews, for he had shown his true sentiments a short time before in the Bray affair. But since then he had learned that the Jews could be an excellent source of income from a fiscal point of view, especially as money-lenders. Not only did he recall them to his estates, but he gave state sanction by his ordinances to their operations in banking and pawnbroking. He placed their business under control, determined the legal rate of interest, and obliged them to have seals affixed to all their deeds. Naturally this trade was taxed, and the affixing of the royal seal was paid for by the Jews. Henceforward there was in the treasury a special account called \"Produit des Juifs\", and the receipts from this source increased continually. At the same time it was to the interest of the treasury to secure possession of the Jews, considered as a fiscal resource. The Jews were therefore made serfs of the king in the royal domain, just at a time when the charters, becoming wider and wider, tended to bring about the disappearance of serfdom. In certain respects their position became even harder than that of serfs, for the latter could in certain cases appeal to custom and were often protected by the Church; but there was no custom to which the Jews might appeal, and the Church laid them under its ban. The kings and the lords said \"my Jews\" just as they said \"my lands\", and they disposed in like manner of the one and of the other. The lords imitated the king: \"they endeavored to have the Jews considered an inalienable dependence of their fiefs, and to establish the usage that if a Jew domiciled in one barony passed into another, the lord of his former domicil should have the right to seize his possessions.\" This agreement was made in 1198 between the king and the Count of Champagne in a treaty, the terms of which provided that neither should retain in his domains the Jews of the other without the latter's consent, and furthermore that the Jews should not make loans or receive pledges without the express permission of the king and the count. Other lords made similar conventions with the king. Thenceforth they too had a revenue known as the ''Produit des Juifs'', comprising the taille, or annual quit-rent, the legal fees for the writs necessitated by the Jews' law trials, and the seal duty. A thoroughly characteristic feature of this fiscal policy is that the bishops (according to the agreement of 1204 regulating the spheres of ecclesiastical and seigniorial jurisdiction) continued to prohibit the clergy from excommunicating those who sold goods to the Jews or who bought from them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Medieval France: The Community of Champagne|last=Taitz|first=Emily|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=031329318X|location=Westport, CT|oclc=29952366}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of \"retention treaties\" spread throughout France after 1198. Lords intending to impose a heavy tax (''captio'', literally \"capture\") on Jews living in their lordship (''dominium'') signed treaties with their neighbours, whereby the latter refused to permit the former's Jews entry into his domains, thus \"retaining\" them for the lord to tax. This practice arose in response to the common flight of Jews in the face of a ''captio'' to a different ''dominium'', where they purchased the right to settle unmolested by gifts (bribes) to their new lord. In May 1210 the crown negotiated a series of treaties with the neighbours of the [[royal demesne]] and successfully \"captured\" its Jews with a large tax levy. From 1223 on, however the [[Count Palatine of Champagne]] refused to sign any such treaties, and in that year even refused to affirm the crown's asserted right to force non-retention policies on its barons. Such treaties became obsolete after Louis IX's ordinance of Melun (1230), when it became illegal for a Jew to migrate between lordships. This ordinance\u2014the first piece of public legislation in France since [[Carolingian]] times\u2014also declared it [[treason]] to refuse non-retention.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=William Chester|date=1998|title=Jews, Regalian Rights, and the Constitution in Medieval France|journal=AJS Review|volume=23|issue=1|pages=5\u20137|issn=0364-0094|jstor=1486732}}</ref>\n\n====Under Louis VIII====\n[[File:13thcenturyrabbis.jpg|frame|A gathering of thirteenth-century French Rabbis (from the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris).]]\n[[Louis VIII of France]] (1223\u201326), in his ''Etablissement sur les Juifs'' of 1223, while more inspired with the doctrines of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] than his father, Philip Augustus, knew also how to look after the interests of his treasury. Although he declared that from 8 November 1223, the [[interest]] on Jews' debts should no longer hold good, he at the same time ordered that the [[Financial capital|capital]] should be repaid to the Jews in three years and that the debts due the Jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords. The lords then collected the debts for the Jews, doubtless receiving a commission. Louis furthermore ordered that the special seal for Jewish deeds should be abolished and replaced by the ordinary one.\n\nTwenty-six barons accepted Louis VIII's new measures, but [[Theobald I of Navarre|Theobald IV]] (1201\u201353), the powerful [[Count of Champagne|Count]] of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed their safety in return for extra income through taxation.  Champagne's capital at Troyes was where Rashi had lived a century before, and Champagne continued to have a prosperous Jewish population.  Theobald IV would become a major opposition force to Capetian dominance, and his hostility was manifest during the reign of Louis VIII. For example, during the siege of Avignon, he performed only the minimum service of 40 days, and left for home amid charges of treachery.\n\n====Under Louis IX====\nIn spite of all these restrictions designed to restrain, if not to suppress [[moneylender|moneylending]], [[Louis IX of France]] (1226\u201370), with his ardent piety and his submission to the [[Catholic Church]], unreservedly condemned loans at interest. He was less amenable than Philip Augustus to fiscal considerations. Despite former conventions, in an assembly held at Melun in December 1230, he compelled several lords to sign an agreement not to authorize Jews to make any loan. No one in the whole [[Kingdom of France]] was allowed to detain a Jew belonging to another, and each lord might recover a Jew who belonged to him, just as he might his own [[serfdom|serf]] (''tanquam proprium servum''), wherever he might find him and however long a period had elapsed since the Jew had settled elsewhere. At the same time the ordinance of 1223 was enacted afresh, which only proves that it had not been carried into effect. Both king and lords were forbidden to borrow from Jews.\n\nIn 1234, Louis freed his subjects from a third of their registered debts to Jews (including those who had already paid their debts), but debtors had to pay the remaining two-thirds within a specified time. It was also forbidden to imprison Christians or to sell their real estate to recover debts owed to Jews. The king wished in this way to strike a deadly blow at usury.\n\nIn 1243, Louis ordered, at the urging of [[Pope Gregory IX]], the [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|burning in Paris]] of some 12,000 [[manuscript]] copies of the [[Talmud]] and other Jewish works.\n\nIn order to finance his first [[Crusades|Crusade]], Louis ordered the expulsion of all Jews engaged in [[usury]] and the confiscation of their property, for use in his crusade, but the order for the expulsion was only partly enforced if at all. Louis left for the [[Seventh Crusade]] in 1248.\n\nHowever, he did not cancel the debts owed by Christians. Later, Louis became conscience-stricken, and, overcome by scruples, he feared lest the treasury, by retaining some part of the interest paid by the borrowers, might be enriched with the product of usury. As a result, one-third of the debts was forgiven, but the other two-thirds was to be remitted to the royal treasury.\n\nIn 1251, while Louis was in captivity on the Crusade, a popular movement rose up with the intention of traveling to the east to rescue him; although they never made it out of northern France, Jews were subject to their attacks as they wandered throughout the country (see [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusade]]).\n\nIn 1257 or 1258 (\"Ordonnances\", i. 85), wishing, as he says, to provide for his safety of soul and peace of conscience, Louis issued a mandate for the restitution in his name of the amount of usurious interest which had been collected on the confiscated property, the restitution to be made either to those who had paid it or to their heirs.\n\nLater, after having discussed the subject with his son-in-law, King [[Theobald II of Navarre]] and [[Count of Champagne]], Louis decided on 13 September 1268 to arrest Jews and seize their property. But an order which followed close upon this last (1269) shows that on this occasion also Louis reconsidered the matter. Nevertheless, at the request of Paul Christian (Pablo Christiani), he compelled the Jews, under penalty of a fine, to wear at all times the ''rouelle'' or badge decreed by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215. This consisted of a piece of red felt or cloth cut in the form of a wheel, four fingers in circumference, which had to be attached to the outer garment at the chest and back.\n\n==== The Medieval Inquisition ====\n[[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|thumb|Miniature from the [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]] of [[Noah's Ark]] landing on the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (fol. 521a, c. 1278-98)]]\nThe [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which had been instituted in order to suppress [[Catharism]], finally occupied itself with the Jews of Southern France who converted to Christianity. The popes complained that not only were baptized Jews returning to their former faith, but that Christians also were being converted to Judaism. In March 1273, [[Pope Gregory X]] formulated the following rules: relapsed Jews, as well as Christians who abjured their faith in favor of \"the Jewish superstition\", were to be treated by the Inquisitors as heretics. The instigators of such apostasies, as those who received or defended the guilty ones, were to be punished in the same way as the delinquents.\n\nIn accordance with these rules, the Jews of [[Toulouse]], who had buried a Christian convert in their cemetery, were brought before the Inquisition in 1278 for trial, with their rabbi, Isaac Males, being condemned to the stake. [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] at first ordered his [[seneschal]]s not to imprison any Jews at the instance of the Inquisitors, but in 1299 he rescinded this order.\n\n====The Great Exile of 1306====\nToward the middle of 1306 the treasury was nearly empty, and the king, as he was about to do the following year in the case of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], condemned the Jews to banishment, and took forcible possession of their property, real and personal. Their houses, lands, and movable goods were sold at auction; and for the king were reserved any treasures found buried in the dwellings that had belonged to the Jews. That [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury, and was not at all concerned about the well-being of his subjects, is shown by the fact that he put himself in the place of the Jewish moneylenders and exacted from their Christian debtors the payment of their debts, which they themselves had to declare. Furthermore, three months before the sale of the property of the Jews the king took measures to ensure that this event should be coincident with the prohibition of clipped money, in order that those who purchased the goods should have to pay in undebased coin. Finally, fearing that the Jews might have hidden some of their treasures, he declared that one-fifth of any amount found should be paid to the discoverer. It was on 22 July, the day after ''[[Tisha B'Av]]'', a Jewish fast day, that the Jews were arrested. In prison they received notice that they had been sentenced to exile; that, abandoning their goods and debts, and taking only the clothes which they had on their backs and the sum of 12 ''sous tournois'' each, they would have to quit the kingdom within one month. Speaking of this exile, an American Rabbi has said,<blockquote>In striking at the Jews, Philip the Fair at the same time dried up one of the most fruitful sources of the financial, commercial, and industrial prosperity of his kingdom.<ref>{{Citation|title=Jewish Reference Book: B'nai Brith Manual|url=https://archive.org/details/jewishreferenceb00coho|year=1926|page=209|location=Cincinnati, O.|editor=Samuel S.

The span of control of the King of France had increased considerably in extent. Outside the [[\u00cele de France]], it now comprised Champagne, the Vermandois, Normandy, Perche, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou, the Marche, Lyonnais, Auvergne, and Languedoc, reaching from the Rh\u00f4ne to the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. The exiles could not take refuge anywhere except in Lorraine, the county of Burgundy, Savoy, Dauphin\u00e9, Roussillon, and a part of Provence \u2013 all regions located in Empire. It is not possible to estimate the number of fugitives; that given by Gr\u00e4tz, 100,000, has no foundation in fact.<ref name=\"Benbassa 1999\" />\n\n====Return of the Jews to France, 1315====\n[[File:14th century Hannukah lamp (hanukiah), France - Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire du Juda\u00efsme.jpg|thumb|A bronze [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkah lamp]] dating from before the expulsion of 1394 [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\nNine years had hardly passed since the expulsion of 1306 when [[Louis X of France]] (1314\u201316) recalled the Jews. In an edict dated 28 July 1315, he permitted them to return for a period of twelve years, authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment. He issued this edict in answer to the demands of the people. [[Geoffrey of Paris]], the popular poet of the time, says in fact that the Jews were gentle in comparison with the Christians who had taken their place, and who had flayed their debtors alive; if the Jews had remained, the country would have been happier; for there were no longer any moneylenders at all.<ref>Bouquet, xxii. 118</ref> The king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view. The profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury, and by recalling the Jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period. It appears that they gave the sum of 122,500 ''[[Livre tournois|livres]]'' for the privilege of returning. It is also probable, as [[Adolphe Vuitry]] states, that a large number of the debts owing to the Jews had not been recovered, and that the holders of the notes had preserved them; the decree of return specified that two thirds of the old debts recovered by the Jews should go into the treasury. The conditions under which they were allowed to settle in the land are set forth in a number of articles; some of the guaranties which were accorded the Jews had probably been demanded by them and been paid for.\n\nThey were to live by the work of their hands or to sell merchandise of a good quality; they were to wear the circular badge, and not discuss religion with laymen. They were not to be molested, either with regard to the chattels they had carried away at the time of their banishment, or with regard to the loans which they had made since then, or in general with regard to anything which had happened in the past. Their synagogues and their cemeteries were to be restored to them on condition that they would refund their value; or, if these could not be restored, the king would give them the necessary sites at a reasonable price. The books of the Law that had not yet been returned to them were also to be restored, with the exception of the Talmud. After the period of twelve years granted to them the king might not expel the Jews again without giving them a year's time in which to dispose of their property and carry away their goods. They were not to lend on usury, and no one was to be forced by the king or his officers to repay to them usurious loans.\n\nIf they engaged in pawnbroking, they were not to take more than two deniers in the pound a week; they were to lend only on pledges. Two men with the title \"auditors of the Jews\" were entrusted with the execution of this ordinance and were to take cognizance of all claims that might arise in connection with goods belonging to the Jews that had been sold before the expulsion for less than half of what was regarded as a fair price. The king finally declared that he took the Jews under his special protection and that he desired to have their persons and property protected from all violence, injury and oppression.\n\n====Expulsion of 1394====\nOn 17 September 1394, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors which the Jews committed against Christians; and that the prosecutors, having made several investigations, had discovered many violations by the Jews of the agreement they had made with him. Therefore, he decreed as an irrevocable law and statute that thenceforth no Jew should dwell in his domains (\"Ordonnances\", vii. 675). According to the [[Michel Pintoin|Religieux de St. Denis]], the king signed this decree at the insistence of the queen (\"Chron. de Charles VI.\" ii. 119).<ref>History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.</ref> The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews in order that they might sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom.

The earliest documentary evidence for the presence of Jews dates from the middle of the 5th century in [[Arles]]. The Jewish presence reached a peak in 1348, when it probably numbered about 15,000.<ref name=jvl>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/provence|title=Provence|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nProvence was not incorporated into France until 1481, and the expulsion edict of 1394 did not apply there. The privileges of the Jews of Provence were confirmed in 1482. However, from 1484, anti-Jewish disturbances broke out, with looting and violence perpetrated by laborers from outside the region hired for the harvest season. In some places Jews were protected by the town officials, and they were declared to be under royal protection. However, a voluntary exodus began and was accelerated when similar disorders were repeated in 1485.<ref name=jvl /> According to [[Isidore Loeb]], in a special study of the subject in the ''[[Revue des \u00c9tudes Juives]]'' (xiv. 162\u2013183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the [[Alhambra Decree]] expelled Jews from Spain in 1492.\n\nFrom 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. However, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order of the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while \u2013 if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews \u2013 the king imposed a special tax, referred to as \"the tax of the neophytes.\" These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders.<ref name=jvl />\n\nDuring the second half of the 17th century a number of Jews attempted to reestablish themselves in Provence. Before the French Revolution abolished the administrative entity of Provence, the first community outside the southwest, Alsace-Lorraine and Comtat Venaissin, was re-formed in Marseilles.<ref name=jvl />\n\n==Early Modern period==\n[[File:Old Jewish Area Troyes of Rachi France.jpg|thumb|Old Jewish Quarter of [[Troyes]].]]\n\n===17th century===\nIn the beginning of the 17th century Jews began again to re-enter France. This resulted in a new edict of 23 April 1615<ref>See Article 1 of [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/335/ ''The Code Noir'', of 6 May 1687]</ref> which forbade Christians, under the penalty of death and confiscation, to shelter Jews or to converse with them.\n\n[[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] were the home of a significant number of Jews. In annexing the provinces in 1648, [[Louis XIV]] was at first inclined toward the banishment of Jews living in those provinces, but thought better of it in view of the benefit he could derive from them. On 25 September 1675, he granted these Jews [[letters patent]], taking them under his special protection. This, however, did not prevent them from being subjected to every kind of extortion, and their position remained the same as it had been under the Austrian government.\n\nThe [[R\u00e9gence|Regency]] was no less severe. In 1683, Louis XIV expelled Jews from the newly acquired colony of [[Martinique]].\n\n===Beginnings of emancipation===\nBy the 1780s there were about 40,000 to 50,000 Jews in France, chiefly centered in Bordeaux, Metz and a few other cities. They had very limited rights and opportunities, apart from the money-lending business, but their status was not illegal.<ref>Nigel Aston, ''Religion and Revolution in France, 1780-1804 (2000) pp 72-89</ref>\n\nIn the course of the 18th century the attitude of the authorities toward Jews changed for the better. A spirit of tolerance began to prevail, which corrected the iniquities of previous legislation. The authorities often overlooked infractions of the edict of banishment; a colony of [[Portuguese Jews|Portuguese]] and [[German Jews]] was tolerated in Paris. The voices of enlightened Christians who demanded justice for the proscribed people, began to be heard. An [[Alsatian Jews|Alsatian Jew]] named [[Cerf Berr]], who had rendered great service to the [[Political system of France|French government]] as purveyor to the army, was the interpreter of the Jews before Louis XVI. The humane minister, Malesherbes, summoned a commission of Jewish notables to make suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of their coreligionists. The direct result of the efforts of these men was the abolition, in 1785, of the degrading poll-tax and the permission to settle in all parts of France. Shortly afterward the [[Jewish question]] was raised by two men of genius, who subsequently became prominent in the French Revolution\u2014Count [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] and the ''abb\u00e9'' [[Henri Gr\u00e9goire|Gr\u00e9goire]]\u2014the former of whom, while on a diplomatic mission in [[Prussia]], had made the acquaintance of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and his school (see ''[[Haskalah]]''), who were then working toward the intellectual emancipation of the Jews. In a pamphlet, \"Sur Moses Mendelssohn, sur la R\u00e9forme Politique des Juifs\" (London, 1787), Mirabeau refuted the arguments of the German antisemites like Michaelis, and claimed for the Jews the full rights of citizenship. This pamphlet naturally provoked many writings for and against the Jews, and the French public became interested in the question. On the proposition of Roederer the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question: \"What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?\" Nine essays, of which only two were unfavorable to the Jews, were submitted to the judgment of the learned assembly. Of the challenge there were three winners: Abb\u00e9 Gregoire, Claude-Antoine Thiery, and Zalkind Hourwitz.\n\n==The Revolution and Napoleon==\n[[File:Royal decree proclaming the emancipation of the Jews, France, 1791 - Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire du Juda\u00efsme.jpg|thumb|''Loi relative aux Juifs'', the 1791 decree giving the Jews full citizenship [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\nJews in Bordeaux and Bayonne participated in 1789 to the election of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] but those in Alsace, Lorraine and in Paris were denied this right.

The [[Cahiers de dol\u00e9ances|Cahier]] written by the Jewish community from eastern France asked for the end of the discriminatory status and taxes targeting Jews.\n\nThe fall of the [[Bastille]] was the signal for [[Great Fear|disorders]] everywhere in France. In certain districts of Alsace the peasants attacked the dwellings of the Jews, who took refuge in Basel. A gloomy picture of the outrages upon them was sketched before the National Assembly (3 August) by the abb\u00e9 [[Henri Gr\u00e9goire]], who demanded their complete emancipation. The National Assembly shared the indignation of the prelate, but left the question of emancipation undecided; it was intimidated by the deputies of Alsace, especially by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]].<ref name=bpr11 />\n\nOn 22 December 1789, the Jewish question came again before the Assembly in debating the issue of admitting to public service all citizens without distinction of creed. Mirabeau, the abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], [[Adrien Duport|Duport]], [[Antoine Barnave|Barnave]] and the [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre|comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]] exerted all the power of their eloquence to bring about the desired emancipation; but the repeated disturbances in Alsace and the strong opposition of the deputies of that province and of the clericals, like [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|La Fare]], [[Bishop of Nancy]], the [[abb\u00e9 Maury]], and others, caused the decision to be again postponed. Only the Portuguese and the Avignonese Jews, who had hitherto enjoyed all civil rights as naturalized Frenchmen, were declared full citizens by a majority of 150 on 28 January 1790. This partial victory infused new hope into the Jews of the German districts, who made still greater efforts in the struggle for freedom. They won over the eloquent advocate Godard, whose influence in revolutionary circles was considerable. Through his exertions the National Guards and the diverse sections pronounced themselves in favor of the Jews, and the abb\u00e9 Malot was sent by the General Assembly of the Commune to plead their cause before the National Assembly. Unfortunately the grave affairs which absorbed the Assembly, the prolonged agitations in Alsace, and the passions of the clerical party kept in check the active propaganda of the Jews and their friends. A few days before the dissolution of the National Assembly (27 September 1791) a member of the Jacobin Club, formerly a parliamentary councilor, Duport, unexpectedly ascended the tribune and said,<blockquote>I believe that freedom of worship does not permit any distinction in the political rights of citizens on account of their creed. The question of the political existence of the Jews has been postponed. Still the Muslems and the men of all sects are admitted to enjoy political rights in France. I demand that the motion for postponement be withdrawn, and a decree passed that the Jews in France enjoy the privileges of full citizens.</blockquote>This proposition was accepted amid loud applause. Rewbell endeavored, indeed, to oppose the motion, but he was interrupted by Regnault de Saint-Jean, president of the Assembly, who suggested \"that every one who spoke against this motion should be called to order, because he would be opposing the constitution itself\".\n\n===During the Reign of Terror===\nJudaism in France thus became, as the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] deputy Schwendt wrote to his constituents, \"nothing more than the name of a distinct religion\". However, in Alsace, especially in the [[Bas-Rhin]] the reactionaries did not cease their agitations and Jews were victims of discriminations.<ref name=bpr11 /> During the [[Reign of Terror]], at Bordeaux, Jewish bankers, compromised in the cause of the [[Girondists|Girondins]], had to pay important fines or to run away to save their lives while some Jewish bankers (49 according to the Jewish Encyclopedia) were imprisoned at Paris as suspects and nine of them were executed.<ref name=\"hjmedw11\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranee-antique.info/Moyen_Orient/Graetz/HJ_514.htm|title=Chapitre XIV \u2013 La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise et l'\u00e9mancipation des Juifs \u2014 (1789\u20131806).|last=Fournier|first=Fran\u00e7ois-Dominique|publisher=Histoire antique des pays et des hommes de la Mediterrann\u00e9e|work=Histoire des Juifs|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref> The decree of the convention by which the Catholic faith was annulled and replaced by the worship of Reason was applied by the provincial clubs, especially by those of the German districts, to the Jewish religion as well. Some synagogues were pillaged and the mayors of a few eastern towns (Strasbourg, Troyes, etc.) forbade the celebration of Sabbath (to apply the week of ten days).<ref name=hjmedw11 />\n\nMeanwhile, the French Jews gave proofs of their patriotism and of their gratitude to the land that had emancipated them. Many of them died in battle as part of the Army of the Republic while fighting the forces of Europe in coalition. To contribute to the war fund, candelabra of synagogues were sold, and wealthier Jews deprived themselves of their jewels to make similar contributions.\n\n===Attitude of Napoleon===\n{{Main|Napoleon and the Jews}}\n\n[[File:David Sintzheim, chef du grand Sanhedrin.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph David Sinzheim]] was the president of the [[Grand Sanhedrin]], an imperial Jewish high court sanctioned by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]].]]\n\n[[File:\u00c9douard Moyse Sermon dans un oratoire israelite 1897.jpg|thumb|''Sermon in an israelite oratory'' [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\n\nThough the Revolution had begun the process of [[Jewish emancipation]] in France, [[Napoleon]] also spread the concept in the lands he conquered across Europe, liberating Jews from their [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]] and establishing relative equality for them. The net effect of his policies significantly changed the position of the Jews in Europe. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures supporting the position of the Jews in the French Empire, including assembling a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the [[Grand Sanhedrin]]. In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to ghettos. In 1807, he added Judaism as an official religion of France, with previously sanctioned [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. Despite the positive effects, it is unclear however, whether Napoleon himself was disposed favorably towards the Jews, or merely saw them as a political or financial tool. On 17 March 1808, Napoleon rolled back some reforms by the so-called ''d\u00e9cret inf\u00e2me'', declaring all debts with Jews reduced, postponed, or annulled; this caused the Jewish community to nearly collapse. The decree also restricted where Jews could live, especially for those in the eastern [[First French Empire|French Empire]], with all its annexations in the [[Rhineland]] and beyond (as of 1810), in hopes of assimilating them into society. Many of these restrictions were eased again in 1811 and finally abolished in 1818.\n\n==After the Restoration==\nThe restoration of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] did not bring any change in the political condition of the Jews. Such of the enemies of the Jews as cherished the hope that the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] would hasten to undo the work of the Revolution with regard to Jewish emancipation were soon disappointed. The emancipation the French Jews had made such progress that the most clerical monarch could not find any pretext for curtailing their rights as citizens. They were no longer treated as poor, downtrodden peddlers{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} or money-lenders with whom every petty official could do as he liked. Many of them already occupied high positions in the army and the magistracy, as well as in the arts and sciences.\n\n===State recognition===\nOf the faiths recognized by the state, only Judaism had to support its ministers, while those of the Catholic and Protestant churches were supported by the government. This legal inferiority was removed in that year, thanks to the intervention of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and to the campaign led in Parliament by the deputies [[Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau|comte de Rambuteau]] and [[Jean-Pons-Guillaume Viennet|Jean Viennet]]. Encouraged by these prominent men, the minister of education, on 13 November 1830, offered a motion to place Judaism upon an equal footing with Catholicism and Protestantism as regards support for the synagogues and for the rabbis from the public treasury. The motion was accompanied by flattering compliments to the French Jews, \"who\", said the minister, \"since the removal of their [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] by the Revolution, have shown themselves worthy of the privileges granted them\". After a short discussion the motion was adopted by a large majority. In January 1831, it passed in the Chamber of Peers by 89 votes to 57, and on 8 February it was ratified by King Louis Philippe, who from the beginning had shown himself favorable to placing Judaism on an equal footing with the other faiths. Shortly afterward the rabbinical college, which had been founded at Metz in 1829, was recognized as a state institution, and was granted a subsidy. The government likewise liquidated the debts contracted by various Jewish communities before the Revolution.\n\n=== Full equality ===\nFull equality did not occur until 1831. By the fourth decade of the nineteenth century, France provided an environment in which Jews took active and many times leading roles. The Napoleonic policy of ''carri\u00e8res aux talents'' 'careers for the gifted' permitted French Jews to enter previously forbidden fields such as the arts, finance, trade, and government. For this they were never forgiven by primarily Royalist and Catholic antisemites.\n\n===Assimilation===\n[[File:Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux by Lecomte du Nouy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]], founder of the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] - [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme]]]]\nWhile the Jews had been placed in every point the equals of their Christian fellow citizens, the oath ''[[More Judaico]]'' still continued to be administered to them, in spite of the repeated protestations of the rabbis and the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistory]]. It was only in 1846, owing to a brilliant speech of the Jewish lawyer [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]], pronounced before the Court of N\u00eemes in defense of a rabbi who had refused to take this oath, and to a valuable essay on the subject by Martin, a prominent Christian advocate of Strasburg, that the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] removed this last remnant of the legislation of the Middle Ages. With this act of justice the history of the Jews of France merges into the general history of the French people. The rapidity with which many of them won affluence and distinction in the nineteenth century is without parallel. In spite of the deep-rooted prejudices which prevailed in certain classes of French society, many of them occupied high positions in literature, art, science, jurisprudence, the army\u2014indeed, in every walk of life.  In 1860, the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]] was formed \"to work everywhere for the emancipation and moral progress of the Jews; to offer effective assistance to Jews suffering from antisemitism; and to encourage all publications calculated to promote this aim.\" <ref name=\"Jewish Virtual Library 2019\">{{cite web | title=Alliance Israelite Universelle | website=Jewish Virtual Library | date=8 April 2019 | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00834.html | access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870 the approximately 40,000 Jews of [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], at that time a French ''d\u00e9partement'', were automatically granted [[French citizenship]] by the ''[[Cr\u00e9mieux Decree|Cr\u00e9mieux decrees]]'', contrary to their Muslim neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maitre-eolas.fr/2007/08/18/694-l-affaire-de-la-consonnance-isralite-du-nom-de-famille|title=L'affaire de la \"consonnance isra\u00e9lite\" du nom de famille|work=Journal d'un avocat|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nPeople of Jewish faith in France were becoming assimilated into their lives. After their Emancipation in 1791, Jews in France had new freedoms. For example, Jews were allowed to attend schools that were once delegated for just non-Jews. They were also allowed to pray in their own synagogues. Lastly, many Jews found themselves moving from the rural areas of France and into the big cities. In these big cities, Jews had new job opportunities and many were advancing up the economic ladder.\n\n[[File:1893 La-Libre-Parole-antisemitische-Karikatur.jpg|thumb|1893 edition of [[Edouard Drumont]]'s antisemitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''.]]\nAlthough life was looking brighter for these Western Jews, some Jews who lived in Eastern Europe believed that the Emancipation in Western countries were causing the Jews to lose their traditional beliefs and culture. As more and more Jews were becoming assimilated into their new lives, these Jews were breaking away from rabbinical law and rabbinical authority decreased. For example, Jews were marrying outside of their religion and their children were growing up in homes where they were not being introduced to traditional beliefs and losing connection with their roots. Also, in these new urbanized Jewish homes, less and less Jews were following the strict laws of Kosher laws. Many Jews were so preoccupied with assimilating and prospering in their new lives that they formed a new type of Judaism that would fit with the times. The Reform Movement came about to let Jews stay connected to their roots while also living their lives without so many restrictions.\n\n===Antisemitism===\n[[Alphonse Toussenel]] (1803-1885) was a political writer and zoologist who introduced antisemitism into French mainstream thinking.  A [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] and a disciple of [[Charles Fourier]]. He criticized the economic liberalism of the July Monarchy and denounced the ills of civilization: individualism, egoism, and class conflict.  He was hostile to the Jews and also to the British. Toussenel's  ''Les juifs rois de l'\u00e9poque, histoire de la f\u00e9odalit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re'' (1845) argued that French finance and commerce was controlled by an alien' Jewish presence, typified in the malign influence of the [[Rothschild banking family of France]].  Toussenel's antisemitism was rooted in a revolutionary-nationalist interpretation reading of French history. He was innovative and using zoology as a vehicle for social criticism, and his natural history books, as much as his political writings, were infused with antisemitic and anti-English sentiments. For Toussenel, the English and the Jews represented external and internal threats to French national identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crossley|first=Ceri|date=2004|title=Anglophobia and anti-Semitism: The case of Alphonse Toussenel (1803-1885)|journal=Modern & Contemporary France|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=459\u2013472|doi=10.1080/0963948042000284722|issn=0963-9489}}</ref>\n\nAntisemitism based on racism emerged in the 1880s led by  [[Edouard Drumont]], who founded the [[Antisemitic League of France]] in 1889, and was the founder and editor of the newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''.  After spending years of research, he synthesized three major strands of antisemitism. The first strand was traditional Catholic attitudes toward the \"Christ killers\" augmented by vehement antipathy toward the French Revolution. The second strand was hostility to capitalism, of the sort promoted by the Socialist movement. The third strand was scientific racism, based on the argument that races have fixed characteristics, and the Jews have highly negative characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism : a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|others=Levy, Richard S.|isbn=1851094393|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=58830958}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism during the French Second Empire|last=Isser|first=Natalie|date=1991|publisher=Lang|isbn=9780820414546|location=New York; Bern; Frankfurt am Main; Paris|pages=|language=English|oclc=243444805}}</ref>\n\n==Dreyfus affair==\n[[File:J\u2019accuse.jpg|thumb|Newspaper front page with [[\u00c9mile Zola]]'s letter, ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'' (I Accuse), addressing the President of the Republic, and accusing the government with antisemitism in the [[Dreyfus affair]].]]\n{{main|Dreyfus affair}}\nThe ''Dreyfus affair'' was a major political scandal that convulsed France from 1894 until its resolution in 1906, and then had reverberations for decades more.

The issue was blatant antisemitism as practiced by the Army and defended by traditionalists (especially Catholics) against secular and republican forces, including most Jews. In the end the latter triumphed.<ref>Piers Paul Read, ''The Dreyfus Affair'' (2012)</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Stephen|date=1976|title=Antisemitism and Jewish Response in France during the Dreyfus Affair|journal=European Studies Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=225\u2013248|doi=10.1177/026569147600600203|issn=0014-3111}}</ref>\n\nThe affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a young French artillery officer of [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish descent]]. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly having communicated French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris, Dreyfus was sent to the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]], where he spent almost five years.\n\nTwo years later, in 1896, evidence came to light identifying a French Army major named [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]] as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after the second day of his trial. The Army accused Dreyfus of additional charges based on false documents. Word of the military court's framing of Dreyfus and of an attendant cover-up began to spread, chiefly owing to ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'', a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Activists put pressure on the government to reopen the case.\n\nIn 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \"Dreyfusards\"), such as [[Anatole France]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as [[\u00c9douard Drumont]], the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against Alfred Dreyfus were demonstrated to be baseless. In 1906 Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the French Army.\n\nThe Affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army, mostly Catholic \"anti-Dreyfusards\" who generally lost the initiative to the anticlerical, pro-republican Dreyfusards. It embittered French politics and allowed the radicals to come to power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315842639|title=The Dreyfus Affair in French Society and Politics|year=2014|last=Cahm|first=Eric|isbn=9781315842639|location=Oxfordshire, England|oclc=889266445}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=France and the Dreyfus Affair: A Documentary History|last=Burns|first=Michael|date=1999|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|isbn=0312111673|location=Boston|oclc=40593627}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nThe relatively small Jewish community was based in Paris, and very well established in the city's business, financial, and intellectual elite. A third of Parisian bankers were Jewish, led by the [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschild family]], which also played a dominant role in the well organized Jewish community. Many of the most influential French intellectuals were nominally Jewish, including [[Henri Bergson]], [[Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl]] and  [[Emile Durkheim]]. The Dreyfus affair to some degree rekindled their sense of being Jewish.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=Pierre|date=1995|title=French Jewish Sociologists Between Reason and Faith: The Impact of the Dreyfus Affair|journal=Jewish Social Studies|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201335|issn=0021-6704|jstor=4467459}}</ref> Jews were prominent in art and culture, typified by such artists as [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]], [[Soutine]], and [[Chagall]].

The antisemitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]'' closed in 1924, and the former anti-Dreyfusard [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] included Jews among France's \"spiritual families\".  However it soared during the 1930s.<ref>Hyman, ''From Dreyfus to Vichy : the remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939'' pp 54-57, 199-202.</ref>\n\nAfter 1900, a wave of Jewish immigrants arrived, mostly fleeing the [[pogroms]] of Eastern Europe. The flow temporarily halted during World War I but resumed afterwards. The long-established, heavily assimilated Jewish population by 1920 was now only a third of the French Jewish population. It was overwhelmed by new immigrants and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine. About 200,000 immigrants arrived, 1900 to 1939, mostly Yiddish-speakers from Russia and Poland as well as German-speaking Jews who fled the Nazi regime after 1933. The historic base of traditional Judaism was in Alsace-Lorraine, which was recovered by France in 1918.\n\nThe new arrivals got along poorly with the established elite Jewish community. They did not want to assimilate, and they vigorously supported such new causes, especially Zionism and communism.<ref>Hyman, ''From Dreyfus to Vichy: The Remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939'' (1979) pp 63-88.</ref>  The Yiddish influx and the Jewishness of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]'s leader [[L\u00e9on Blum]] contributed to a revival of antisemitism in the 1930s. Conservative writers such as [[Paul Morand]], [[Pierre Gaxotte]], [[Marcel Jouhandeau]], and the leader of  ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' [[Charles Maurras]] denounced Jews. Perhaps the most violent antisemitic writer was [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]], who wrote, \"I feel myself very friendly to Hitler, and to all Germans, whom I feel to be my brothers.... Our real enemies are Jews and Masons\", and \"Yids are like bedbugs.\"\n\nBy 1937, even mainstream French conservatives and socialists, not previously associated with antisemitism, denounced the alleged Jewish influence pushing the country into a \"Jewish war\" against Nazi Germany. The new intensity of antisemitism facilitated the extremism of the Vichy regime after 1940.<ref>{{cite book|author=Julian Jackson|title=France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtLSly2RN2wC&pg=PT184|year=2003|pages=184\u201386|isbn=9780191622885}}</ref>\n\n===World War II and the Holocaust===\n{{main|The Holocaust in France}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0211-500, Frankreich, Antisemitismus, Ausstellung.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antisemitic Exposition during Nazi occupation of France (1942).]]\nWhen [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|France came under occupation by Nazi Germany]] in June 1940, there were about 330,000 Jews living in France (and 370 000 in French North Africa). Of the 330,000, fewer than half held French citizenship. The others were foreigners, mostly exiles from Germany and Central Europe who had immigrated to France during the 1930s.<ref name=USHMM>{{cite web|title=France|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005429|work=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]}}</ref> Another 110,000 French Jews were living in the colony of French Algeria.<ref name=HDJEF>{{cite book|last=Blumenkranz|first=Bernhard|title=Histoire des Juifs en France|date=1972|publisher=Privat|location=Toulouse|pages=376}}</ref>\n\nAbout 200,000 Jews, and the large majority of foreign Jews, resided in the Paris area. Among the 150,000 French Jews, about 30,000, generally native to Central Europe, had obtained French citizenship after immigrating to France during the 1930s. Following the 1940 armistice after Germany occupied France, the Nazis incorporated the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine into Germany. The remainder of northern and western France was placed under German military control. Unoccupied southern metropolitan France and the French empire were placed under the control of the [[Vichy Regime]], a new collaborationist French government. Some Jews managed to escape the invading German forces. Some found refuge in the countryside. Spain allowed 25,600 Jews to use its territory as an escape route.\n\nGerman occupation forces published their first anti-Jewish measure on 27 September 1940 as the \"First Ordinance.\" The measure was a census of Jews, and defined \"[[who is a Jew]].\" The Second Ordinance was published on 18 October 1940, proscribing various business activities for Jews. On 31 August 1941 German forces confiscated all radios belonging to Jews, followed by their telephones, their bicycles, and disconnecting all phones to Jews. They were forbidden to use public telephones. Jews were forbidden to change their address, and next were forbidden to leave their homes between 8 pm and 5 am. All public places, parks, theatres and certain shops were soon closed to Jews. German forces issued new restrictions, prohibitions and decrees by the week. Jews were barred from public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts, music halls, etc. On the metro, they were allowed to ride only in the last carriage. Antisemitic articles were frequently published in newspapers since the Occupation. The Germans organized antisemitic exhibitions to spread their propaganda. The music of Jewish composers was banned, as were works of art by Jewish artists. On 2 October 1941, seven synagogues were bombed.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DrancyConcentrationCamp.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Drancy internment camp|internment camp at Drancy]], outside Paris, where Jews were confined until they were deported to the [[death camps]].]] -->\nThe first roundup of Jews took place on 14 May 1941, and 4,000 foreign Jews were taken captive. Another roundup took place on 20 August 1941, collecting both French and foreign Jews, who were sent to the [[Drancy internment camp]] and other [[concentration camps in France]]. Roundups continued, collecting French nationals, including  lawyers and other professionals. On 12 December 1941, the most distinguished members of the Paris Jewish community, including doctors, academics, scientists and writers, were rounded up. On 29 May 1942, the Eighth Ordinance was published, which ordered Jews to wear the [[Yellow badge#Nazi Europe|yellow star]]. The most notorious roundup was the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]], which required detailed planning and the use of the full resources of French police forces. This roundup took place on 16 and 17 July 1942; it collected nearly 13,000 Jews, 7,000 of whom, including more than 4,000 children, were interned and locked into the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver, without adequate food or sanitation.\n\nIn the meantime, the Germans began deportations of Jews from France to the death camps in eastern Europe. The first trains left on 27 March 1942. Deportations continued until 17 August 1944, by which time nearly 76,000 Jews (including those from Vichy France) were deported, of whom only 2,500 survived. (see [[Timeline of deportations of French Jews to death camps]].) The majority of Jews deported were non-French Jews.<ref name=USHMM/> One quarter of the pre-war Jewish population of France was killed in that process.\n\nAntisemitism was particularly virulent in Vichy France, which controlled a third of France fr\nom 1940 to 42, when the Germans took over that southern area. Vichy's Jewish policy was a mixture of 1930s antiforeigner legislation with the virulent antisemitism of the Action Fran\u00e7aise movement.<ref>Jacques Adler,  \"The Jews and Vichy: reflections on French historiography.\" ''Historical Journal'' 44.4 (2001): 1065-1082.</ref> The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps. As early as October 1940, without any request from the Germans, the Vichy government passed anti-Jewish measures (the [[Vichy laws on the status of Jews]]), prohibiting them from moving, and limiting their access to public places and most professional activities, especially the practice of medicine. The Vichy government also implemented those anti-Jewish laws in the colonies of Vichy North Africa. In 1941, the Vichy government established a ''[[Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux questions juives (1941-1944)]],'' which in 1942 worked with the [[Gestapo]] to round-up Jews. They participated in the Vel' d'Hiv roundup on 16 and 17 July 1942.\n\nOn the other hand, France is recognised as the nation with the third highest number of [[Righteous Among the Nations]] (according to the [[Yad Vashem]] museum, 2006). This award is given to \"non-Jews who acted according to the most noble principles of humanity by risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.\"\n\nIn 1995 French President [[Jacques Chirac]] formally apologized to the Jewish community for the complicit role that French policemen and civil servants played in the roundups. He said:\n\n:\"These black hours will stain our history for ever and are an injury to our past and our traditions. Yes, the criminal madness of the occupant was assisted ('second\u00e9e') by the French, by the French state. Fifty-three years ago, on 16 July 1942, 4500 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders, obeyed the demands of the Nazis. That day, in the capital and the Paris region, nearly 10,000 Jewish men, women and children were arrested at home, in the early hours of the morning, and assembled at police stations...

Before World War II and the Holocaust, French Jews were predominately from the [[Ashkenazi]] tradition and culture. The Sephardim, who follow [[Nusach Sefard|nusach sepharad]] (Judaism as per the Sephardic ritual, according to Dan Michman's definition of such Jews), have since had a significant influence on the nature of French Jewish culture. These Jews from French North Africa have generally enjoyed a successful social and economic integration and helped reinvigorate the country's Jewish community. [[Kosher]] restaurants and Jewish schools have multiplied, in particular since the 1980s. In part in response to internal and international events, many of the younger generations have committed to religious renewal.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the [[1980 Paris synagogue bombing]], France's Jewish population suffered its first deadly [[terrorist]] attack since actions of the German occupation in the Second World War.

It is expected to have 20 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020, though it currently stands as 9th in the world in terms of nuclear capacity.\n\nAn Achilles' heel of the Indian nuclear power programme, however, is the fact that India is not a signatory of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. This has many times in its history prevented it from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding its nuclear industry. Another consequence of this is that much of its programme has been domestically developed much like its nuclear weapons programme. The [[United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act]] seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.\n\n{{further information|India's three-stage nuclear power programme}}\nIndia has been using imported enriched uranium and is under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy-water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment. India has also done a great amount of work in the development of a [[India's three stage nuclear power programme|thorium-centred fuel cycle]]. While uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of thorium, and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A prototype reactor that would burn uranium-plutonium fuel while irradiating a thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.\n\nUranium used for the weapons programme has been separate from the power programme using uranium from scant indigenous reserves.\n\n==Hydro electricity==\n{{See also|Hydroelectric power in India}}\nIndia is endowed with economically exploitable and viable hydro potential assessed to be about 125,570 MW at 60% [[capacity factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WEResources_Hydropower_2016.pdf  |title=World Energy Resources Hydro Power, 2016 |publisher= World Energy Council|accessdate=30 November 2017 }}</ref> India ranked fourth globally by underutilized hydro power potential.

It is expected to have 20 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020, though it currently stands as 9th in the world in terms of nuclear capacity.\n\nAn Achilles' heel of the Indian nuclear power programme, however, is the fact that India is not a signatory of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. This has many times in its history prevented it from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding its nuclear industry. Another consequence of this is that much of its programme has been domestically developed much like its nuclear weapons programme. The [[United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act]] seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.\n\n{{further information|India's three-stage nuclear power programme}}\nIndia has been using imported enriched uranium and is under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy-water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment. India has also done a great amount of work in the development of a [[India's three stage nuclear power programme|thorium-centred fuel cycle]]. While uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of thorium, and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A prototype reactor that would burn uranium-plutonium fuel while irradiating a thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.\n\nUranium used for the weapons programme has been separate from the power programme using uranium from scant indigenous reserves.\n\n==Hydro electricity==\n{{See also|Hydroelectric power in India}}\nIndia is endowed with economically exploitable and viable hydro potential assessed to be about 125,570 MW at 60% [[capacity factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WEResources_Hydropower_2016.pdf  |title=World Energy Resources Hydro Power, 2016 |publisher= World Energy Council|accessdate=30 November 2017 }}</ref> India ranked fourth globally by underutilized hydro power potential.

The song was used in her 2002 movie ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', in which Spears' character Lucy performs it in a karaoke bar. Spears said of the song, \"They asked me to sing karaoke in the movie ''Crossroads'' and I've actually sung I Love Rock 'n' Roll in a lot of clubs that I've been to.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dingwall|first=John|title=OTR..Off the Record: Your Time Is Up, Jacko; Britney Wants Album Top Slot|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Scotland|date=5 November 2001|page=19|url=}}</ref> Spears has publicly stated that the original song is one of her favorites. She listened to the original Arrows Mickie Most-produced version just before she recorded the song, according to [[Jive Records|Jive]] A&R representative Steve Lunt. The scratches performed on this version were performed by Corey Chase at Hit Factory Miami. When promoting the single's release, Spears mistakenly attributed the hit version of the song to [[Pat Benatar]] instead of Joan Jett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|title=What Britney said, or should have|author=Jim DeRogatis|date=4 November 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116135611/http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|archivedate=16 November 2001|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=26 February 2012|author-link=Jim DeRogatis}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical====\nSpears' cover was met with mostly favorable reviews.

The song was moderately successful in the UK, where it peaked at #13 (which, at the time, was Spears' lowest peak for a single released there, until \"[[Radar (song)|Radar]]\" only managed to reach #46 in 2009, and then \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", which peaked at #111).

The video begins in [[black and white]] and switches to and from color throughout. It was shot at The Inn, a bar in Long Beach, New York. The video was ranked at #2 on the 100 Best Videos of 2002 list during [[MTV Latin America]]'s countdown. A \"Director's Cut\" version of the video was later leaked, containing previously unseen scenes.\n\nThe song was performed live during Spears' [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] (2001\u201302). In 2016, it was added to the revamped set list of her [[Las Vegas]] residency show, [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2016\u201317), marking the first time Spears performed the song in 14 years. During the performance, Britney Spears rode a mechanical electric guitar, which simulated a mechanical bull, as it rotated on stage. The same prop electric guitar had been used during her [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011) for a segment in which she covered the song \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. At the [[2016 Billboard Music Awards]], the song was performed as part of a medley.\n\n===Track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;European 2 tracks CD single\n# \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" (Album

He said, \"We were blown away by the support we received on our Christmas Number 1 single last year and how far that money has gone into changing the lives of families living in poverty across the UK. We're continually looking for ways we can support food bank charity the Trussell Trust further as the size of the problem still facing so many adults (and children) is huge and we ALL need to do whatever we can to say goodbye to poverty once and for all in the UK!

It was also the fastest-selling download since Artists for Grenfell version of \"[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]\" in June 2017. LadBaby became the third act to have two consecutive Christmas number one singles and the first to have two successive novelty Christmas number ones in the UK.

The song was used in her 2002 movie ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', in which Spears' character Lucy performs it in a karaoke bar. Spears said of the song, \"They asked me to sing karaoke in the movie ''Crossroads'' and I've actually sung I Love Rock 'n' Roll in a lot of clubs that I've been to.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dingwall|first=John|title=OTR..Off the Record: Your Time Is Up, Jacko; Britney Wants Album Top Slot|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Scotland|date=5 November 2001|page=19|url=}}</ref> Spears has publicly stated that the original song is one of her favorites. She listened to the original Arrows Mickie Most-produced version just before she recorded the song, according to [[Jive Records|Jive]] A&R representative Steve Lunt. The scratches performed on this version were performed by Corey Chase at Hit Factory Miami. When promoting the single's release, Spears mistakenly attributed the hit version of the song to [[Pat Benatar]] instead of Joan Jett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|title=What Britney said, or should have|author=Jim DeRogatis|date=4 November 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116135611/http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|archivedate=16 November 2001|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=26 February 2012|author-link=Jim DeRogatis}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical====\nSpears' cover was met with mostly favorable reviews.

The song was moderately successful in the UK, where it peaked at #13 (which, at the time, was Spears' lowest peak for a single released there, until \"[[Radar (song)|Radar]]\" only managed to reach #46 in 2009, and then \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", which peaked at #111).

The video begins in [[black and white]] and switches to and from color throughout. It was shot at The Inn, a bar in Long Beach, New York. The video was ranked at #2 on the 100 Best Videos of 2002 list during [[MTV Latin America]]'s countdown. A \"Director's Cut\" version of the video was later leaked, containing previously unseen scenes.\n\nThe song was performed live during Spears' [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] (2001\u201302). In 2016, it was added to the revamped set list of her [[Las Vegas]] residency show, [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2016\u201317), marking the first time Spears performed the song in 14 years. During the performance, Britney Spears rode a mechanical electric guitar, which simulated a mechanical bull, as it rotated on stage. The same prop electric guitar had been used during her [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011) for a segment in which she covered the song \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. At the [[2016 Billboard Music Awards]], the song was performed as part of a medley.\n\n===Track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;European 2 tracks CD single\n# \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" (Album

It was also the fastest-selling download since Artists for Grenfell version of \"[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]\" in June 2017. LadBaby became the third act to have two consecutive Christmas number one singles and the first to have two successive novelty Christmas number ones in the UK.

Newton Harvey]], the world leader of luminescence studies at the time, and focused on the role of oxygen in the luminescence of bacteria, fireflies, ostracod crustaceans and fungi. He received his PhD in 1951.<ref name=\"thesis-hastings-1951\">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302031068/ |title=Oxygen concentration and bioluminescence intensity |date=1951 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Hastings |first=John W. |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=80712719}}</ref> He then joined the lab of [[William D. McElroy]], another student of Harvey\u2019s, at [[Johns Hopkins University]] where he discovered both the stimulatory effects of [[coenzyme A]] and gating control by [[oxygen]] of firefly luminescence, and that [[Flavin group|flavin]] is a substrate in bacterial luminescence.\n\nIn 1953 he joined the faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences at [[Northwestern University]]. In 1954 he began a long collaboration with [[Beatrice M. Sweeney]], who was then at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], in elucidating the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of luminescence in the unicellular dinoflagellate ''[[Lingulodinium polyedrum]]'' (formerly known as ''Gonyaulax polyedra''). A byproduct of this initial research was their discovery of circadian control of the luminescence.\n\nIn 1957, Hastings next took a faculty position in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] where he continued his focus on dinoflagellate and bacterial luminescence and dinoflagellate circadian rhythms. Hastings joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]] as Professor of Biology in 1966. During this period he continued and expanded his studies of circadian rhythms in dinoflagellates and luminescence in bacteria, dinoflagellates and other organisms. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003<ref name=\"Pnas.org\" /> and received the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine for his work on circadian rhythms in 2006.<ref name=\"SleepMed\" /><ref>[http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Hastings.html Dept of MCB, Harvard U: News and Events - MCB News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030090134/http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Hastings.html |date=October 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nFor over 50 years he also had an affiliation with the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He was the director of the [[Physiology]] Course there from 1962\u20131966, and served as a trustee from 1966\u20131970.\n\n==Research Interests <ref name=\"Pnas.org\" />==\n\n'''Luminescent Bacteria''': Hastings{{'}} investigations of luminous bacteria acted as a catalyst for the discoveries of the biochemical mechanisms involved in their light production,<ref>Nealson, K., Platt, T. and Hastings, J.W. (1970)</ref> the discovery of a flavin to be a substrate in its [[luciferase]] reaction,<ref>Hastings, J.W. and Gibson, Q.H. (1963)</ref> the determination of [[gene]] regulation of the luciferases, and the first evidence for [[quorum sensing]],<ref>Nealson, K., Platt, T. and Hastings, J.W. (1970), Hastings, J.W. and Greenberg, E.P. (1999)</ref> a form of bacterial communication. In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release a substance into the medium, the autoinducer. Once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level (a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area), [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in [[gram-negative bacteria]] quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. It is now known that in many [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, there is delayed production of [[toxins]], which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity, this is similar to what happens for luciferase proteins. By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial, these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defences of the host.\n\n'''Luminescent Dinoflagellates''': In early 1954 at [[Northwestern University]], Hastings, his students and colleagues studied [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[molecular]] aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [especially ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' (formerly ''Gonyaulax polyedra'')]. They elucidated the structures of the [[luciferin]]s and [[luciferases]],<ref>Hastings, J.W. and Sweeney, B.M. (1957), Sweeney, B.M. and Hastings, J.W. (1957)</ref> the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms,<ref>Fogel, M. and Hastings, J.W. (1972), McMurry, L. and Hastings, J.W. (1972)</ref> and the actual sub-cellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed [[scintillons]].<ref>DeSa, R.J., Hastings, J.W. and Vatter, A.E. (1963), Nicolas, M-T., Nicolas, G., Johnson, C.H., Bassot, J-M. and Hastings, J.W. (1987)</ref> They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in [[pH]] when an [[action potential]] leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons.<ref>Krieger, N. and Hastings, J.W. (1968)</ref> Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 \u03bcm) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein.<ref>Nicolas, M-T., Nicolas, G., Johnson, C.H., Bassot, J-M. and Hastings, J.W. (1987)</ref> More recently, the lab found that the luciferase gene in ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences in a kind of \"three-ring circus with the same act in all three.\"<ref>Liu, L., Wilson, T. and Hastings, J.W. (2004)</ref> However, another luminescent, but [[heterotrophic]], dinoflagellate, ''[[Noctiluca scintillans]]'', has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.\n\n'''Dinoflagellate Circadian Rhythms''': Using ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' as a model, Hastings spearheaded our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in control of circadian rhythms,<ref>Bode, V.C., DeSa, R.J. and Hastings, J.W. (1963), McMurry, L. and Hastings, J.W. (1972)</ref> which in humans are involved in sleep, jet-lag and other daily activities. His lab has shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins.<ref>Dunlap, J. and Hastings, J.W. (1981)</ref> Because the [[mRNA]]s that code for these proteins remain unchanged from day to night, the synthesis of these proteins is controlled at the [[translational]] level.<ref>Morse, D., Milos, P.M., Roux, E., and Hastings, J.W. (1989), Hastings, J.W. (2007)</ref> This work has now been expanded to other proteins in the cell. On the other hand, short pulses of inhibitors of synthesis of these proteins results in phase shifts of the circadian rhythm, either delays or advances, depending when the pulse is administered.<ref>Taylor, W.R., Dunlap, J.C., Hastings, J.W. (1982)</ref> At still another level, [[protein phosphorylation]] inhibitors also influence the period of the rhythm.<ref>Comolli, J. and Hastings J. W. (1999)</ref>\n\n'''Other luminescent systems''': Early in his career Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of [[oxygen]] required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans.<ref>Hastings, J.W. (1952a, 1952b)</ref> This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing.<ref>Hastings, J.W., McElroy, W.D. and Coulombre, J. (1953)</ref> In other work when he was in the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission.<ref>McElroy, W.D., Hastings, J.W., Sonnenfeld, V. and Coulombre, J. (1953)</ref> His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule ([[aequorin]]), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP).<ref name=\"Morin, J.G 1971\"/> Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns.<ref name=\"Hastings, J.W 2006\"/> [[Osamu Shimomura]], [[Martin Chalfie]] and [[Roger Tsien]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.\n\n==Death==\nHastings died of [[pulmonary fibrosis]] on August 6, 2014 at [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"NYT-obit-hastings\">{{cite news|last1=Slotnik|first1=Daniel E.|title=J.

Newton Harvey]], the world leader of luminescence studies at the time, and focused on the role of oxygen in the luminescence of bacteria, fireflies, ostracod crustaceans and fungi. He received his PhD in 1951.<ref name=\"thesis-hastings-1951\">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302031068/ |title=Oxygen concentration and bioluminescence intensity |date=1951 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Hastings |first=John W. |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=80712719}}</ref> He then joined the lab of [[William D. McElroy]], another student of Harvey\u2019s, at [[Johns Hopkins University]] where he discovered both the stimulatory effects of [[coenzyme A]] and gating control by [[oxygen]] of firefly luminescence, and that [[Flavin group|flavin]] is a substrate in bacterial luminescence.\n\nIn 1953 he joined the faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences at [[Northwestern University]]. In 1954 he began a long collaboration with [[Beatrice M. Sweeney]], who was then at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], in elucidating the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of luminescence in the unicellular dinoflagellate ''[[Lingulodinium polyedrum]]'' (formerly known as ''Gonyaulax polyedra''). A byproduct of this initial research was their discovery of circadian control of the luminescence.\n\nIn 1957, Hastings next took a faculty position in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] where he continued his focus on dinoflagellate and bacterial luminescence and dinoflagellate circadian rhythms. Hastings joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]] as Professor of Biology in 1966. During this period he continued and expanded his studies of circadian rhythms in dinoflagellates and luminescence in bacteria, dinoflagellates and other organisms. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003<ref name=\"Pnas.org\" /> and received the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine for his work on circadian rhythms in 2006.<ref name=\"SleepMed\" /><ref>[http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Hastings.html Dept of MCB, Harvard U: News and Events - MCB News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030090134/http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Hastings.html |date=October 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nFor over 50 years he also had an affiliation with the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He was the director of the [[Physiology]] Course there from 1962\u20131966, and served as a trustee from 1966\u20131970.\n\n==Research Interests <ref name=\"Pnas.org\" />==\n\n'''Luminescent Bacteria''': Hastings{{'}} investigations of luminous bacteria acted as a catalyst for the discoveries of the biochemical mechanisms involved in their light production,<ref>Nealson, K., Platt, T. and Hastings, J.W. (1970)</ref> the discovery of a flavin to be a substrate in its [[luciferase]] reaction,<ref>Hastings, J.W. and Gibson, Q.H. (1963)</ref> the determination of [[gene]] regulation of the luciferases, and the first evidence for [[quorum sensing]],<ref>Nealson, K., Platt, T. and Hastings, J.W. (1970), Hastings, J.W. and Greenberg, E.P. (1999)</ref> a form of bacterial communication. In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release a substance into the medium, the autoinducer. Once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level (a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area), [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in [[gram-negative bacteria]] quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. It is now known that in many [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, there is delayed production of [[toxins]], which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity, this is similar to what happens for luciferase proteins. By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial, these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defences of the host.\n\n'''Luminescent Dinoflagellates''': In early 1954 at [[Northwestern University]], Hastings, his students and colleagues studied [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[molecular]] aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [especially ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' (formerly ''Gonyaulax polyedra'')]. They elucidated the structures of the [[luciferin]]s and [[luciferases]],<ref>Hastings, J.W. and Sweeney, B.M. (1957), Sweeney, B.M. and Hastings, J.W. (1957)</ref> the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms,<ref>Fogel, M. and Hastings, J.W. (1972), McMurry, L. and Hastings, J.W. (1972)</ref> and the actual sub-cellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed [[scintillons]].<ref>DeSa, R.J., Hastings, J.W. and Vatter, A.E. (1963), Nicolas, M-T., Nicolas, G., Johnson, C.H., Bassot, J-M. and Hastings, J.W. (1987)</ref> They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in [[pH]] when an [[action potential]] leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons.<ref>Krieger, N. and Hastings, J.W. (1968)</ref> Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 \u03bcm) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein.<ref>Nicolas, M-T., Nicolas, G., Johnson, C.H., Bassot, J-M. and Hastings, J.W. (1987)</ref> More recently, the lab found that the luciferase gene in ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences in a kind of \"three-ring circus with the same act in all three.\"<ref>Liu, L., Wilson, T. and Hastings, J.W. (2004)</ref> However, another luminescent, but [[heterotrophic]], dinoflagellate, ''[[Noctiluca scintillans]]'', has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.\n\n'''Dinoflagellate Circadian Rhythms''': Using ''Lingulodinium polyedrum'' as a model, Hastings spearheaded our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in control of circadian rhythms,<ref>Bode, V.C., DeSa, R.J. and Hastings, J.W. (1963), McMurry, L. and Hastings, J.W. (1972)</ref> which in humans are involved in sleep, jet-lag and other daily activities. His lab has shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins.<ref>Dunlap, J. and Hastings, J.W. (1981)</ref> Because the [[mRNA]]s that code for these proteins remain unchanged from day to night, the synthesis of these proteins is controlled at the [[translational]] level.<ref>Morse, D., Milos, P.M., Roux, E., and Hastings, J.W. (1989), Hastings, J.W. (2007)</ref> This work has now been expanded to other proteins in the cell. On the other hand, short pulses of inhibitors of synthesis of these proteins results in phase shifts of the circadian rhythm, either delays or advances, depending when the pulse is administered.<ref>Taylor, W.R., Dunlap, J.C., Hastings, J.W. (1982)</ref> At still another level, [[protein phosphorylation]] inhibitors also influence the period of the rhythm.<ref>Comolli, J. and Hastings J. W. (1999)</ref>\n\n'''Other luminescent systems''': Early in his career Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of [[oxygen]] required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans.<ref>Hastings, J.W. (1952a, 1952b)</ref> This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing.<ref>Hastings, J.W., McElroy, W.D. and Coulombre, J. (1953)</ref> In other work when he was in the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission.<ref>McElroy, W.D., Hastings, J.W., Sonnenfeld, V. and Coulombre, J. (1953)</ref> His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule ([[aequorin]]), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP).<ref name=\"Morin, J.G 1971\"/> Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns.<ref name=\"Hastings, J.W 2006\"/> [[Osamu Shimomura]], [[Martin Chalfie]] and [[Roger Tsien]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.\n\n==Death==\nHastings died of [[pulmonary fibrosis]] on August 6, 2014 at [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"NYT-obit-hastings\">{{cite news|last1=Slotnik|first1=Daniel E.|title=J.

{"title_page": "Powers of the President of Singapore", "text_new": "[[File:Istana-Singapore-20090127.jpg|thumb|The [[Istana (Singapore)|Istana]], the official residence of the [[President of Singapore]], photographed in January 2009]]\nThe '''powers of the President of Singapore''' are divided into those which the largely ceremonial [[President of Singapore|President]] may exercise at his own discretion, and those he must exercise in accordance with the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] of [[Singapore]] or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. In addition, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) when performing some of his functions. In other cases, he may consult the CPA if he wishes to but is not bound to do so.\n\nIn 1991 the [[Constitution of Singapore]] was amended to transform the office of President, which was previously [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] by [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]], into an office [[direct election|directly elected]] by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts by the [[Government of Singapore|government]] of the day to draw down past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified [[Government of Singapore#Statutory boards|statutory boards]] and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the [[Central Provident Fund Board]] to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.\n\nThe President is also empowered to approve changes to key [[Singapore Civil Service|civil service]] positions, such as the [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]], the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]], the chairman and members of the [[Public Service Commission (Singapore)|Public Service Commission]], the Chief of Defence Force and the [[Commissioner of Police (Singapore)|Commissioner of Police]]. He also appoints as [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] a [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) who, in his personal judgment, is likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The President has certain powers of oversight over the [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] and decisions of the Executive under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] and the [[Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act]].\n\nThe term of office of the first popularly elected President, [[Ong Teng Cheong]] (1993\u20131999), was marked by differences between him and the Government concerning the extent of his discretionary fiscal powers. Discussions culminated in the Government issuing a non-binding [[white paper#Government white papers|white paper]] entitled ''The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies'' (1999). In 2009, the Government requested approval from President [[S. R. Nathan]] to draw [[Singapore dollar|S$]]4.9 billion from past financial reserves to meet current budget expenditure, the first time it had done so. The sum was used to fund the Government's Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial downturn]].\n\nWhether the President may speak publicly on issues without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the [[2011 Singaporean presidential election|2011 presidential election]]. While some candidates and members of the public suggested that the President has power to do so, the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Law Minister]], [[K. Shanmugam|K.&nbsp;Shanmugam]], stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. A difference of opinion also exists over whether the President exercises [[soft power]].\n\n==Grant of powers to the President==\n[[File:Halimah Yacob APEC Women and the Economy Forum 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Halimah Yacob]] in June 2012. She is the current [[President of Singapore]].]]\n\nBefore 1991, the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] of [[Singapore]]<ref>Now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|ed=1985|rep=1999}}.</ref> contained no provisions preventing the [[Government of Singapore|Government]] from funding spending from sovereign reserves. There were also no safeguards against the Government appointing unsuitable persons to important [[Singapore Civil Service|civil service]] positions. The Government concluded that a constitutional safeguard was necessary to preserve both the integrity of the public service, as well as Singapore's reserves which should be prevented from falling into the hands of a future irresponsible government.<ref>{{citation|title=Constitutional Amendments to Safeguard Financial Assets and the Integrity of the Public Services &#91;Cmd. 10 of 1988&#93;|location=Singapore|publisher=Printed for the [[Government of Singapore]] by Singapore National Printers|year=1988|oclc=83381201|title-link=Command paper}} (\"1988 White Paper\"); {{citation|author=Kevin Y L Tan|author2=Thio Li-ann|author2-link=Thio Li-ann|title=Constitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore|edition=3rd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|year=2010|pages=420\u2013426|isbn=978-981-236-795-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe Government took the view that the safeguards could be achieved by providing the [[direct election]] of the President,<ref>Prior to 1991, the President was [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] by [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]]: {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|abbr=on|rep=1980|lk=off}}, Art. 17(1).</ref> thus making the President directly accountable to the people, and enabling him to serve as a check against the Government by increasing his discretionary powers.

As of 2007, almost one-third of all the constitutional amendments since Singapore became [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|independent]] in 1965 consisted of changes to the President's office. Approximately half of the amendments implemented were to alter the President's fiscal powers.<ref>{{citation|author=Yvonne C[hing] L[ing] Lee|title=Under Lock and Key: The Evolving Role of the Elected President as a Fiscal Guardian|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=292568635719287;res=IELHSS|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|date=December 2007|pages=290\u2013322 at 291|ssrn=1139305}}.</ref>\n\n==Powers==\n{{anchor|Powers}}<!-- [[Council of Presidential Advisers]] redirects here -->The powers of the President are divided into those he may exercise in his own discretion, and those he must exercise in accordance with the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] or of a [[Cabinet of Singapore#Appointment of Cabinet|Minister]] acting under the general authority of the Cabinet.<ref>Constitution, Arts. 21(1) and (2).</ref> In addition, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) when performing some of his functions.

The [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], photographed here in September 2009, is one such statutory board.]]\n\nAs the fiscal guardian for the nation's past reserves (that is, reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office), the President's concurrence is required for a number of financial transactions that the Government may wish to enter into. A guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, whether the transaction is authorized by a [[resolution (law)|resolution]] of Parliament or is made under one of eight specified statutes.<ref>Constitution, Art. 144(1).</ref> The President's approval is also needed for budgets of specified [[Government of Singapore#Statutory boards|statutory boards]] and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The statutory boards that come under the President's purview are the [[Central Provident Fund Board]] (CPF Board), the [[Housing and Development Board]], [[JTC Corporation]] and the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], while the Government companies are the [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation|Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte.

If so, the President may exercise personal discretion to disapprove the budget. If he approves the budget even though he is of the opinion that the budget is likely to draw upon past reserves, the decision and opinion must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. Similarly, statutory boards and Government companies are bound to inform the President of financial transactions that are likely to draw on past reserves, and the President has personal discretion as to whether such transactions should be approved.<ref>Constitution, Arts. 21(2)(e), 21(2)(f), 22B and 22D.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the President possesses personal discretion to withhold his assent to any [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for:\n\n*the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the CPF Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and<ref>Constitution, Art. 22E.</ref>\n*the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office.<ref>Constitution, Art. 144(2).</ref>\n\nThe President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.

In 1994, the Constitution was amended to allow statutory boards and Government companies to transfer their reserves to the Government, provided that the Minister for Finance gave a written [[wikt:undertaking#Noun|undertaking]] that these sums would be added to past reserves.

The Constitution was amended in 2001 to state that all the NII in a financial year certified by the Government to be derived from its current reserves (that is, reserves accumulated by the Government during its current term of office) returns to current reserves. If no certification is made, at least 50% of the NII of the financial year derived from past reserves has to be classified as past reserves. These changes, however, do not apply to the NII earned by specified statutory boards and Government companies. Their NII is considered as part of normal income and is excluded from the President's scrutiny.<ref>Constitution, Art. 142(2), as amended by the {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment)|no=2|year=2001|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=e2356c89-2ef3-4242-9c64-a20ee0fadb8f;page=0;query=DocId%3Ab880feec-0701-45ab-abd3-d6e3449e27b5%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A07%2F02%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A07%2F02%2F2001%20Status%3Apublished;rec=0}}.</ref>\n\n====Differences between Government and first directly elected President====\n[[File:GohChokTong-WashingtonDC-20010614.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]] in June 2001]]\n\nOn 2 September 1993, [[Ong Teng Cheong]] became Singapore's first directly elected President. During his term of office, some differences arose between him and the Government concerning the extent of his discretionary fiscal powers. At a press conference on 16 July 1999, the President announced he would not be seeking re-election, and referred to what he termed a \"long list\" of problems he had experienced when trying to protect the nation's past reserves. In particular, he mentioned:\n\n*that the Accountant-General had informed him it would take 52 [[man-hour#Similar units|man-years]] to provide him with a list of the Government's physical assets;\n*an \"unpleasant\" encounter in which he had felt compelled to withhold approval of the budget of the [[Central Provident Fund Board]] (CPF Board) as it would have drawn on its past reserves;\n*a disagreement regarding whether net investment income (NII) should be treated as current or past reserves; and\n*his \"disappointment\" that the Government had changed its treatment of NII so as not to require him to approve the use of past reserves to finance its package of cost-cutting measures aimed at combating the effects of the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].<ref>{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Richard Hu Tsu Tau|mplink=Hu Tsu Tau Richard|office=[[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]]|title=Issues Raised by President Ong Teng Cheong at his Press Conference on 16th July 1999 (Statements by the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00067029-ZZ|date=17 August 1999|volume=70|column=2018}} (\"Ministerial Statement\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Hu Tsu Tau Richard|Richard Hu Tsu Tau]] and the Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] made ministerial statements in Parliament on 17 August 1999 explaining the Government's views on the points raised.\n\n;Access to information\nTo exercise his constitutional functions, the President is entitled to request information about the Government which is available to the Cabinet, and about the statutory boards and Government companies listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution which is available to the board's members or the company's directors. The President may also ask any Minister, senior officer of a ministry or a government department, CEO and members of the governing board of a statutory board, and directors of any Government company to furnish information concerning the reserves of the Government, a statutory board or a Government company.<ref>Constitution, Art. 22F.</ref> At a meeting with the Accountant-General in August 1996, the President, having been given a list of the Government's physical assets, had commented that the monetary value of the assets should have been stated. The Accountant-General had then stated it\nwould take 56 (not 52) man-years to value the properties.\n\nThe Minister for Finance explained that his Ministry had asked the Attorney-General to advise it as to whether such a valuation was necessary. The Attorney-General's Chambers subsequently stated that the Constitution did not require Government property to be revalued, as the issue of whether past reserves were being drawn upon did not arise unless ownership of a piece of property was about to be transferred. In addition, a revaluation would lead to unnecessary expense since much state land would remain as such, and the value of each piece of land depended on planning and zoning restrictions which the Government could change.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2019\u20132021.</ref>\n\n;Withholding of approval for CPF Board's budget\nIn December 1996, the CPA informed the President that for 1997 the CPF Board had budgeted for [[capital expenditure]] of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]27 million, which exceeded its [[operating surplus]] of $23 million. Although the intention was for the excess of $4 million to be funded out of the Board's accumulated surpluses, because a general election was due in 1997 the Board's accumulated surpluses would become past reserves and require the President's approval to be drawn upon. The Government explained that the CPF Board's accounts were prepared on an [[comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting|accrual basis]]. Thus, capital expenditure was [[depreciation|depreciated]] over the useful life of each [[asset]] and not indicated as a [[lump sum]] in the year of expenditure. The Board's operating surplus of $23 million had been computed on the basis of annual depreciation of $11 million being charged against the year's income. Hence, no drawdown on past reserves was required. The President expressed concern that accrual accounting would \"allow a profligate Government to hide its lavish spending under the guise of capital expenditures\". The Government disagreed, taking the view that accrual accounting was well established.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2021\u20132025.</ref>\n\n;Definition of net investment income\nThe President informed Government that he had been told that net investment income (NII) should be classified as current reserves, though he was not certain as he was not an accountant. The Government, having taken the Attorney-General's advice on the matter, said that NII was correctly treated as current income, as it is the [[interest]] and [[dividend]] [[passive income|income]] earned from investing the Government's reserves, less expenses on investment and debt servicing. It does not include [[capital gain]]s or [[capital loss|losses]] from the disposal of investments, which are regarded as investment adjustments. Since the Constitution provides that the President has only custodial powers over past reserves, these powers do not extend to NII as they are accumulated during the current term of office of the Government, even when the NII stems from the investment of past reserves that are themselves \"locked up\". Nonetheless, the Government would take into consideration a suggestion from the President and the CPA to lock away half of the NII derived from past reserves as past reserves.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2025\u20132027.</ref> In 2001, as indicated [[#Changes in the definition of net investment income|above]], the Government amended the Constitution to redefine how NII should be treated.\n\n;Government's change in treatment of NII\nFinally, the Government disagreed with the President that it had changed the way it treated NII. Furthermore, it had not been necessary to ask him to sanction the use of past reserves for its financial packages and the [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]] as it had enough budget surpluses built up within its current term of office.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2028\u20132029.</ref>\n\nFollowing discussions between the President and the Government, in 1999 the Government issued a non-binding [[white paper#Government white papers|white paper]] entitled ''The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies''.<ref name=\"1999 white paper\">{{citation|title=The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies [Cmd. 5 of 1999]|location=Singapore|publisher=Printed for the Government of Singapore by the Government Printers|year=1999|oclc=226180358}}.</ref> Speaking in Parliament on 17 August 1999, the Prime Minister said:\n\n{{quote|The Government does not expect the President to agree with it on every issue where he exercises custodial powers.

During this time, the Government briefed him and the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA), and the CPA considered the request and provided the President with its recommendation. Subsequently, at a press conference on 17 February, the President explained that when the Prime Minister had broached the subject informally on 10 January, he had agreed at that stage to give every consideration to the proposal as he and the CPA were already aware of the prevailing financial crisis and how it was impacting the country. He commented that he was not an Executive President and that the Executive was really the Government. It was for them to find solutions to the nation's problems and come out with proposals: \"As to whether the proposals were right or wrong, we don't micro-manage Government.

If after five years, no further major changes are necessary, we will consider entrenching the provisions concerning the President's custodial powers.}}\n\n=====Articles 5A and 22H=====\nThe original Article 22H of the Constitution provided the President with personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applies) which provided directly or indirectly for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon the President by the Constitution.<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1992|lk=off}}, Art. 22H(1): see {{citation|author=Gary Leonard Low|author2=Chia Jin Chong Daniel|title=Tribunal's Findings on the Powers of the Elected President|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1995|volume=16|pages=212\u2013227 at 213}}.</ref> At that time, Article 5(2A) provided that the President could prevent Parliament from passing a bill seeking to amend certain specified clauses of the Constitution, including those dealing with the President's powers, unless it had been supported by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast at a national referendum. However, as Article 5(2A) was not yet in force, a question arose as to whether the Government was entitled to amend the Constitution in a way that circumvented or curtailed the President's discretionary powers, or whether Article 22H prohibited this entirely.\n\nTo resolve the issue, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution to enable the President to refer to the [[Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal]] any question as to the effect of any constitutional provision. President Ong Teng Cheong then referred to the Tribunal, which  consisted of three Supreme Court judges, the issue of whether he had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H to restrict the application of the President's powers under that Article to non-constitutional bills. In a judgment delivered on 20 April 1995, the Tribunal held that even though Article 5(2A) was not in force, the Government's intent in including it as part of the Constitution had to be considered. Looking at it in this way, it was clear that Article 5(2A) was intended to deal with bills seeking to amend the Constitution, while Article 22H covered only ordinary bills. Therefore, the President had no power under Article 22H to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend the Constitution, and in particular any of the provisions referred to Article 5(2A).<ref>''Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995'' [1995] 1 S.L.R.(R) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 803, [[Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal]].</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Article 5A was inserted into the Constitution and Article 22H was amended; these changes clarified the situation by providing different procedures for circumventing or curtailing the President's discretionary power, depending on whether the Government seeks to do so by way of an ordinary bill or a bill seeking to amend the Constitution.<ref>The amendments were effected by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1996 (No. 41 of 1996).</ref> Article 22H deals with attempts to alter the President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President to refer to the Constitution Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced [[in open court]].<ref>Constitution, Arts. 22H(1), (2) and (3).</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Article 5A deals with attempts to alter the President's power by amending the Constitution itself. When the provision is brought into force, the President will also be able to decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or indirect effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal the question of whether the bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary and the Government wishes to push the amendment through in the face of the President's opposition to it, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the ''Government Gazette''.<ref>Constitution, Art. 5A.</ref>\n\n===Public expressions of opinion===\n\n====Views of presidential candidates and Government====\n[[File:Tony Tan Keng Yam detail, 981110-D-9880W-061.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tony Tan]] in November 1998.

Shanmugam. In a speech at a forum organized by the [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]], he argued that voters elect the President for the purpose of enabling him to exercise the discretionary powers granted to him under the Constitution, which means the President's accountability to the electorate is restricted to these matters. He then raised the argument that since Article 21(1) states that the President shall, \"in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet\", it would be unconstitutional for the President to speak on his own volition in the absence of Cabinet's advice. He also said that the President's constitutional position is similar to that of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]], quoting a letter of 4 December 1963 from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] to [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] in which it was stated that \"Ministers are willing to give an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion to what he would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which his Ministers would not approve\".<ref>{{citation|author=Stanley Baldwin|authorlink=Stanley Baldwin|title=Letter and Note by UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to King Edward VIII, 4 December 1936 &#91;UK National Archives reference no.

Goh said: \"We should not regard it as unusual for the President to publicly acknowledge differences between him and the Government.

Opponents of the idea that such soft powers exist rely on a strict interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that the usage of soft powers by the President will result in politicization of the office. While the existence and extent of the President's soft power have not been officially recognized, such power has been acknowledged as not insignificant.<ref name=\"TNP 20110802\"/> The President is the \"voice of the people\", and serves a function as a check and balance against the executive government.

First, unless the Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions the President has to act according to the advice of the Cabinet.<ref>Constitution, Art. 21(1): see {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|link=Yong Vui Kong v.

The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, the President does not have any liberty to exercise soft power.<ref>Compare {{citation|author=Vernon Bogdanor|authorlink=Vernon Bogdanor|title=The Monarchy and the Constitution|journal=[[Parliamentary Affairs]]|date=July 1996|volume=49|issue=3|pages=407\u2013422 at 414|doi=10.1093/pa/49.3.407}}.</ref> Furthermore, it has been argued that since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of \"[[legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]]\" posited by proponents<ref name=\"ST 20110707\"/> would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.<ref name=\"ST 20110721\"/>\n\nSecondly, the President serves the important symbolic function of representing the nation. The relationship between the Cabinet and the President may be compared with that between the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]]. [[Vernon Bogdanor]] has drawn a distinction between the \"efficient\" and \"dignified\" elements of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The former element is represented by the Cabinet which makes and executes policies, while the latter, represented by the monarchy, has little effective power but serves as a symbol around which citizens can unite.<ref>Bogdanor, p. 411.

Therefore, if the President exercises soft power, he would inevitably take sides and politicize his office.

In addition, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) when performing some of his functions. In other cases, he may consult the CPA if he wishes to but is not bound to do so.\n\nIn 1991 the [[Constitution of Singapore]] was amended to transform the office of President, which was previously [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] by [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]], into an office [[direct election|directly elected]] by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts by the [[Government of Singapore|government]] of the day to draw down past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified [[Government of Singapore#Statutory boards|statutory boards]] and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the [[Central Provident Fund Board]] to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.\n\nThe President is also empowered to approve changes to key [[Singapore Civil Service|civil service]] positions, such as the [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]], the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]], the chairman and members of the [[Public Service Commission (Singapore)|Public Service Commission]], the Chief of Defence Force and the [[Commissioner of Police (Singapore)|Commissioner of Police]]. He also appoints as [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] a [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) who, in his personal judgment, is likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The President has certain powers of oversight over the [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] and decisions of the Executive under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] and the [[Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act]].\n\nThe term of office of the first popularly elected President, [[Ong Teng Cheong]] (1993\u20131999), was marked by differences between him and the Government concerning the extent of his discretionary fiscal powers. Discussions culminated in the Government issuing a non-binding [[white paper#Government white papers|white paper]] entitled ''The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies'' (1999). In 2009, the Government requested approval from President [[S. R. Nathan]] to draw [[Singapore dollar|S$]]4.9 billion from past financial reserves to meet current budget expenditure, the first time it had done so. The sum was used to fund the Government's Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial downturn]].\n\nWhether the President may speak publicly on issues without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the [[2011 Singaporean presidential election|2011 presidential election]]. While some candidates and members of the public suggested that the President has power to do so, the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Law Minister]], [[K. Shanmugam|K.&nbsp;Shanmugam]], stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. A difference of opinion also exists over whether the President exercises [[soft power]].\n\n==Grant of powers to the President==\n[[File:Halimah Yacob APEC Women and the Economy Forum 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Halimah Yacob]] in June 2012.

The [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], photographed here in September 2009, is one such statutory board.]]\n\nAs the fiscal guardian for the nation's past reserves (that is, reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office), the President's concurrence is required for a number of financial transactions that the Government may wish to enter into. A guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, whether the transaction is authorized by a [[resolution (law)|resolution]] of Parliament or is made under one of eight specified statutes.<ref>Constitution, Art. 144(1).</ref> The President's approval is also needed for budgets of specified [[Government of Singapore#Statutory boards|statutory boards]] and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The statutory boards that come under the President's purview are the [[Central Provident Fund Board]] (CPF Board), the [[Housing and Development Board]], [[JTC Corporation]] and the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], while the Government companies are the [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation|Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte.

If so, the President may exercise personal discretion to disapprove the budget. If he approves the budget even though he is of the opinion that the budget is likely to draw upon past reserves, the decision and opinion must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. Similarly, statutory boards and Government companies are bound to inform the President of financial transactions that are likely to draw on past reserves, and the President has personal discretion as to whether such transactions should be approved.<ref>Constitution, Arts. 21(2)(e), 21(2)(f), 22B and 22D.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the President possesses personal discretion to withhold his assent to any [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for:\n\n*the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the CPF Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and<ref>Constitution, Art. 22E.</ref>\n*the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office.<ref>Constitution, Art. 144(2).</ref>\n\nThe President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.

In 1994, the Constitution was amended to allow statutory boards and Government companies to transfer their reserves to the Government, provided that the Minister for Finance gave a written [[wikt:undertaking#Noun|undertaking]] that these sums would be added to past reserves.

If no certification is made, at least 50% of the NII of the financial year derived from past reserves has to be classified as past reserves.

In particular, he mentioned:\n\n*that the Accountant-General had informed him it would take 52 [[man-hour#Similar units|man-years]] to provide him with a list of the Government's physical assets;\n*an \"unpleasant\" encounter in which he had felt compelled to withhold approval of the budget of the [[Central Provident Fund Board]] (CPF Board) as it would have drawn on its past reserves;\n*a disagreement regarding whether net investment income (NII) should be treated as current or past reserves; and\n*his \"disappointment\" that the Government had changed its treatment of NII so as not to require him to approve the use of past reserves to finance its package of cost-cutting measures aimed at combating the effects of the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].<ref>{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Richard Hu Tsu Tau|mplink=Hu Tsu Tau Richard|office=[[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]]|title=Issues Raised by President Ong Teng Cheong at his Press Conference on 16th July 1999 (Statements by the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00067029-ZZ|date=17 August 1999|volume=70|column=2018}} (\"Ministerial Statement\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Hu Tsu Tau Richard|Richard Hu Tsu Tau]] and the Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] made ministerial statements in Parliament on 17 August 1999 explaining the Government's views on the points raised.\n\n;Access to information\nTo exercise his constitutional functions, the President is entitled to request information about the Government which is available to the Cabinet, and about the statutory boards and Government companies listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution which is available to the board's members or the company's directors. The President may also ask any Minister, senior officer of a ministry or a government department, CEO and members of the governing board of a statutory board, and directors of any Government company to furnish information concerning the reserves of the Government, a statutory board or a Government company.<ref>Constitution, Art. 22F.</ref> At a meeting with the Accountant-General in August 1996, the President, having been given a list of the Government's physical assets, had commented that the monetary value of the assets should have been stated. The Accountant-General had then stated it\nwould take 56 (not 52) man-years to value the properties.\n\nThe Minister for Finance explained that his Ministry had asked the Attorney-General to advise it as to whether such a valuation was necessary. The Attorney-General's Chambers subsequently stated that the Constitution did not require Government property to be revalued, as the issue of whether past reserves were being drawn upon did not arise unless ownership of a piece of property was about to be transferred. In addition, a revaluation would lead to unnecessary expense since much state land would remain as such, and the value of each piece of land depended on planning and zoning restrictions which the Government could change.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2019\u20132021.</ref>\n\n;Withholding of approval for CPF Board's budget\nIn December 1996, the CPA informed the President that for 1997 the CPF Board had budgeted for [[capital expenditure]] of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]27 million, which exceeded its [[operating surplus]] of $23 million. Although the intention was for the excess of $4 million to be funded out of the Board's accumulated surpluses, because a general election was due in 1997 the Board's accumulated surpluses would become past reserves and require the President's approval to be drawn upon. The Government explained that the CPF Board's accounts were prepared on an [[comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting|accrual basis]]. Thus, capital expenditure was [[depreciation|depreciated]] over the useful life of each [[asset]] and not indicated as a [[lump sum]] in the year of expenditure. The Board's operating surplus of $23 million had been computed on the basis of annual depreciation of $11 million being charged against the year's income. Hence, no drawdown on past reserves was required. The President expressed concern that accrual accounting would \"allow a profligate Government to hide its lavish spending under the guise of capital expenditures\". The Government disagreed, taking the view that accrual accounting was well established.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2021\u20132025.</ref>\n\n;Definition of net investment income\nThe President informed Government that he had been told that net investment income (NII) should be classified as current reserves, though he was not certain as he was not an accountant. The Government, having taken the Attorney-General's advice on the matter, said that NII was correctly treated as current income, as it is the [[interest]] and [[dividend]] [[passive income|income]] earned from investing the Government's reserves, less expenses on investment and debt servicing. It does not include [[capital gain]]s or [[capital loss|losses]] from the disposal of investments, which are regarded as investment adjustments. Since the Constitution provides that the President has only custodial powers over past reserves, these powers do not extend to NII as they are accumulated during the current term of office of the Government, even when the NII stems from the investment of past reserves that are themselves \"locked up\". Nonetheless, the Government would take into consideration a suggestion from the President and the CPA to lock away half of the NII derived from past reserves as past reserves.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2025\u20132027.</ref> In 2001, as indicated [[#Changes in the definition of net investment income|above]], the Government amended the Constitution to redefine how NII should be treated.\n\n;Government's change in treatment of NII\nFinally, the Government disagreed with the President that it had changed the way it treated NII. Furthermore, it had not been necessary to ask him to sanction the use of past reserves for its financial packages and the [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]] as it had enough budget surpluses built up within its current term of office.<ref>Richard Hu, Ministerial Statement (17 August 1999), cols. 2028\u20132029.</ref>\n\nFollowing discussions between the President and the Government, in 1999 the Government issued a non-binding [[white paper#Government white papers|white paper]] entitled ''The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies''.<ref name=\"1999 white paper\">{{citation|title=The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies [Cmd. 5 of 1999]|location=Singapore|publisher=Printed for the Government of Singapore by the Government Printers|year=1999|oclc=226180358}}.</ref> Speaking in Parliament on 17 August 1999, the Prime Minister said:\n\n{{quote|The Government does not expect the President to agree with it on every issue where he exercises custodial powers.

R. Nathan]] to draw $4.9 billion from past financial reserves to meet current budget expenditure, the first time it had done so. The sum was used to fund the Government's Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial downturn]]: the Jobs Credit scheme, which provided employers with financial assistance to pay employees' salaries; and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative, which helped mid-sized companies to obtain credit.<ref>{{citation|author=Zakir Hussain|title=A Budget first: Govt to draw $4.9b from past reserves|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 January 2009}}.</ref> The President gave in-principle approval 11 days later on 21 January. During this time, the Government briefed him and the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA), and the CPA considered the request and provided the President with its recommendation. Subsequently, at a press conference on 17 February, the President explained that when the Prime Minister had broached the subject informally on 10 January, he had agreed at that stage to give every consideration to the proposal as he and the CPA were already aware of the prevailing financial crisis and how it was impacting the country. He commented that he was not an Executive President and that the Executive was really the Government. It was for them to find solutions to the nation's problems and come out with proposals: \"As to whether the proposals were right or wrong, we don't micro-manage Government. And it's for the Government in power to determine what is to be done.\" However, \"[i]f they came with scatterbrained proposals I would have said no.\"<ref>{{citation|title=Concerns about economy go back to mid-2008: President makes public for first time his decision to allow use of reserves|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=18 February 2009}}; see also {{citation|author=Chua Mui Hoong|title=Turning of the second key went smoothly|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=20 February 2009}}.

However, as Article 5(2A) was not yet in force, a question arose as to whether the Government was entitled to amend the Constitution in a way that circumvented or curtailed the President's discretionary powers, or whether Article 22H prohibited this entirely.\n\nTo resolve the issue, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution to enable the President to refer to the [[Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal]] any question as to the effect of any constitutional provision. President Ong Teng Cheong then referred to the Tribunal, which  consisted of three Supreme Court judges, the issue of whether he had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H to restrict the application of the President's powers under that Article to non-constitutional bills. In a judgment delivered on 20 April 1995, the Tribunal held that even though Article 5(2A) was not in force, the Government's intent in including it as part of the Constitution had to be considered. Looking at it in this way, it was clear that Article 5(2A) was intended to deal with bills seeking to amend the Constitution, while Article 22H covered only ordinary bills. Therefore, the President had no power under Article 22H to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend the Constitution, and in particular any of the provisions referred to Article 5(2A).<ref>''Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995'' [1995] 1 S.L.R.(R) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 803, [[Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal]].</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Article 5A was inserted into the Constitution and Article 22H was amended; these changes clarified the situation by providing different procedures for circumventing or curtailing the President's discretionary power, depending on whether the Government seeks to do so by way of an ordinary bill or a bill seeking to amend the Constitution.<ref>The amendments were effected by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1996 (No. 41 of 1996).</ref> Article 22H deals with attempts to alter the President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President to refer to the Constitution Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced [[in open court]].<ref>Constitution, Arts. 22H(1), (2) and (3).</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Article 5A deals with attempts to alter the President's power by amending the Constitution itself. When the provision is brought into force, the President will also be able to decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or indirect effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal the question of whether the bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary and the Government wishes to push the amendment through in the face of the President's opposition to it, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the ''Government Gazette''.<ref>Constitution, Art. 5A.</ref>\n\n===Public expressions of opinion===\n\n====Views of presidential candidates and Government====\n[[File:Tony Tan Keng Yam detail, 981110-D-9880W-061.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tony Tan]] in November 1998.

In a speech at a forum organized by the [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]], he argued that voters elect the President for the purpose of enabling him to exercise the discretionary powers granted to him under the Constitution, which means the President's accountability to the electorate is restricted to these matters. He then raised the argument that since Article 21(1) states that the President shall, \"in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet\", it would be unconstitutional for the President to speak on his own volition in the absence of Cabinet's advice. He also said that the President's constitutional position is similar to that of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]], quoting a letter of 4 December 1963 from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] to [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] in which it was stated that \"Ministers are willing to give an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion to what he would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which his Ministers would not approve\".<ref>{{citation|author=Stanley Baldwin|authorlink=Stanley Baldwin|title=Letter and Note by UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to King Edward VIII, 4 December 1936 &#91;UK National Archives reference no.

Goh said: \"We should not regard it as unusual for the President to publicly acknowledge differences between him and the Government.

Opponents of the idea that such soft powers exist rely on a strict interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that the usage of soft powers by the President will result in politicization of the office. While the existence and extent of the President's soft power have not been officially recognized, such power has been acknowledged as not insignificant.<ref name=\"TNP 20110802\"/> The President is the \"voice of the people\", and serves a function as a check and balance against the executive government. As such, the presence of such soft powers makes the President more than merely a ceremonial head.<ref name=\"ST 20110707\"/>\n\nThe Government has so far only appeared to implicitly endorse, and not oppose, two categories of soft power: the President's private influence in politics, and his public involvement in non-political affairs.

The relationship between the Cabinet and the President may be compared with that between the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]]. [[Vernon Bogdanor]] has drawn a distinction between the \"efficient\" and \"dignified\" elements of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The former element is represented by the Cabinet which makes and executes policies, while the latter, represented by the monarchy, has little effective power but serves as a symbol around which citizens can unite.<ref>Bogdanor, p. 411.

Acceptance typically contains the concept of approval; the [[Psychology|psycho]]-[[Spirituality|spiritual]] use of the term infers a non-judgmental mindset. Acceptance is contrasted with ''resistance'', a term that has strong political and [[psychoanalytic]] connotations that do not apply in most contexts. Groups and individuals can show acceptance of various events and conditions in the world; individuals may accept elements of their own thoughts, feelings, and personal histories. For example, [[psychotherapeutic]] treatment of a person with [[depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]] can involve fostering acceptance either for whatever personal circumstances may give rise to those feelings or for the feelings themselves. Psychotherapy can also involve lessening an individual's acceptance of various situations.\n\nNotions of acceptance are prominent in many faiths and meditation practices. For example, [[Buddhism]]'s [[Four Noble Truths|first noble truth]], \"All life is suffering\", invites people to accept that [[suffering]] is a natural part of life. The term \"[[Kabbalah]]\" literally means acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Minority group]]s in society often describe their goal as acceptance, wherein the [[Normative social influence|majority]] will not [[marginalize]] the minority's full participation in society. A majority may be said to [[Toleration|tolerate]] minorities when it confines their participation to certain aspects of society, but not accept them.\n\nAcceptance is the fifth stage of the [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model]] (commonly known as the \"stages of dying\").\n\n''The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous'' describes the importance of acceptance in the treatment of alcoholism. It states that acceptance can be used to resolve situations where a person feels disturbed by a \"person, place, thing or situation \u2013 some fact of [their] life \u2013 [which is] unacceptable to [them]\". It claims that an alcoholic person cannot find serenity until they accept that \"nothing happens in God's world by mistake\" and that the condition of alcoholism must be accepted as a given.<ref>Dr Paul O, \"The big book of Alcoholics Anonymous\" P449, 3rd ed or P417, 4th ed.</ref>\n\n===Self-acceptance===\n{{main|Self-acceptance}}\nSelf-acceptance is being satisfied with one's current [[self]].

A person has been made an offer that they are willing to agree on as long as some changes are made in its terms or that some conditions or event occurs gives conditional acceptance. In a contract that is made from a business to the employer, both parties may change and modify the contract until both parties agree or accept the details in the business contract.\n\n===Expressed===\n\nExpressed acceptance involves making an [[wikt:overt|overt]] and unambiguous acceptance of the set conditions. For example, a person clearly and explicitly agreeing to an offer. They accept the terms without any changes.\n\n===Implied===\n\nImplied acceptance has one's intents to consent to the presented conditions made. Acceptance is implied by demonstrating any act indicating a person's assent to the proposed bargain. If a person selects an item in a department store and pays the cashier for it, the person thereby indicates that they agree to the offer of the item for the price stated on the price tag.\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\nAcceptance is fundamental to the core beliefs of most [[Abrahamic]] religions: the word \"[[Islam]]\" can be translated as \"acceptance\", \"surrender\" or \"voluntary submission\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVyMAvW9slYC&pg=PA8&dq=surrender+to+will+of+God+islam#v=onepage&q=surrender%20to%20will%20of%20God%20islam&f=false|first1=Bernard Ellis|last1=Lewis|first2=Buntzie Ellis|last2=Churchill|title=Islam: The Religion and the People|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2009|isbn=9780132716062}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=admin |title=What does ISLAM mean? |url=http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |work=The Friday Journal |publisher=qaem.org |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314072458/http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}</ref> and [[Christianity]] is based upon the \"acceptance\" of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the [[Christ]] and acceptance of God's will. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest a path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and [[fate]]d, or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk. Acceptance may imply only a lack of outward, behavioral attempts at possible change, but the word is also used more specifically for a felt or hypothesized [[cognitive]] or [[emotional]] state.\n\nWithin [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs, acceptance is characterized as embracing the reality of a situation based on one's [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] in God's perfect will and control. In the [[Muslim]] community, acceptance of Allah is similar to people that are considered [[Christians|Christian]] and how they accept God as their higher being (Bates, 2002). [[Judaism|Jewish]] people accept the [[Ten Commandments|Commandments]] as a way to live and have a good and fulfilling life (Mcdowell and Stewart, 1983).\n\n[[Belief]]s and acceptance overlap in meaning. The acceptance of one's beliefs is important to show commitment and structure of one's life. Not only is it vital for [[Surviving|survival]], but it is used in everyday relationships.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Being accepted by a friend has shown to positively affect an individual's [[self-esteem]] and [[well-being]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} In fact, without acceptance, it could lead to a host of psychological issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://law.jrank.org/pages/3949/Acceptance-Types-Acceptance.html \"Acceptance - Types Of Acceptance.\"] Law Library - American Law and Legal Information. 8 Apr. 2009.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090420132940/http://www.essortment.com/all/stagesofgri_rvkg.htm \"The 5 stages of grief.\"] Essortment Articles: Free Online Articles on Health, Science, Education & More. 12 Apr. 2009.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090212221847/http://gettingpastyourpast.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/the-last-phase-of-grief-reorganization-integration-and-acceptance/ \"The Last Phase of Grief: Acceptance, Reorganization and Integration.\"] Getting Past Your Past. 14 Apr. 2009.\n* [http://solitaryroad.com/a168.html \"The need for social acceptance and approval --- its power.\"] The Way.

Many people don't understand mental illness, so they are unsure of how to embrace people who have a disease, leaving these people with feelings of [[Social isolation|isolation]] in friend groups.\n\n===Conditional===\n[[File:Infant furniture acceptable gaps.svg|thumb|Standards specify acceptable and hazardous gaps in [[infant bed]]s]]\n\nA type of acceptance that requires modification of the initial conditions before the final acceptance is made, is called conditional acceptance, or qualified acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} For example, a contract that needs to be accepted from two parties may be adjusted or modified so that it fits both parties' satisfactions. A person has been made an offer that they are willing to agree on as long as some changes are made in its terms or that some conditions or event occurs gives conditional acceptance. In a contract that is made from a business to the employer, both parties may change and modify the contract until both parties agree or accept the details in the business contract.\n\n===Expressed===\n\nExpressed acceptance involves making an [[wikt:overt|overt]] and unambiguous acceptance of the set conditions. For example, a person clearly and explicitly agreeing to an offer. They accept the terms without any changes.\n\n===Implied===\n\nImplied acceptance has one's intents to consent to the presented conditions made. Acceptance is implied by demonstrating any act indicating a person's assent to the proposed bargain. If a person selects an item in a department store and pays the cashier for it, the person thereby indicates that they agree to the offer of the item for the price stated on the price tag.\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\nAcceptance is fundamental to the core beliefs of most [[Abrahamic]] religions: the word \"[[Islam]]\" can be translated as \"acceptance\", \"surrender\" or \"voluntary submission\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVyMAvW9slYC&pg=PA8&dq=surrender+to+will+of+God+islam#v=onepage&q=surrender%20to%20will%20of%20God%20islam&f=false|first1=Bernard Ellis|last1=Lewis|first2=Buntzie Ellis|last2=Churchill|title=Islam: The Religion and the People|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2009|isbn=9780132716062}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=admin |title=What does ISLAM mean? |url=http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |work=The Friday Journal |publisher=qaem.org |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314072458/http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}</ref> and [[Christianity]] is based upon the \"acceptance\" of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the [[Christ]] and acceptance of God's will. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest a path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and [[fate]]d, or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk. Acceptance may imply only a lack of outward, behavioral attempts at possible change, but the word is also used more specifically for a felt or hypothesized [[cognitive]] or [[emotional]] state.\n\nWithin [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs, acceptance is characterized as embracing the reality of a situation based on one's [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] in God's perfect will and control. In the [[Muslim]] community, acceptance of Allah is similar to people that are considered [[Christians|Christian]] and how they accept God as their higher being (Bates, 2002). [[Judaism|Jewish]] people accept the [[Ten Commandments|Commandments]] as a way to live and have a good and fulfilling life (Mcdowell and Stewart, 1983).\n\n[[Belief]]s and acceptance overlap in meaning. The acceptance of one's beliefs is important to show commitment and structure of one's life. Not only is it vital for [[Surviving|survival]], but it is used in everyday relationships.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Being accepted by a friend has shown to positively affect an individual's [[self-esteem]] and [[well-being]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} In fact, without acceptance, it could lead to a host of psychological issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://law.jrank.org/pages/3949/Acceptance-Types-Acceptance.html \"Acceptance - Types Of Acceptance.\"] Law Library - American Law and Legal Information. 8 Apr. 2009.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090420132940/http://www.essortment.com/all/stagesofgri_rvkg.htm \"The 5 stages of grief.\"] Essortment Articles: Free Online Articles on Health, Science, Education & More. 12 Apr. 2009.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090212221847/http://gettingpastyourpast.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/the-last-phase-of-grief-reorganization-integration-and-acceptance/ \"The Last Phase of Grief: Acceptance, Reorganization and Integration.\"] Getting Past Your Past. 14 Apr. 2009.\n* [http://solitaryroad.com/a168.html \"The need for social acceptance and approval --- its power.\"] The Way.

Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it is later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town just then and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it is \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish and [[USA|american]] hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nSix years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]].

As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it is muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's deleting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, while other \"re-translations\" continued to reproduce its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nA modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans).

Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nA few years prior, in 1962, Anthony Bonner had published an essentially complete translation of the novel for [[Bantam Classics]]. A specially written introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]], compared Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nMercier's errors were again corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources and a new translation by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] in a \"completely restored and annotated edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online for readers only.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an introduction and extensive textual notes, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]].\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation from the French original, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. The film's script elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to get at Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film. Also, Nemo's submarine confines her movements to a defined, circular section of the Pacific Ocean, unlike the original ''Nautilus''. \n\nFinally, Nemo is likewise depicted as East Indian in the Soviet 3-episode TV film ''[[Captain Nemo (film)|Captain Nemo]]'' (1975), which also includes some plot details from ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* {{annotated link|French corvette Alecton}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea|''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers''}}\n{{Commons category|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n*[http://jv.gilead.org.il/fpwalter ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''], p.d. trans. by F.

Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it is later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town just then and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it is \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nSix years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]].

As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it is muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's deleting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, while other \"re-translations\" continued to reproduce its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nA modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nA few years prior, in 1962, Anthony Bonner had published an essentially complete translation of the novel for [[Bantam Classics]]. A specially written introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]], compared Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nMercier's errors were again corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources and a new translation by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] in a \"completely restored and annotated edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online for readers only.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an introduction and extensive textual notes, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]].\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation from the French original, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. The film's script elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to get at Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film. Also, Nemo's submarine confines her movements to a defined, circular section of the Pacific Ocean, unlike the original ''Nautilus''. \n\nFinally, Nemo is likewise depicted as East Indian in the Soviet 3-episode TV film ''[[Captain Nemo (film)|Captain Nemo]]'' (1975), which also includes some plot details from ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* {{annotated link|French corvette Alecton}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea|''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers''}}\n{{Commons category|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n*[http://jv.gilead.org.il/fpwalter ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''], p.d. trans. by F.
