Francis tries to keep the two from meeting, in order to avoid each of them learning that Francis is also working for someone else. Complicating events, Roscoe is really Rachel Crabbe in disguise, her twin brother Roscoe having been killed by her boyfriend, who is none other than Stanley. Complicating events still further is local mobster Charlie the Duck, who has arranged his daughter Pauline's engagement to Roscoe despite her preference for over-the-top amateur actor Alan Dangle. Even further complications are prompted by several letters, a very heavy trunk, several unlucky audience volunteers, an extremely elderly waiter and Francis' pursuit of his twin passions:  Dolly (Charlie's feminist bookkeeper), food and drink.\n\n==Productions==\n===National Theatre (2011)===\nThe play premiered at the National Theatre's [[Lyttelton Theatre]] from 24 May 2011 (previews from 17 May) and continued until 19 September.

Complicating events still further is local mobster Charlie the Duck, who has arranged his daughter Pauline's engagement to Roscoe despite her preference for over-the-top amateur actor Alan Dangle. Even further complications are prompted by several letters, a very heavy trunk, several unlucky audience volunteers, an extremely elderly waiter and Francis' pursuit of his twin passions:  Dolly (Charlie's feminist bookkeeper), food and drink.\n\n==Productions==\n===National Theatre (2011)===\nThe play premiered at the National Theatre's [[Lyttelton Theatre]] from 24 May 2011 (previews from 17 May) and continued until 19 September.
