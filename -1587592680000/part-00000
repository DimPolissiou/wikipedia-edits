The \"[[flying height]]\" is constantly decreasing to enable higher [[Areal density (computer storage)|areal density]]. The flying height of the head is controlled by the design of an [[Fluid bearing|air-bearing]] etched onto the disk-facing surface of the ''slider''. The role of the air bearing is to maintain the flying height constant as the head moves over the surface of the disk. If the head hits the disk's surface, a catastrophic [[head crash]] can result.\n\n\n== Inductive heads ==\nInductive heads use the same element for both reading and writing.\n=== Traditional head ===\nThe heads themselves started out similar to the heads in [[tape recorder]]s\u2014simple devices made out of a tiny C-shaped piece of highly magnetizable material such as [[permalloy]] or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] wrapped in a fine wire coil.  When writing, the coil is energized, a strong [[magnetic field]] forms in the gap of the C, and the recording surface adjacent to the gap is magnetized.  When reading, the magnetized material rotates past the heads, the [[magnetic core|ferrite core]] concentrates the field, and a [[current (electricity)|current]] is generated in the coil.

It is the sixth ''Forza Motorsport'' and eighth overall installment in the [[Forza (series)|''Forza'' series]], and available worldwide on September 15, 2015. On March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced '''''Forza Motorsport 6: Apex''''', a [[free-to-play]] version for [[Windows 10 Anniversary Update]] and later. It was released on September 6, 2016.\n\n''Forza Motorsport 6'' features new gameplay elements, such as rain and night racing returned from [[Forza Motorsport|first title]]. Also featured, is a new story mode called \"Stories of Motorsport\", which offers approximately 70 hours of gameplay. ''Forza Motorsport 6'' features more than 450 cars, more than twice the number of cars in ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]'', and 27 tracks in all, of which seven are new to this game along with returnings.\n\nFirst revealed during the [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] on January 12, 2015, Turn 10 continued to partner with [[BBC]] automotive series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]],'' and features the show's [[Top Gear test track|test track]] at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]]. Unlike the previous two installments, the game features no commentary from the show's hosts. Turn 10 also partnered with [[Ford Motor Company]], the manufacturer of the 2017 [[Ford GT#Second generation (2017\u2013)|Ford GT]] cover car.\n\nUpon release, ''Forza Motorsport 6'' received generally positive reviews, with critics agreeing it to be an improvement over its predecessor and praising the game's visuals, gameplay and game modes.\n\n==Gameplay==forza horizo\n[[File:Forza Motorsport 6 screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Forza Motorsport 6'' features racing in rainy conditions on several tracks]]\n''Forza Motorsport 6'' is a [[racing video game]] which allows the player to race many vehicles across different racing disciplines and courses. Vehicle handling is simulation-based, meaning that each vehicle behaves as closely to its real-world counterpart as possible. Courses are primarily digital representations of real tracks, with 22 tracks based on real locations, and four being fictional. Races consist of up to 24 vehicles competing, and weather elements such as rain can affect vehicle handling.\n\nPlayers can compete in various championships, which are divided based on vehicle manufacturer region, vehicle age, power, drivetrain, racing discipline, and other categories. Each championship consists of multiple races. Additionally exhibition races can be run, which are single events. Awards are generally better with championship races, while exhibitions require less of a time commitment from the player.  The game offers both [[split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] multiplayer and online play through [[Xbox Live]].\n\nSeveral [[downloadable content]] expansion packs have been released during the game's life cycle. Monthly car packs were released through August 2016, each featuring seven cars. A 10 car expansion featuring cars from [[The Fast and the Furious]] franchise was made available on September 15, 2015. Two major expansions, the [[Porsche]] expansion pack and the [[NASCAR]] expansion pack, featured both cars and an additional track. The NASCAR expansion also featured a racing campaign for players to complete. Other promotional cars were released in conjunction with other releases. Examples include the 2069 Chryslus Rocket, which was featured in ''[[Fallout 4]]'' and [[Dominic Toretto]]'s 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#Second generation|Dodge Charger]], which coincided with the release of ''[[Furious 7]]''.\n\n==Development and marketing==\n[[File:Kyle_Busch,_2013_STP_Gas_Booster_500.JPG|thumb|right|A [[NASCAR]] expansion was made available in ''Forza Motorsport 6'' via [[downloadable content]].

He praised the game's rewind feature, visual upgrade, and graphical details. He also praised the Drivatar [[artificial intelligence]] system, due to their unstable behaviors. He thought that racing against these AI bots is as fun as racing against other players in the competitive multiplayer mode. He also described the content delivered by ''Forza Motorsport 6'' as \"more than a full game\", due to the increased number of both cars and tracks.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n\nRay Carsillo from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also shared similar enthusiasm about the game.  He stated that night racing and weather effects have effectively introduced more variety to the game. He commended the new online features implemented, and he thought that these features effectively extend the game's longevity. He also praised the game's physics and visuals but disliked the tracks featured, which he found repetitive. He considered it as the best entry in the entire series, and recommended racing game lovers to play the game.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Luke Reilly from [[IGN]] applauded its weather system, as he thought it was both visually and physically impressive, and the night-driving sections and races. He liked its core mechanics and car handling, as well as the varied cars featured. He considered it as a leap forward from ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]'', but criticized the tracks for being \"snapshots of a certain time of day and temperature\" and concluded that the track conditions are \"baked in\". Nevertheless, he called it one of the best racing games for consoles.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nMiguel Concepcion from [[GameSpot]] praised the Drivatar system and the Driving Mods, as he thought that they have added more variety to races. He praised the system that rewards players using challenging settings with a corresponding number of credits and applauded the multiplayer modes featured in the game, which he thought suit the style of all kind of players, both new and old, but criticized the pre- and post-race visuals and replays for running at fewer than 60 frames per second. He also lauded the [[artificial intelligence]] for being \"unpredictable\".<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> However, Matthew Kato from ''[[Game Informer]]'' felt that the weather system was exaggerated, and added that they may take away the fun of some races, and the overhauled career mode, which he described as \"somewhere between those in ''Forza 5'' and ''[[Forza 4]]''\" is not engaging enough for most players. However, he praised the number of cars and tracks featured, as well as its high replay value.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Justin Towell from [[GamesRadar]] criticized the game's slow-paced career mode, as he felt that it has failed to deliver an intense experience. He also felt the handling was \"odd\" and the Drivatar system was \"inconsistent\". However, he praised the rich content featured, and added that by comparison, ''Forza 6'' makes ''Forza 5'' to look like a game demo instead of a full game.<ref name=\"GRadar\" />\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | List of awards and nominations\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Award\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Category\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Result\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Ref.\n|-\n| [[The Game Awards 2015]]\n| Best Sports/Racing Game\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"TGA: won\">{{cite web|url=http://thegameawards.com/nominees/ |title=Nominees {{!}} The Game Awards 2015 |date=November 12, 2015 |website=[[The Game Awards]] |publisher=[[Ola Balola]] |accessdate=November 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114024126/http://thegameawards.com/nominees/ |archivedate=November 14, 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 19th Annual DICE Awards\n| Racing Game of the Year\n| {{won}}\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2016-dice-award-winners-updated/1100-6434830/|title=The 2016 DICE Award Winners [UPDATED]|first=Chris|last=Pereira|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.forzamotorsport.net/games/fm6 Official website]\n* {{MobyGames|id=/forza-motorsport-6|name=Forza Motorsport 6}}\n\n{{Forza series}}\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:2015 video games]]\n[[Category:Forza series]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Split-screen multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n<!--TO DO track locations by state/country:-->\n[[Category:Video games set in Australia]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Video games set in England]]\n[[Category:Video games set in France]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Indianapolis]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Miami]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Spain]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Arab Emirates]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title = Forza Motorsport 6\n| image = Forza Motorsport 6 Cover.jpg\n\n| caption = Cover art featuring the 2017 [[Ford GT#Second generation (2016\u20132020)|Ford GT]]\n\n| developer = [[Turn 10 Studios]]\n| publisher = [[Microsoft Studios]]\n| series = ''[[Forza (series)|Forza]]''\n| platforms = [[Xbox One]]<br>[[Windows 10 Anniversary Update]] and later\n| released = '''Xbox One'''{{vgrelease|NA|September 15, 2015|EU|September 18, 2015}}'''Microsoft Windows'''{{vgrelease|WW|September 6, 2016}}\n| genre = [[Racing game|Racing]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n}}\n\n'''''Forza Motorsport 6''''' is a [[racing video game]] developed by [[Turn 10 Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]] for the [[Xbox One]]. It is the sixth ''Forza Motorsport'' and eighth overall installment in the [[Forza (series)|''Forza'' series]], and available worldwide on September 15, 2015. On March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced '''''Forza Motorsport 6: Apex''''', a [[free-to-play]] version for [[Windows 10 Anniversary Update]] and later. It was released on September 6, 2016.\n\n''Forza Motorsport 6'' features new gameplay elements, such as rain and night racing returned from [[Forza Motorsport|first title]]. Also featured, is a new story mode called \"Stories of Motorsport\", which offers approximately 70 hours of gameplay. ''Forza Motorsport 6'' features more than 450 cars, more than twice the number of cars in ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]'', and 27 tracks in all, of which seven are new to this game along with returnings.\n\nFirst revealed during the [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] on January 12, 2015, Turn 10 continued to partner with [[BBC]] automotive series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]],'' and features the show's [[Top Gear test track|test track]] at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]]. Unlike the previous two installments, the game features no commentary from the show's hosts. Turn 10 also partnered with [[Ford Motor Company]], the manufacturer of the 2017 [[Ford GT#Second generation (2017\u2013)|Ford GT]] cover car.\n\nUpon release, ''Forza Motorsport 6'' received generally positive reviews, with critics agreeing it to be an improvement over its predecessor and praising the game's visuals, gameplay and game modes.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Forza Motorsport 6 screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Forza Motorsport 6'' features racing in rainy conditions on several tracks]]\n''Forza Motorsport 6'' is a [[racing video game]] which allows the player to race many vehicles across different racing disciplines and courses. Vehicle handling is simulation-based, meaning that each vehicle behaves as closely to its real-world counterpart as possible. Courses are primarily digital representations of real tracks, with 22 tracks based on real locations, and four being fictional. Races consist of up to 24 vehicles competing, and weather elements such as rain can affect vehicle handling.\n\nPlayers can compete in various championships, which are divided based on vehicle manufacturer region, vehicle age, power, drivetrain, racing discipline, and other categories. Each championship consists of multiple races. Additionally exhibition races can be run, which are single events. Awards are generally better with championship races, while exhibitions require less of a time commitment from the player.  The game offers both [[split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] multiplayer and online play through [[Xbox Live]].\n\nSeveral [[downloadable content]] expansion packs have been released during the game's life cycle. Monthly car packs were released through August 2016, each featuring seven cars. A 10 car expansion featuring cars from [[The Fast and the Furious]] franchise was made available on September 15, 2015. Two major expansions, the [[Porsche]] expansion pack and the [[NASCAR]] expansion pack, featured both cars and an additional track. The NASCAR expansion also featured a racing campaign for players to complete. Other promotional cars were released in conjunction with other releases. Examples include the 2069 Chryslus Rocket, which was featured in ''[[Fallout 4]]'' and [[Dominic Toretto]]'s 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#Second generation|Dodge Charger]], which coincided with the release of ''[[Furious 7]]''.\n\n==Development and marketing==\n[[File:Kyle_Busch,_2013_STP_Gas_Booster_500.JPG|thumb|right|A [[NASCAR]] expansion was made available in ''Forza Motorsport 6'' via [[downloadable content]].

He praised the game's rewind feature, visual upgrade, and graphical details. He also praised the Drivatar [[artificial intelligence]] system, due to their unstable behaviors. He thought that racing against these AI bots is as fun as racing against other players in the competitive multiplayer mode. He also described the content delivered by ''Forza Motorsport 6'' as \"more than a full game\", due to the increased number of both cars and tracks.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n\nRay Carsillo from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also shared similar enthusiasm about the game.  He stated that night racing and weather effects have effectively introduced more variety to the game. He commended the new online features implemented, and he thought that these features effectively extend the game's longevity. He also praised the game's physics and visuals but disliked the tracks featured, which he found repetitive. He considered it as the best entry in the entire series, and recommended racing game lovers to play the game.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Luke Reilly from [[IGN]] applauded its weather system, as he thought it was both visually and physically impressive, and the night-driving sections and races. He liked its core mechanics and car handling, as well as the varied cars featured. He considered it as a leap forward from ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]'', but criticized the tracks for being \"snapshots of a certain time of day and temperature\" and concluded that the track conditions are \"baked in\". Nevertheless, he called it one of the best racing games for consoles.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nMiguel Concepcion from [[GameSpot]] praised the Drivatar system and the Driving Mods, as he thought that they have added more variety to races. He praised the system that rewards players using challenging settings with a corresponding number of credits and applauded the multiplayer modes featured in the game, which he thought suit the style of all kind of players, both new and old, but criticized the pre- and post-race visuals and replays for running at fewer than 60 frames per second. He also lauded the [[artificial intelligence]] for being \"unpredictable\".<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> However, Matthew Kato from ''[[Game Informer]]'' felt that the weather system was exaggerated, and added that they may take away the fun of some races, and the overhauled career mode, which he described as \"somewhere between those in ''Forza 5'' and ''[[Forza 4]]''\" is not engaging enough for most players. However, he praised the number of cars and tracks featured, as well as its high replay value.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Justin Towell from [[GamesRadar]] criticized the game's slow-paced career mode, as he felt that it has failed to deliver an intense experience. He also felt the handling was \"odd\" and the Drivatar system was \"inconsistent\". However, he praised the rich content featured, and added that by comparison, ''Forza 6'' makes ''Forza 5'' to look like a game demo instead of a full game.<ref name=\"GRadar\" />\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | List of awards and nominations\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Award\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Category\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Result\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" | Ref.\n|-\n| [[The Game Awards 2015]]\n| Best Sports/Racing Game\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"TGA: won\">{{cite web|url=http://thegameawards.com/nominees/ |title=Nominees {{!}} The Game Awards 2015 |date=November 12, 2015 |website=[[The Game Awards]] |publisher=[[Ola Balola]] |accessdate=November 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114024126/http://thegameawards.com/nominees/ |archivedate=November 14, 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 19th Annual DICE Awards\n| Racing Game of the Year\n| {{won}}\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2016-dice-award-winners-updated/1100-6434830/|title=The 2016 DICE Award Winners [UPDATED]|first=Chris|last=Pereira|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.forzamotorsport.net/games/fm6 Official website]\n* {{MobyGames|id=/forza-motorsport-6|name=Forza Motorsport 6}}\n\n{{Forza series}}\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:2015 video games]]\n[[Category:Forza series]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Split-screen multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n<!--TO DO track locations by state/country:-->\n[[Category:Video games set in Australia]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Video games set in England]]\n[[Category:Video games set in France]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Indianapolis]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Miami]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Spain]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Arab Emirates]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "name_user": "41.113.168.23", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eGameplay)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Motorsport_6"}

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the lack of chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Alberta]] to raise Anna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

It stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a Canadian intelligence officer and [[Marion Cotillard]] as a [[French Resistance]] fighter and collaborator who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in [[Casablanca]]. [[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\nKnight first began developing the story after hearing the story told to him as a 21 year old man. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London, and would also film in the [[Canary Islands]], used to stand in for [[Morocco]]. [[Joanna Johnston]] acted as costume designer for the film, and would match the designs of the costumes around the character's mindset and situations.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 23, 2016 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its costume design, but saw criticism for its screenplay and the lack of chemistry between the actors. The film grossed $40.1 million domestic and $119 million worldwide against an approximate $85\u2013113 million budget, becoming regarded as a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]]. At the [[89th Academy Awards]], it would receive a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high [[treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefiant, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Alberta]] to raise Anna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

It is also possible to hydraulically lift the front and rear axles of the car to give additional ground clearance. The doors have been redesigned so that they open further outward and have more ground clearance while open.

The high-downforce variant, as shown at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2019|2019 Geneva Motor Show]], comes equipped with the dual front and rear 'Triplex' damper system and added aerodynamic features for track use.<ref name=\"R&T\"/> Due to this dual suspension setup, it is not possible to store the Targa roof in the front of the car, although this is possible in the Absolut as it will not have a front 'Triplex' damper system or front hood air dam.<ref name=\"ma\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Variants==\n===Jesko Absolut===\nUnveiled online alongside the [[Koenigsegg Gemera|Gemera]] on 3 March 2020, the Jesko Absolut is a high speed version of the Jesko and the fastest car made by Koenigsegg. The rear wing on the track-oriented Jesko is replaced by two rear fins which enable a reduction in downforce from {{convert|1400|kg|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|150|kg|0|abbr=on}} and a drag coefficient of {{Cd|long=no|0.278}}. The front splitter and side winglets are removed and the front louvers are smoother with the rear wheels featuring removable covers for high speed stability. The vehicle is also slightly elongated featuring a rear extension which adds {{convert|85|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of additional length. The engine and transmission remain the same as the standard Jesko. 3,000 hours were spent on the aerodynamic analysis while an additional 5,000 hours were spent design and engineering work of the Absolut. The Absolut will be priced higher than the Jesko due to the development work taken to lower the drag coefficient. The Jesko Absolut is claimed by the manufacturer to have a top speed in excess of {{cvt|300|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the right conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/koenigsegg-jesko-absolut-supercar-speed-power-geneva/|title=Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: This supercar has a date with 300 mph|work=[[CNET|Roadshow by CNET]]|last=Szymkowski|first=Sean|date=3 March 2020|accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a31246635/koenigsegg-absolut-top-speed-test-possibiltiy/|title=The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut Can Do 330 MPH in Theory, But it Needs Space|date=5 March 2020|first=Chris|last=Perkins|publisher=[[Road & Track]]|accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/402028/koenigsegg-jesko-absolut/|title=Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut Revealed As The Fastest Car Koenigsegg Would Ever Make|date=3 March 2020|first=Adrian|last=Padeanu|publisher=Motor1|accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Koenigsegg Jesko}}\n* {{Official website | https://www.koenigsegg.com/car/jesko/ }}\n\n{{Koenigsegg}}\n{{Koenigsegg road car timeline, 1990s-present}}\n\n[[Category:Koenigsegg vehicles|Jesko]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2019]]\n[[Category:Flagship vehicles]]\n[[Category:2020s cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Mid-engine hypercar manufactured by Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg as a successor to the Agera}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = GIMS 2019, Le Grand-Saconnex (GIMS0833).jpg\n| caption = Pre-production model at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show\n| name = Koenigsegg Jesko\n| manufacturer = [[Koenigsegg|Koenigsegg Automotive AB]]\n| aka = \n| production = 2020 (expected)\n| assembly = [[\u00c4ngelholm]], Sweden\n| predecessor = [[Koenigsegg Agera]]\n| successor = \n| doors = [[Dihedral doors|Dihedral]]\n| class = [[Sports car]] ([[S-segment|S]])<!-- per WP:CARCLASS, this should not be changed to \"supercar\" or \"hypercar\" -->\n| body_style = 2-door [[targa top]]\n| layout = [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| platform = \n| engine = {{convert|5032|cc|L cc cuin|abbr=on|1|order=out}} [[twin-turbocharged]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| powerout = {{cvt|955|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} (normal [[Gasoline|gasoline]])<br>{{cvt|1195|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} ([[E85]])\n| transmission = 9-speed [[Non-synchronous transmission|multi-clutch]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2700|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"koenigseggweb\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.koenigsegg.com/car/jesko/|title=Jesko - Koenigsegg|date=5 March 2019 |website=Koenigsegg|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n| length = {{convert|4610|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"koenigseggweb\"/>\n| width = {{convert|2030|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"koenigseggweb\"/>\n| height = {{convert|1210|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"koenigseggweb\"/>\n| weight = {{convert|1420|kg|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"WC\"/>\n| designer = [[Christian von Koenigsegg]]<br>Joachim Nordwall\n}}\n\nThe '''Koenigsegg Jesko''' is a limited production mid-engine [[sports car]] produced by Swedish automobile manufacturer [[Koenigsegg]].

The front splitter and side winglets are removed and the front louvers are smoother with the rear wheels featuring removable covers for high speed stability. The vehicle is also slightly elongated featuring a rear extension which adds {{convert|85|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of additional length. The engine and transmission remain the same as the standard Jesko. 3,000 hours were spent on the aerodynamic analysis while an additional 5,000 hours were spent design and engineering work of the Absolut. The Absolut will be priced higher than the Jesko due to the development work taken to lower the drag coefficient.

After being signed by the Canadiens in 1910, V\u00e9zina played in 327 consecutive regular season games and a further 39 playoff games, before leaving early during a game in 1925 due to illness. V\u00e9zina was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], and died on {{Nowrap|March 27}}, 1926.\n\nThe only [[goaltender]] to play for the Canadiens between 1910 and 1925, V\u00e9zina helped the team win the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1916 Stanley Cup Finals|1916]] and [[1924 Stanley Cup Finals|1924]], while reaching the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] three more times. Nicknamed the \"Chicoutimi Cucumber\" for his calm composure while in goal, V\u00e9zina allowed the fewest goals in the league seven times in his career: four times in the NHA and three times in the NHL. In 1918, V\u00e9zina became the first NHL goaltender to both record a shutout and earn an assist on a goal. At the start of the [[1926\u201327 NHL season]], the Canadiens donated the [[Vezina Trophy]] to the NHL as an award to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals during the season. Since 1981, the award has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as determined by a vote of NHL general managers. In V\u00e9zina's hometown of Chicoutimi, the sports arena is named the [[Centre Georges-V\u00e9zina]] in his honour. When the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] opened in 1945, V\u00e9zina was one of the original nine inductees, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their list of the [[100 Greatest NHL Players|100 greatest players in league history]].\n\n==Personal life==\nGeorges, the youngest of eight children, was born on {{Nowrap|January 21}}, 1887, in [[Chicoutimi]], [[Quebec]], to Jacques V\u00e9zina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara.<ref>{{harvnb|Falla|2008|p=141}}</ref> Georges attended school at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{Citation|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7979&interval=20&&PHPSESSID=alkcc4d9686rh2slqkvvvvtfj1|title=Georges V\u00e9zina Page|accessdate=2008-11-27|publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|year=2000|author=Vigneault, Michel}}</ref> He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age.<ref name=\"Jenish 2008 pp=34\u201335\">{{harvnb|Jenish|2008|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> V\u00e9zina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates for the first time at age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi.<ref name=\"One on One with Georges Vezina\">{{Citation|url=https://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononep194512.shtml|title=One on One with Georges Vezina|accessdate=2008-11-24|publisher=Legends of Hockey|date=2008-11-07|author=Shea, Kevin}}</ref> As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of [[Quebec]], more than 200 kilometres from [[Quebec City]], the hockey club was not in any organised league.

After being signed by the Canadiens in 1910, V\u00e9zina played in 327 consecutive regular season games and a further 39 playoff games, before leaving early during a game in 1925 due to illness. V\u00e9zina was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], and died on {{Nowrap|March 27}}, 1926.\n\nThe only [[goaltender]] to play for the Canadiens between 1910 and 1925, V\u00e9zina helped the team win the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1916 Stanley Cup Finals|1916]] and [[1924 Stanley Cup Finals|1924]], while reaching the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] three more times. Nicknamed the \"Chicoutimi Cucumber\" for his calm composure while in goal, V\u00e9zina allowed the fewest goals in the league seven times in his career: four times in the NHA and three times in the NHL. In 1918, V\u00e9zina became the first NHL goaltender to both record a shutout and earn an assist on a goal. At the start of the [[1926\u201327 NHL season]], the Canadiens donated the [[Vezina Trophy]] to the NHL as an award to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals during the season. Since 1981, the award has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as determined by a vote of NHL general managers. In V\u00e9zina's hometown of Chicoutimi, the sports arena is named the [[Centre Georges-V\u00e9zina]] in his honour. When the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] opened in 1945, V\u00e9zina was one of the original nine inductees, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their list of the [[100 Greatest NHL Players|100 greatest players in league history]].\n\n==Personal life==\nGeorges, the youngest of eight children, was born on {{Nowrap|January 21}}, 1887, in [[Chicoutimi]], [[Quebec]], to Jacques V\u00e9zina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara.<ref>{{harvnb|Falla|2008|p=141}}</ref> Georges attended school at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{Citation|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7979&interval=20&&PHPSESSID=alkcc4d9686rh2slqkvvvvtfj1|title=Georges V\u00e9zina Page|accessdate=2008-11-27|publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|year=2000|author=Vigneault, Michel}}</ref> He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age.<ref name=\"Jenish 2008 pp=34\u201335\">{{harvnb|Jenish|2008|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> V\u00e9zina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates for the first time at age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi.<ref name=\"One on One with Georges Vezina\">{{Citation|url=https://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononep194512.shtml|title=One on One with Georges Vezina|accessdate=2008-11-24|publisher=Legends of Hockey|date=2008-11-07|author=Shea, Kevin}}</ref> As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of [[Quebec]], more than 200 kilometres from [[Quebec City]], the hockey club was not in any organised league.

''Better Than Chocolate'' ranked 31 on \"The Hollywood Reporter\"'s list of best independent films. The \"[[Chicago Tribune]]\" review declared that the ''highlight of the movie is unquestionably Dwyer's performance as Maggie''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nAlso that year, Dwyer played Summer Falls in the bigger budget [[List of Hollywood movie studios|studio]] film ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'', playing opposite [[Molly Shannon]] and [[Will Ferrell]] and produced by [[Lorne Michaels]].

A professional MMA competitor since 2000, Noons has also formerly competed for [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]], [[EliteXC]], and is the former [[Elite Xtreme Combat#EliteXC Champions|EliteXC Lightweight Champion]].\n\n==Background==\nKJ Noons is [[hapa|hapa kanaka, hapa haole]]\u2014mixed ethnicity of native Hawaiian (from his mother's side) and European-American (from his father's side).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG5R2XcyX7M|title=KJ Noons: I Am a Fighter - SHOWTIME Sports - Strikeforce MMA - Noons vs. Masvidal|publisher=Showtime Sports via YouTube.com}}</ref> Born and raised in [[Kailua-Kona, Hawaii]], Noons comes from a family history of fighting. His father Karl was a professional kickboxer and was a top contender during the time he fought. Karl's passion for fighting and competing in [[combat sports]] influenced him to introduce his son to [[martial arts]] at a young age. At the age of five, Noons started training in [[American Kenpo|Kenp\u014d Karate]]. Often getting disqualified for fighting too hard in [[karate]] tournaments, Noons eventually started training in [[boxing]] and [[Muay Thai]] at the age of eight out of interest for full contact fighting.<ref name=\"KJBio\"/> Noons competed as an amateur fighter and became the first student in the state of Hawaii to earn a junior black belt under [[Ed Parker]] at the age of 11. During his high school years, Noons moved to [[Houston, Texas]] due to the location of his father's job. While continuing to compete as a fighter, he also started playing football at [[Clements High School]]. At age 17, Noons won the ISKA Super Middleweight International Championship as an amateur in [[Sanshou]]. After winning the title and graduating from Clements High School, K.J. decided to pursue a career in combat sports, rather than go to college and continue with football.<ref name=\"KJBio\"/>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===PRIDE, ICON Sport, and SuperBrawl===\nIn 2005, Noons won the [[PRIDE Fighting Championship]]'s \"Best Striker\" auditions. Although, he never fought for the promotion, he fought for [[PRIDE Fighting Championships|PRIDE]]'s subleased promotion called SuperBrawl. Noons chose not to fight for PRIDE Fighting Championships because the promoters wanted to feature him in bouts against the top lightweights in the world, such as PRIDE's reigning [[List of Pride Champions|Lightweight Champion]], [[Takanori Gomi]], and top contender, [[Joachim Hansen (fighter)|Joachim Hansen]]. Noons felt he was not ready to compete at the highest level that early in his career and chose a more conservative route. After three combined wins under the ICON Sport and SuperBrawl banner, Noons would move on to compete in bigger promotions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uscombatsports.com/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=212&id=7682&Itemid=298|title=KJ Noons Feels At Home Preparing In Houston|author=AJ Hoffman|publisher=US Combat Sports}}</ref>\n\n===Elite Xtreme Combat===\nIn 2006, Noons signed a deal with promoter Gary Shaw that allowed him to participate in both boxing and mixed martial arts. Soon after, Noons was set to face former [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] veteran [[Charles Bennett (fighter)|Charles Bennett]] in [[EliteXC]]'s inaugural event in February 2007. Bennett won the bout via KO three minutes and forty-three seconds into round one, giving Noons only the second loss of his professional [[mixed martial arts]] career.\n\nNoons rebounded from his loss to Bennett with a KO win over James Edson Berto at EliteXC's first [[ShoXC]] event. He then faced [[Nick Diaz]] for the promotion's first ever lightweight championship at [[EliteXC: Renegade]]. Noons dominated the fight using his outstanding boxing and striking against the [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] expert. Diaz attempted to take the fight to the ground but was unsuccessful with his takedown attempts and was also countered with a knee strike to the face on one occasion. Midway through the first round, Diaz was finally successful with a take down, but Noons got back to his feet instantly. Moments later, the referee would halt the fight and send Diaz to his corner to check on his cuts over his right eye. Diaz was given the o.k. and continued to fight. Noons would keep the fight standing and dropped Diaz with a straight right punch around the 2:07 mark of the round. After round one ended, the doctors in Diaz's corner stopped the fight due to how badly his face was cut. Noons was then be declared the winner of the fight by way of TKO due to cuts, and would become the new [[Elite Xtreme Combat#EliteXC Champions|EliteXC Lightweight Champion]].\n\nOn June 14, 2008 Noons was successful in his first and only title defense with a TKO win over [[Yves Edwards]] in Hawaii at [[EliteXC: Return of the King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/4010/elitexcs-hawaii-event-postponed-to-june.mma|title=EliteXC's Hawaii Event Postponed to June|publisher=MMAjunkie}}</ref> Following the fight, Nick Diaz, who fought on the event's co-main event, stepped into the cage to confront Noons for a rematch during K.J.'s post-fight interview with [[Bill Goldberg]]. After Noons asked the fans if Diaz deserved the rematch, Diaz grabbed a hold of Goldberg's microphone and said \"Don't be scared homie\", which resulted in an in-cage brawl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prommanow.com/index.php/2008/06/16/nick-diazs-words-to-daddy-noons-elite-xcs-promotion-tactics/|title=Nick Diaz's Words To Daddy Noons & Elite XC's Promotion Tactics|author=Jack Bratcher|publisher=Pro MMA Now}}</ref> About two months later, Noons would be stripped of the title for refusing to rematch with Diaz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/5325/elitexc-lightweight-champion-kj-noons-stripped-of-title.mma|title=EliteXC lightweight champion KJ Noons stripped of title|publisher=MMAjunkie}}</ref> The promotion would then go defunct before a new champion could be crowned.\n\n===Strikeforce and DREAM===\nOn December 2, 2009, Noons signed with mixed martial arts promotion, [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Strikeforce-Signs-Noons-21256|title=Strikeforce Signs Noons|author=Loretta Hunt|publisher=Sherdog}}</ref> While Noons was still competing in professional kickboxing as a teenager, he previously fought for Strikeforce on their kickboxing fight cards before Strikeforce became a mixed martial arts promotion in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/14332/former-elitexc-champ-k-j-noons-drops-decision-in-weekend-boxing-bout.mma|title=Former EliteXC champ K.J.

In his first MMA fight in nearly two years, Noons defeated [[Andre Amade]] via unanimous decision. Noons was the aggressor for the duration of the fight, and was visibly frustrated with Amade's uncharacteristically tentative fighting style throughout the fight, which seemed to be based on a counter punching technique.\n\nNoons was set to make his Strikeforce debut against undefeated prospect [[Billy Evangelista]] at [[Strikeforce: Miami]], but the fight was withdrawn after Evangelista suffered an undisclosed injury during training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/01/05/kj-noons-vs-billy-evangelista-off-strikeforce-miami|title=KJ Noons vs. Billy Evangelista Off Strikeforce: Miami|author=Ariel Helwani|publisher=MMA Fighting}}</ref>\n\nNoons would then be scheduled to compete in a rematch against [[Charles Bennett (fighter)|Charles Bennett]] at [[Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Werdum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Noons-Bennett-Rematch-Set-for-June-26-Strikeforce-24602|title=Noons-Bennett Rematch Set for June 26 Strikeforce|author=Loretta Hunt|publisher=Sherdog}}</ref> After Bennett pulled out of the fight due to scheduling conflicts, Noons was rescheduled to face [[Conor Heun]] at [[Strikeforce: Los Angeles]] in a [[Catch weight|catchweight]] bout of 160 pounds, which would take place ten days before the date he was originally set to rematch Bennett.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heavy.com/mma/mma-news/2010/06/kj-noons-vs-conor-heun-booked-for-strikeforce-l-a/|title=KJ Noons vs. Conor Heun Booked For Strikeforce: L.A.|author=Nate Lawson|publisher=Heavy}}</ref> Noons would go on to win a closely contested fight by split decision.\n\nNoons next faced [[Jorge Gurgel]] on August 21, 2010 at [[Strikeforce: Houston]]. At the weigh-ins, the day before the bout with Gurgel, Noons weighed in at 156.25 pounds, a quarter of a pound over the maximum weight limit. Gurgel accepted the fight and waived off the extra weight, so the fight was continued as a lightweight bout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/08/20/strikeforce-houston-weigh-in-video|title=Strikeforce: Houston Weigh-In Video|author=Ariel Helwani|publisher=MMA Fighting}}</ref> As the final seconds of the first round were coming to an end, Gurgel threw a flurry of punches while Noons responded with a left hook that landed and dropped Gurgel just a split second after the bell sounded at the end of the round. The crowd reacted to what appeared to be a late punch while a wobbled Gurgel was struggling to find his corner. Right at the opening bell for round two, Noons landed a right hand followed by a left hook that dropped Gurgel to the canvas once again. Noons looked to the referee expecting a stoppage and received no response. As Noons then continued to land punches on Gurgel, he threw a knee that appeared to land to the head of a still downed opponent, finally prompting the referee to stop the fight. Replay showed that the knee Noons threw did not land, although Noons's foot tapped Gurgel on the chin as it followed through. Noons was declared the winner by TKO at 0:19 of round two.\n\nNoons moved up one weight class to fight [[Nick Diaz]] in a grudge rematch for the [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Welterweight Championship]] on October 9, 2010. Noons and Diaz previously fought at [[EliteXC: Renegade]] where Noons won by TKO due to cuts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/10/06/nick-diaz-still-trying-to-finish-what-he-started-with-k-j-noons|title=Nick Diaz Still Trying to Finish What He Started With K.J.

A professional MMA competitor since 2000, Noons has also formerly competed for [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]], [[EliteXC]], and is the former [[Elite Xtreme Combat#EliteXC Champions|EliteXC Lightweight Champion]].\n\n==Background==\nKJ Noons is [[hapa|hapa kanaka, hapa haole]]\u2014mixed ethnicity of native Hawaiian (from his mother's side) and European-American (from his father's side).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG5R2XcyX7M|title=KJ Noons: I Am a Fighter - SHOWTIME Sports - Strikeforce MMA - Noons vs. Masvidal|publisher=Showtime Sports via YouTube.com}}</ref> Born and raised in [[Kailua-Kona, Hawaii]], Noons comes from a family history of fighting. His father Karl was a professional kickboxer and was a top contender during the time he fought. Karl's passion for fighting and competing in [[combat sports]] influenced him to introduce his son to [[martial arts]] at a young age. At the age of five, Noons started training in [[American Kenpo|Kenp\u014d Karate]]. Often getting disqualified for fighting too hard in [[karate]] tournaments, Noons eventually started training in [[boxing]] and [[Muay Thai]] at the age of eight out of interest for full contact fighting.<ref name=\"KJBio\"/> Noons competed as an amateur fighter and became the first student in the state of Hawaii to earn a junior black belt under [[Ed Parker]] at the age of 11. During his high school years, Noons moved to [[Houston, Texas]] due to the location of his father's job. While continuing to compete as a fighter, he also started playing football at [[Clements High School]]. At age 17, Noons won the ISKA Super Middleweight International Championship as an amateur in [[Sanshou]]. After winning the title and graduating from Clements High School, K.J. decided to pursue a career in combat sports, rather than go to college and continue with football.<ref name=\"KJBio\"/>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===PRIDE, ICON Sport, and SuperBrawl===\nIn 2005, Noons won the [[PRIDE Fighting Championship]]'s \"Best Striker\" auditions. Although, he never fought for the promotion, he fought for [[PRIDE Fighting Championships|PRIDE]]'s subleased promotion called SuperBrawl. Noons chose not to fight for PRIDE Fighting Championships because the promoters wanted to feature him in bouts against the top lightweights in the world, such as PRIDE's reigning [[List of Pride Champions|Lightweight Champion]], [[Takanori Gomi]], and top contender, [[Joachim Hansen (fighter)|Joachim Hansen]]. Noons felt he was not ready to compete at the highest level that early in his career and chose a more conservative route. After three combined wins under the ICON Sport and SuperBrawl banner, Noons would move on to compete in bigger promotions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uscombatsports.com/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=212&id=7682&Itemid=298|title=KJ Noons Feels At Home Preparing In Houston|author=AJ Hoffman|publisher=US Combat Sports}}</ref>\n\n===Elite Xtreme Combat===\nIn 2006, Noons signed a deal with promoter [[Gary Shaw]] that allowed him to participate in both boxing and mixed martial arts. Soon after, Noons was set to face former [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] veteran [[Charles Bennett (fighter)|Charles Bennett]] in [[EliteXC]]'s inaugural event in February 2007. Bennett won the bout via KO three minutes and forty-three seconds into round one, giving Noons only the second loss of his professional [[mixed martial arts]] career.\n\nNoons rebounded from his loss to Bennett with a KO win over James Edson Berto at EliteXC's first [[ShoXC]] event. He then faced [[Nick Diaz]] for the promotion's first ever lightweight championship at [[EliteXC: Renegade]]. Noons dominated the fight using his outstanding boxing and striking against the [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] expert. Diaz attempted to take the fight to the ground but was unsuccessful with his takedown attempts and was also countered with a knee strike to the face on one occasion. Midway through the first round, Diaz was finally successful with a take down, but Noons got back to his feet instantly. Moments later, the referee would halt the fight and send Diaz to his corner to check on his cuts over his right eye. Diaz was given the o.k. and continued to fight. Noons would keep the fight standing and dropped Diaz with a straight right punch around the 2:07 mark of the round. After round one ended, the doctors in Diaz's corner stopped the fight due to how badly his face was cut. Noons was then be declared the winner of the fight by way of TKO due to cuts, and would become the new [[Elite Xtreme Combat#EliteXC Champions|EliteXC Lightweight Champion]].\n\nOn June 14, 2008 Noons was successful in his first and only title defense with a TKO win over [[Yves Edwards]] in Hawaii at [[EliteXC: Return of the King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/4010/elitexcs-hawaii-event-postponed-to-june.mma|title=EliteXC's Hawaii Event Postponed to June|publisher=MMAjunkie}}</ref> Following the fight, Nick Diaz, who fought on the event's co-main event, stepped into the cage to confront Noons for a rematch during K.J.'s post-fight interview with [[Bill Goldberg]]. After Noons asked the fans if Diaz deserved the rematch, Diaz grabbed a hold of Goldberg's microphone and said \"Don't be scared homie\", which resulted in an in-cage brawl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prommanow.com/index.php/2008/06/16/nick-diazs-words-to-daddy-noons-elite-xcs-promotion-tactics/|title=Nick Diaz's Words To Daddy Noons & Elite XC's Promotion Tactics|author=Jack Bratcher|publisher=Pro MMA Now}}</ref> About two months later, Noons would be stripped of the title for refusing to rematch with Diaz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/5325/elitexc-lightweight-champion-kj-noons-stripped-of-title.mma|title=EliteXC lightweight champion KJ Noons stripped of title|publisher=MMAjunkie}}</ref> The promotion would then go defunct before a new champion could be crowned.\n\n===Strikeforce and DREAM===\nOn December 2, 2009, Noons signed with mixed martial arts promotion, [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Strikeforce-Signs-Noons-21256|title=Strikeforce Signs Noons|author=Loretta Hunt|publisher=Sherdog}}</ref> While Noons was still competing in professional kickboxing as a teenager, he previously fought for Strikeforce on their kickboxing fight cards before Strikeforce became a mixed martial arts promotion in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/14332/former-elitexc-champ-k-j-noons-drops-decision-in-weekend-boxing-bout.mma|title=Former EliteXC champ K.J.

In his first MMA fight in nearly two years, Noons defeated [[Andre Amade]] via unanimous decision. Noons was the aggressor for the duration of the fight, and was visibly frustrated with Amade's uncharacteristically tentative fighting style throughout the fight, which seemed to be based on a counter punching technique.\n\nNoons was set to make his Strikeforce debut against undefeated prospect [[Billy Evangelista]] at [[Strikeforce: Miami]], but the fight was withdrawn after Evangelista suffered an undisclosed injury during training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/01/05/kj-noons-vs-billy-evangelista-off-strikeforce-miami|title=KJ Noons vs. Billy Evangelista Off Strikeforce: Miami|author=Ariel Helwani|publisher=MMA Fighting}}</ref>\n\nNoons would then be scheduled to compete in a rematch against [[Charles Bennett (fighter)|Charles Bennett]] at [[Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Werdum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Noons-Bennett-Rematch-Set-for-June-26-Strikeforce-24602|title=Noons-Bennett Rematch Set for June 26 Strikeforce|author=Loretta Hunt|publisher=Sherdog}}</ref> After Bennett pulled out of the fight due to scheduling conflicts, Noons was rescheduled to face [[Conor Heun]] at [[Strikeforce: Los Angeles]] in a [[Catch weight|catchweight]] bout of 160 pounds, which would take place ten days before the date he was originally set to rematch Bennett.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heavy.com/mma/mma-news/2010/06/kj-noons-vs-conor-heun-booked-for-strikeforce-l-a/|title=KJ Noons vs. Conor Heun Booked For Strikeforce: L.A.|author=Nate Lawson|publisher=Heavy}}</ref> Noons would go on to win a closely contested fight by split decision.\n\nNoons next faced [[Jorge Gurgel]] on August 21, 2010 at [[Strikeforce: Houston]]. At the weigh-ins, the day before the bout with Gurgel, Noons weighed in at 156.25 pounds, a quarter of a pound over the maximum weight limit. Gurgel accepted the fight and waived off the extra weight, so the fight was continued as a lightweight bout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/08/20/strikeforce-houston-weigh-in-video|title=Strikeforce: Houston Weigh-In Video|author=Ariel Helwani|publisher=MMA Fighting}}</ref> As the final seconds of the first round were coming to an end, Gurgel threw a flurry of punches while Noons responded with a left hook that landed and dropped Gurgel just a split second after the bell sounded at the end of the round. The crowd reacted to what appeared to be a late punch while a wobbled Gurgel was struggling to find his corner. Right at the opening bell for round two, Noons landed a right hand followed by a left hook that dropped Gurgel to the canvas once again. Noons looked to the referee expecting a stoppage and received no response. As Noons then continued to land punches on Gurgel, he threw a knee that appeared to land to the head of a still downed opponent, finally prompting the referee to stop the fight. Replay showed that the knee Noons threw did not land, although Noons's foot tapped Gurgel on the chin as it followed through. Noons was declared the winner by TKO at 0:19 of round two.\n\nNoons moved up one weight class to fight [[Nick Diaz]] in a grudge rematch for the [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Welterweight Championship]] on October 9, 2010.

Roosevelt]]. The [[Great Depression]] continued and voters backed progressive candidates favoring Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] in races across the country. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] gained 5 net seats during the election, and in combination with Democratic and [[Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Farmer\u2013Labor]] interim appointments and the defection of [[George W. Norris]] from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] to become [[Independent (politician)|independent]], the Republicans were reduced to 16 seats, the most lopsided Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\n== Gains and Losses ==\n\nThe Republicans took one open seat in Massachusetts, while the Democrats took open seats in Michigan and New Hampshire and defeated incumbents [[Daniel O. Hastings]] (R-DE), [[Lester J. Dickinson]] (R-IA), [[W. Warren Barbour]] (R-NJ), [[Jesse H. Metcalf]] (R-RI), and [[Robert D. Carey]] (R-WY).\n\n* Republicans gained one Democratic open seat:\n# [[#Massachusetts|Massachusetts]]\n\n* Democrats gained one Republican open seat:\n# [[#Colorado|Colorado]]\n# [[#Michigan|Michigan]] (incumbent died, leaving seat vacant)\n\n* Democrats held an open seat:\n# [[#Louisiana|Louisiana]]\n# [[#Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]\n\n* Farmer\u2013Laborers held an open seat:\n# [[#Minnesota|Minnesota]]\n\n* Republicans held an open seat:\n# [[#New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]\n\n* Republican incumbents lost five elections\n# [[#Delaware|Delaware]]\n# [[#Iowa|Iowa]]\n# [[#New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n# [[#Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]\n# [[#Wyoming|Wyoming]]\n\n* One Republican was re-elected, but changed party to become an Independent:\n# [[#Nebraska|Nebraska]]\n\n== Milestones ==\n\nThis was the last of four consecutive elections where Republicans suffered losses due to the ongoing effects of the Great Depression.  This was also the last Senate election in the 20th century in which a Democratic candidate who won two terms also made net gains in the Senate on both occasions (although Franklin Roosevelt won a third and fourth term, he lost Senate seats on both occasions).\n\n== Change in Senate composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\nGoing into the November 1936 elections.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

Roosevelt]]. The [[Great Depression]] continued and voters backed progressive candidates favoring Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] in races across the country. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] gained 5 net seats during the election, and in combination with Democratic and [[Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Farmer\u2013Labor]] interim appointments and the defection of [[George W. Norris]] from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] to become [[Independent (politician)|independent]], the Republicans were reduced to 16 seats, the most lopsided Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\n== Gains and Losses ==\n\nThe Republicans took one open seat in Massachusetts, while the Democrats took open seats in Michigan and New Hampshire and defeated incumbents [[Daniel O. Hastings]] (R-DE), [[Lester J. Dickinson]] (R-IA), [[W. Warren Barbour]] (R-NJ), [[Jesse H. Metcalf]] (R-RI), and [[Robert D. Carey]] (R-WY).\n\n* Republicans gained one Democratic open seat:\n# [[#Massachusetts|Massachusetts]]\n\n* Democrats gained one Republican open seat:\n# [[#Colorado|Colorado]]\n# [[#Michigan|Michigan]] (incumbent died, leaving seat vacant)\n\n* Democrats held an open seat:\n# [[#Louisiana|Louisiana]]\n# [[#Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]\n\n* Farmer\u2013Laborers held an open seat:\n# [[#Minnesota|Minnesota]]\n\n* Republicans held an open seat:\n# [[#New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]\n\n* Republican incumbents lost five elections\n# [[#Delaware|Delaware]]\n# [[#Iowa|Iowa]]\n# [[#New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n# [[#Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]\n# [[#Wyoming|Wyoming]]\n\n* One Republican was re-elected, but changed party to become an Independent:\n# [[#Nebraska|Nebraska]]\n\n== Milestones ==\n\nThis was the last of four consecutive elections where Republicans suffered losses due to the ongoing effects of the Great Depression.  This was also the last Senate election in the 20th century in which a Democratic candidate who won two terms also made net gains in the Senate on both occasions (although Franklin Roosevelt won a third and fourth term, he lost Senate seats on both occasions).\n\n== Change in Senate composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\nGoing into the November 1936 elections.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

Co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], the film features human characters animated using live-action [[motion capture]] animation. The film tells the story of a young boy who, on [[Christmas Eve]], sees a mysterious train bound for the [[North Pole]] stop outside his window and is invited aboard by its conductor. The boy joins several other children as they embark on a journey to visit Santa Claus preparing for Christmas. The film stars [[Tom Hanks]], who was also one of the film's executive producers, in multiple distinct roles, with [[Daryl Sabara]], [[Nona Gaye]], [[Jimmy Bennett]] and [[Eddie Deezen]] in supporting roles. The film also includes a performance by [[Tinashe]] at age 9, as the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model for the female protagonist.\n\n[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] produced the film in association with [[Shangri-La Entertainment]], [[ImageMovers]], [[Playtone]] and Golden Mean Productions for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], as Castle Rock's first animated film. The visual effects and performance capture were done at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]. The film was made with a production budget of $165 million, a record-breaking sum for an animated feature at the time.\n\n''The Polar Express'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] theaters on November 10, 2004. The film grossed $311.3 million worldwide, and was later listed in the 2006 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the first all-digital capture film. It also marks [[Michael Jeter]]'s last acting role before his death, and the film was thus dedicated to his memory.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Review: 'The Polar Express'|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|access-date=December 10, 2014|work=Variety|date=October 24, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226224253/http://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|archive-date=December 26, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], on the night of Christmas Eve, a boy becomes skeptical of the existence of Santa Claus. Struggling to fall asleep, he witnesses a steam locomotive arrive on the street, and goes outside to examine it. The conductor introduces the train as the Polar Express, bound for the North Pole. Initially reluctant, the boy jumps aboard as the train departs.\n\nIn a passenger car, he meets a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy. The train picks up a boy named Billy, who also declines to board, but changes his mind, and the boy applies the brakes to allow Billy to board, which is noticed by the conductor. As Billy sits alone in the train's [[observation car]], hot chocolate is served in the passenger car, and the girl stows away a cup for Billy. As she and the conductor cross to the dining car, the boy notices that she left her unpunched ticket, but loses hold of the ticket between the cars when he attempts to return it. The ticket reenters the passenger car, but not before the conductor notices its absence and escorts the girl back to the rear car.\n\nWhen the know-it-all claims the conductor will throw the girl from the train, the boy recovers the ticket and dashes to the dining car in search of the conductor, climbing onto the roof. He meets a hobo camping on the roof, who offers him coffee and discusses the existence of Santa Claus and ghosts. The hobo skis with the boy along the tops of the cars toward the [[tender (rail)|coal tender]], where the hobo disappears right at Flat Top Tunnel. \n\nIn the locomotive's cab, the boy discovers that the girl has been made to supervise driving the train while the engineers Steamer and Smokey replace the headlight. \n\nThe boy applies the brakes and the train stops coming across a herd of [[caribou]] blocking the tracks. The conductor pulls Smokey's beard, causing him to let out animal-like noises, and the caribou herd strolls away. \n\nThe train continues on at extreme speed, and the throttle's [[split pin]] (cotter pin) shears off, causing the train to accelerate uncontrollably down a 179-degree grade and onto a frozen lake. Smokey uses his hairpin to repair the throttle as the train drifts across the ice to realign with the tracks moments before the ice breaks.\n\nThe boy returns the girl's ticket for the conductor to punch, and as the three return to the passenger car, the Hobo uses a Scrooge puppet, taunting the boy and calling hima doubter.\n\nThe train arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one of the passengers will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa himself. \n\nDiscovering Billy still alone in the observation car, the girl and boy persuade him to come along, but the boy accidentally uncouples the car, sending it back along the line to a [[railway turntable]] in Santa's workshop. \n\nThe children make their way through an elf command center and a gift sorting office before being dumped into a giant sack of presents, where they discover that the know-it-all has stowed away, and the elves escort them out as Santa arrives. \n\nA bell flies loose from the galloping reindeer's reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. He shows the bell to Santa, who selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas. Santa agrees to let him keep the bell, and the boy places it in his robe pocket.\n\nThe rear car is returned to the train as the children board to return home, but the boy discovers that he lost the bell through the hole in his pocket. \n\nHe returns home and awakens Christmas morning to find a present containing the bell. He and his younger sister Sarah joyfully ring the bell, while their parents, not believing in Santa, say that the bell is broken. \n\nThe boy reflects on his friends and sister growing deaf to the bell as their belief faded. However, the bell still rings for him, as it will \"for all who truly believe\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michael Jeter at the 44th Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|175px|right|thumb|This film marks the final performance of actor [[Michael Jeter]]; Jeter died the year before the film's release.]]\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Hero Boy {{ref|mocap|I}}, Hero Boy's father, Conductor, Hobo, [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] puppet, Santa Claus, and the Narrator\n**[[Daryl Sabara]] as Hero Boy {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**[[Josh Hutcherson]] as Hero Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*Leslie Zemeckis as Sister Sarah {{ref|mocap|I}} and Hero Boy's mother\n**Isabella Peregrina as Sister Sarah {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**Ashly Holloway as Sister Sarah {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*[[Eddie Deezen]] as Know-It-All\n**[[Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak]] as Know-It-All {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*[[Nona Gaye]] as Hero Girl\n**Chantel Valdivieso as Hero Girl {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n**Meagan Moore as Hero Girl {{ref|singing|V}}\n**[[Tinashe]] as Hero Girl {{ref|model-mocap|III}}\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|mocap|I}}\n**Hayden McFarland as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n**[[Jimmy Bennett]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**[[Matthew Hall (actor)|Matthew Hall]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|singing|V}}\n*[[Dylan Cash]] as Boy on Train {{ref|voice|IV}}\n*Brendan King and Andy Pellick as Pastry Chefs\n*Josh Eli, Rolandas Hendricks, [[Jon Scott]], Sean Scott, Mark Mendonca, [[Mark Goodman]], Gregory Gast, and Gordon Hart as Waiters\n*[[Michael Jeter]] as Smokey and Steamer {{ref|mocap|I}}\n**[[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] as Smokey and Steamer {{ref|voice|IV}}\n*[[Chris Coppola]] as Gus the Toothless Boy and an Elf\n**Connor Matheus as Toothless Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*Julene Renee as Red Head Girl and an Elf\n*[[Phil Fondacaro]], [[Debbie Lee Carrington]], [[Mark Povinelli]], and Ed Gale as Elves\n*[[Charles Fleischer]] as Elf General\n*[[Steven Tyler]] as Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer\n{{div col end}}\n*{{note|mocap|}} '''I''' [[Motion-capture]] only, {{note|ad-mocap|}} '''II''' Additional motion-capture, {{note|model-mocap|}} '''III''' Motion-capture modeling, {{note|voice|}} '''IV''' Voice only, {{note|singing|}} '''V''' Singing voice only\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nHanks optioned the book in 1999 with the hopes of playing the conductor and Santa Claus.<ref name=riding>{{cite web |title=Riding the Polar Express |url=https://www.wired.com/2004/11/riding-the-polar-express/ |website=Wired |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref> One of the conditions of the sale was that the resulting film not be animated.

Co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], the film features human characters animated using live-action [[motion capture]] animation. The film tells the story of a young boy who, on [[Christmas Eve]], sees a mysterious train bound for the [[North Pole]] stop outside his window and is invited aboard by its conductor. The boy joins several other children as they embark on a journey to visit Santa Claus preparing for Christmas. The film stars [[Tom Hanks]], who was also one of the film's executive producers, in multiple distinct roles, with [[Daryl Sabara]], [[Nona Gaye]], [[Jimmy Bennett]] and [[Eddie Deezen]] in supporting roles. The film also includes a performance by [[Tinashe]] at age 9, as the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model for the female protagonist.\n\n[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] produced the film in association with [[Shangri-La Entertainment]], [[ImageMovers]], [[Playtone]] and Golden Mean Productions for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], as Castle Rock's first animated film. The visual effects and performance capture were done at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]. The film was made with a production budget of $165 million, a record-breaking sum for an animated feature at the time.\n\n''The Polar Express'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] theaters on November 10, 2004. The film grossed $311.3 million worldwide, and was later listed in the 2006 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the first all-digital capture film. It also marks [[Michael Jeter]]'s last acting role before his death, and the film was thus dedicated to his memory.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Review: 'The Polar Express'|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|access-date=December 10, 2014|work=Variety|date=October 24, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226224253/http://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|archive-date=December 26, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], on the night of Christmas Eve, a boy becomes skeptical of the existence of Santa Claus. Struggling to fall asleep, he witnesses a steam locomotive arrive on the street, and goes outside to examine it. The conductor introduces the train as the Polar Express, bound for the North Pole. Initially reluctant, the boy jumps aboard as the train departs.\n\nIn a passenger car, he meets a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy. The train picks up a boy named Billy, who also declines to board, but changes his mind, and the boy applies the brakes to allow Billy to board, which is noticed by the conductor. As Billy sits alone in the train's [[observation car]], hot chocolate is served in the passenger car, and the girl stows away a cup for Billy. As she and the conductor cross to the dining car, the boy notices that she left her unpunched ticket, but loses hold of the ticket between the cars when he attempts to return it. The ticket reenters the passenger car, but not before the conductor notices its absence and escorts the girl back to the rear car.\n\nWhen the know-it-all claims the conductor will throw the girl from the train, the boy recovers the ticket and dashes to the dining car in search of the conductor, climbing onto the roof. He meets a hobo camping on the roof, who offers him coffee and discusses the existence of Santa Claus and ghosts. The hobo skis with the boy along the tops of the cars toward the [[tender (rail)|coal tender]], where the hobo disappears right at Flat Top Tunnel. \n\nIn the locomotive's cab, the boy discovers that the girl has been made to supervise driving the train while the engineers Steamer and Smokey replace the headlight. \n\nThe boy applies the brakes and the train stops coming across a herd of [[caribou]] blocking the tracks. The conductor pulls Smokey's beard, causing him to let out animal-like noises, and the caribou herd strolls away. \n\nThe train continues on at extreme speed, and the throttle's [[split pin]] (cotter pin) shears off, causing the train to accelerate uncontrollably down a 179-degree grade and onto a frozen lake. Smokey uses his hairpin to repair the throttle as the train drifts across the ice to realign with the tracks moments before the ice breaks.\n\nThe boy returns the girl's ticket for the conductor to punch, and as the three return to the passenger car.\n\nThe train arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one of the passengers will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa himself. \n\nDiscovering Billy still alone in the observation car, the girl and boy persuade him to come along, but the boy accidentally uncouples the car, sending it back along the line to a [[railway turntable]] in Santa's workshop. \n\nThe children make their way through an elf command center and a gift sorting office before being dumped into a giant sack of presents, where they discover that the know-it-all has stowed away, and the elves escort them out as Santa arrives. \n\nA bell flies loose from the galloping reindeer's reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. He shows the bell to Santa, who selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas. Santa agrees to let him keep the bell, and the boy places it in his robe pocket.\n\nThe rear car is returned to the train as the children board to return home, but the boy discovers that he lost the bell through the hole in his pocket. \n\nHe returns home and awakens Christmas morning to find a present containing the bell. He and his younger sister Sarah joyfully ring the bell, while their parents, not believing in Santa, say that the bell is broken. \n\nThe boy reflects on his friends and sister growing deaf to the bell as their belief faded. However, the bell still rings for him, as it will \"for all who truly believe\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michael Jeter at the 44th Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|175px|right|thumb|This film marks the final performance of actor [[Michael Jeter]]; Jeter died the year before the film's release.]]\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Hero Boy {{ref|mocap|I}}, Hero Boy's father, Conductor, Hobo, [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] puppet, Santa Claus, and the Narrator\n**[[Daryl Sabara]] as Hero Boy {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**[[Josh Hutcherson]] as Hero Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*Leslie Zemeckis as Sister Sarah {{ref|mocap|I}} and Hero Boy's mother\n**Isabella Peregrina as Sister Sarah {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**Ashly Holloway as Sister Sarah {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*[[Eddie Deezen]] as Know-It-All\n**[[Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak]] as Know-It-All {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*[[Nona Gaye]] as Hero Girl\n**Chantel Valdivieso as Hero Girl {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n**Meagan Moore as Hero Girl {{ref|singing|V}}\n**[[Tinashe]] as Hero Girl {{ref|model-mocap|III}}\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|mocap|I}}\n**Hayden McFarland as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n**[[Jimmy Bennett]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**[[Matthew Hall (actor)|Matthew Hall]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|singing|V}}\n*[[Dylan Cash]] as Boy on Train {{ref|voice|IV}}\n*Brendan King and Andy Pellick as Pastry Chefs\n*Josh Eli, Rolandas Hendricks, [[Jon Scott]], Sean Scott, Mark Mendonca, [[Mark Goodman]], Gregory Gast, and Gordon Hart as Waiters\n*[[Michael Jeter]] as Smokey and Steamer {{ref|mocap|I}}\n**[[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] as Smokey and Steamer {{ref|voice|IV}}\n*[[Chris Coppola]] as Gus the Toothless Boy and an Elf\n**Connor Matheus as Toothless Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*Julene Renee as Red Head Girl and an Elf\n*[[Phil Fondacaro]], [[Debbie Lee Carrington]], [[Mark Povinelli]], and Ed Gale as Elves\n*[[Charles Fleischer]] as Elf General\n*[[Steven Tyler]] as Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer\n{{div col end}}\n*{{note|mocap|}} '''I''' [[Motion-capture]] only, {{note|ad-mocap|}} '''II''' Additional motion-capture, {{note|model-mocap|}} '''III''' Motion-capture modeling, {{note|voice|}} '''IV''' Voice only, {{note|singing|}} '''V''' Singing voice only\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nHanks optioned the book in 1999 with the hopes of playing the conductor and Santa Claus.<ref name=riding>{{cite web |title=Riding the Polar Express |url=https://www.wired.com/2004/11/riding-the-polar-express/ |website=Wired |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref> One of the conditions of the sale was that the resulting film not be animated.

National Guard came about in part due to the efforts of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], the first president to spend his term in District of Columbia He came into office during a time when strife between two major political parties was threatening to tear the new country apart. Soon, the commanding generals of the two closest militia units were members of President Jefferson's rival political party. At this point, there was only a very small regular army, and they were mostly patrolling the border. If one of the state's militias tried to force political will, there would be no way to keep them from marching on the Capitol and coercing\u2014or even overthrowing\u2014the government.\n\nPresident Jefferson saw how vulnerable America's democracy would be if the will of a military general could keep the legislative body from enacting the will of the people. To prevent this, the Militia of the District of Columbia was created in the Assumption Act of May 3, 1802.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Acts of Congress, in Relation to the District of Columbia |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_2.djvu/231 |publisher=U.S. Government |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only local National Guard with a national mission\u2014to protect our Federal Government \u2013 a mission reflected in its motto \"Capital Guardians.\"\n\nOn October 30, 1802, the D.C. Militia held its first muster. President Jefferson hand-selected his new officers and was known to enjoy attending drills. A year later, the Congress officially recognized the organization.\n\n=== The Bladensburg races ===\n\nThe fledgling D.C. Militia was tested during the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Battle of Bladensburg]]. Maryland and Virginia, preoccupied with attacks on their own territory, were sluggish to send troops to D.C. The D.C. Militia, even when augmented by regular forces, was overwhelmed and ordered to withdraw. They watched their nation's capital burn. After the incident, Congress too noticed and increased the size and equipment of the D.C. Militia.\n\nOther than the Headquarters itself, which traces its lineage to 1776 as an elements of the Maryland Militia in Georgetown and Bladensburg, the oldest continuous unit of the D.C. National Guard is Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 372nd Military Police Battalion which traces its lineage to the Washington Light Infantry organized in 1836 by John A. Blake.<ref>Compendium, 1986, unpublished, ''District of Columbia Militia & National Guard: Organized and Volunteer Units, 1789 through 1917'', B. Michael Berger & Charles A. Shaughnessy.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Scott Key and the national anthem ===\n\nThe war of 1812 would produce an American treasure and one of the most famous veterans of the D.C. National Guard: [[Francis Scott Key]], a lieutenant with the [[Georgetown, District of Columbia|Georgetown]] Field Artillery of the D.C. Militia. During the British bombardment in Baltimore Barbour, he was sent to Maryland to negotiate with the British for a prisoner exchange. After negotiations, the ship's commander felt Key had seen too much and needed to stay on the ship through the rest of the attack on Baltimore's Fort McHenry. In the morning he observed the flag still flying above the Fort and was inspired to write the poem that became the lyrics to [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\u2014 the national anthem of the United States. Since Key was on military orders to guarantee his safe passage, it may be said that the Star Spangled Banner was written by a District of Columbia national guardsman on temporary active duty.\n\n=== Inaugural heritage ===\n\nThe D.C. National Guard has played a special role in [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential Inaugurations]], a tradition starting in the earliest days of the nation. The D.C. Militia or National Guard has been at every presidential Inauguration beginning with an honor detail which rode with [[George Washington|President Washington]] in recognition of his time as Virginia's militia commander.\n\n[[File:2013 Presidential Inauguration.png|thumb|right|A D.C. National Guard soldier helps local civilian authorities with traffic control and crowd management, among other activities, at the 2013 presidential inauguration]]\n\nThe D.C. Guard's participation in inaugurations may be that old, but certainly takes form in 1860. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] triggered several southern states to eventually secede from the Union. At Lincoln's first inaugural, [[Winfield Scott|Lieutenant General Winfield Scott]], General-in-Chief of the Army, ordered the D.C. Militia to protect the president-elect from harm. The D.C. Militia guarded the parade routes, [[sapper]]s preceded the president-elect, and D.C. [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] rode alongside of him, bucking their horses to make it difficult for snipers to take a shot. Upon arriving at the White House the new president received his first military salute from volunteer members of the D.C. Militia and an unbroken tradition of inaugural service was born.\n\nWhen necessary, members of the D.C. National Guard may be deputized as special police, a role the active Army and Air Force cannot perform. That makes the National Guard an important element in large-scale events such as an inauguration. In 2009, the D.C. National Guard led a group of over ten thousand National Guard soldiers and airmen in support of the largest inauguration in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Guard to support inauguration |url=http://www.ang.af.mil/Media/Article-Display/Article/436247/national-guard-to-support-inauguration/ |publisher=U.S. Air Force |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nAs war approached, the D.C. Militia was commanded by [[Major General]] Roger C. Weightman, one of six District of Columbia Mayors to serve as D.C. Militia Colonels or Generals.  His subordinates included Major General Force; [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]]s Bacon and Carrington; and Brigadier General [[Robert Ould]], who would move to Virginia and later join the [[Confederate States Army]].<ref>[[Charles Pomeroy Stone]], \"Washington on the Eve of the War\", in [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[Clarence Clough Buel]] (1887), ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', reprint, Secaucus, NJ:  Castle, pp. 12, {{ISBN|0-89009-569-8}}.</ref>\n\nMaryland and Virginia were both slave states at the beginning of the war, surrounding District of Columbia with potential enemy territory. Three days before the shots at [[Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called in the D.C. Militia to protect the capital, making it famous for providing \"the first man\u2026first company\u2026first regiment\" mobilized for the [[American Civil War]].\n\nThe D.C. Militia saw an unfortunate first when Private Manual C. Causten became the first Union [[prisoner of war]] captured by the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nD.C. Militia soldiers served on active duty for up to four years, engaging in combat during the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]] and the [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. They also maintained their historical role as protectors of the Capital, manning the forts which encircled Washington, D.C. At [[Fort Stevens (Washington, D.C.)|Fort Stevens]], in District of Columbia soldiers included African-American quartermaster clerks who were originally not allowed to join combat regiments.  As D.C. faced attack from the [[Confederate States Army]], they were issued weapons and told to defend their city. President Abraham Lincoln traveled to Fort Stevens to view the fighting. It is said that he was brusquely ordered from harm's way by an officer, possibly Horatio Wright, although other probably apocryphal stories claim that it was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], later Acting Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be the only time in history that a serving president would face enemy fire.\n\n=== Black militia: 1867\u20131898 ===\nThe Butler [[Zouave|Zouaves]], named after [[Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], and the Stanton Guard, named after Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], were the first post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] African-American units to organize. The Butler Zouaves survived the decline of the militia in the late 1870s and, in 1887, entered the then new National Guard of the District of Columbia as its Fifth Battalion. The first unit destined to become a permanent part of the D.C. Guard, however, was the Washington Cadet Corps, established June 12, 1880, as a single company (\"Company A\"), and expanded in October 1884 as a three-company battalion, reaching its full four-company strength in 1885.<ref name=\"Columbia-Historical-Soc 1971-72, Vols. 71-72\" />\n\n=== Protecting the nation's borders ===\nFrom its earliest days, the D.C. National Guard has remained ready to accept the call to protect the [[United States]], participating in the [[Creek War]], [[Seminole Wars]] and Spanish-American In 1898, the D.C's 1st Volunteer Infantry fought alongside the United States Volunteers during the War, where they earned credit for the Santiago Campaign.\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n[[File:Arms room.jpg|thumb|right|Enlisted men of the 1st Separate Battalion, an all African-American unit, examining weapons in the old army arms room prior to [[World War I]]]]\n\nIn 1917, fearing espionage, D.C. National Guard elements were mobilized 12 days before the U.S. officially entered World War I to protect reservoirs and power plants around District of Columbia Military officials were concerned that too many of the D.C. units were made up of men with foreign roots, thus the job of protecting vital facilities fell to the all-black 1st Separate Infantry, the only unit the military believed could be trusted with this mission.\n\nEventually the 1st Separate was mustered into active service and re-designated the 1st Battalion of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry]]. In France, unsure of what to do with an African-American regiment, the 372nd was attached the [[157th Infantry Division (France)|French army's 157th \"Red Hand\" Division]]. The Soldiers fought in [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]], [[Lorraine]] and [[Alsace]], where they were awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]]\u2014one of the highest honors bestowed by the French military. [[Mariano Goybet|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral '''Goybet''']], the 157th commanding general, gave the unit a Red Hand insignia in honor of their service. The red hand appears today on the crest of the 372nd Military Police Battalion. Although many D.C. National Guard units were mobilized, the 372nd was the only one to actually see combat during the war.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II, the D.C. Guard was immediately mobilized. Ground units served in both the Pacific and European theaters and air units saw service along the Atlantic coast in anti-submarine defense. The D.C. National Guard's 121st Engineer Combat Battalion was among the units in the first wave on Omaha beach in [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], and is immortalized in the 1962 movie, ''The Longest Day''.\n\nIn 1940, the 121st Observation Squadron was organized and began operations at [[Bolling Air Force Base|Bolling Field]] (today Bolling Air Force Base) in District of Columbia It ended the war as the 121st Fighter Squadron. At the end of the war the U.S. Army Air Corps (later the U.S. Air Force) decided to preserve the history of its most famous fighter unit, the 352nd Fighter Group (know affectionately as the ''Bluenosed Bastards of Bodney''), and allocated it to the [[113th Wing|D.C Air National Guard's 113th Wing]]. Since the 113th Wing includes the 121st, it carries the campaign credit from the Antisubmarine Campaign, the Po Valley Campaign, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|North Apennines Campaign]] and the Rome-Arno Campaign.\n\n=== The Cold War era ===\n\nAt the end of World War II, the D.C. National Guard faced the enormous task of restructuring and retraining. The [[Cold War]] years marked a new relationship between the National Guard and active military. In 1947, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] was designated a separate branch of the military; the D.C. [[Air National Guard]] became a reality in 1950, when the 113th Wing received federal recognition.\n\nIn 1951, the D.C. Army National Guard's 715th Truck Company became one of the few National Guard units mobilized for the [[Korean War]] to actually go to Korea. They called their orderly room in Korea the [[President's Guest House|Blair House]] after the president's Guest House.\n\nIn 1961, the 113th Wing was activated for a year in support of the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. In 1968, they were again activated by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] in response to the Pueblo Crisis. The bulk of the unit was assigned to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Later, many of these airmen deployed as individuals to Vietnam in support of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War most National Guard units were purposefully left out of the war over concern that a National Guard call-up would increase the unpopularity of the war. As part of the individual or \"levied\" replacement program, Air National Guard pilots were allowed to volunteer for deployment to Vietnam. The 113th Wing established a Replacement Training Unit to send [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100C Super Sabre]] pilots to the conflict. In 1968, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Flanagan, who had been a D.C. air guardsman, was shot down and killed over Vietnam, one of the few National Guard casualties.\n\n=== 9/11 response ===\n\nContinuous combat air patrols were maintained over Washington, D.C., and New York City until the spring of 2002. Today, the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Aerospace Control Alert Detachment, day, night, rain or shine, are on alert 24/7 protecting the skies of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, a duty officer from the 113th Wing, D.C. Air National Guard, received a call from the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] with instructions from the White House to get the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in the air. [[The Pentagon]] had just been hit, and the White House knew another airliner, [[United Airlines Flight 93|United Flight 93]]\u2014had been hijacked. After a call with the White House operations center, the 113th Wing commander issued a scrambled order to set up a combat air patrol over D.C. and to deter all aircraft within 20 miles with \"whatever force is necessary\u2026to keep from hitting a building downtown.\" As the F-16 crew returned due to fuel, the next crew went out. There was no time to arm them with missiles, so each fighter went out carrying only 500 training bullets\u2014just enough for a five-second burst. At the time, they believed that there may be more hostile aircraft. Each committed to doing whatever necessary to stop any hostile aircraft they encountered, up to and including ramming the airliner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Record LtCol Marc H Saseville |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-042-doc16.pdf |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> By this point, fighters from [[Langley Air Force Base]] and the fighters from the D.C. National Guard were put in contact with each other. Flight 93 was no longer a threat, but the two units worked together to escort aircraft out of the airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, with little more information that several people at the Pentagon were dead and several more injured, the D.C. Army National Guard helicopter pilots were launched from Davidson Army Air Field to the site of the attack on the Pentagon. They began ferrying casualties to [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] and medical personnel back to the Pentagon.\n\nIn the days after September 11, 600 soldiers from the D.C. Army National Guard were mobilized around the city, including the Capitol building. The [[Mobilization Augmentation Command]] reported to duty immediately, becoming the first National Guard unit mobilized for the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror.]]\n\n=== Global War on Terror ===\nThe D.C. National Guard has deployed more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen to support the Global War on Terror. The D.C. Guard completed over 90 whole-unit deployments, including tours in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Guantanamo Bay]], Saudi Arabia and stateside missions as part of [[Operation Noble Eagle]]. Many D.C. National Guard soldiers and airmen served multiple deployments. Since September 11, 2001, the 113th Wing has provided 24-hour protective coverage over the skies of the [[United States]]'s Capitals, as the \"D.C. National Guard Capitol Guardians.\"\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n== Unique law ==\nNormally, U.S. [[federal law]] specifically charges the [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. National Guard]] with dual federal and state missions. As [[Maryland]] gave the U.S. federal government jurisdiction in the District of Columbia to establish a [[federal district]], there is no elected governor to command this guard unit. The D.C. National Guard is the only National Guard that reports only to the [[President of the United States|president]].\n\nSupervision and control of D.C. National Guard was delegated by the president to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] pursuant to Executive Order 10030, 26 January 1949 with authority to designate National Military Establishment officials to administer affairs of the D.C. National Guard. The [[United States Secretary of the Army|Army secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the ground component, and the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Air Force secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the air component.\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only U.S. military force empowered to carry out federal functions in a state or, in this case, a district. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of [[martial law]] when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president or [[United States Congress|Congress]].\n\nWhen the D.C. National Guard is called to federal service, the president serves as [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]]. The federal mission assigned to the U.S. National Guard is \"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed.\"\n\n==List of commanding generals==\nThe District of Columbia commanding general is the senior military officer and commander of the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Act of 1871 placed a governor at the head of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Militia, and from 1871 to 1887, there was no commanding general. in 1887, the position of governor was eliminated and a commissioner form of government was established with five appointed commissioners, and the position of commanding general returned.\n\nAs of today, there have been 23 commanding generals of the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Appointment\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Date of Relief\n|-\n|Brig.

It usually is constituted as part of a larger local or Federal effort to prepare for or react to an emerging situation, including [[National Special Security Events]].\n\nIt is tasked to support presidential inaugurations, [[State of the Union]] (SOTA) addresses, summits like the [[Nuclear Security Summit]], protests, [[Snowmageddon|weather-related storms]], the annual Washington, D.C., [[Fourth of July]] event, among others.\n\nJTF-DC participates in all inter-agency planning and conducts planning with joint partners in the [[National Capital Region]] (NCR). Additionally, JTF-DC provides support, including traffic control, crowd management and security, for presidential inaugurations and related official ceremonies and events throughout the inaugural period, continuing the tradition of military participation in the presidential inauguration of the commander-in-chief dating back to the inauguration of George Washington in 1789.\n\n== State Partnership Program ==\n[[File:Walker Jamaica Visit.jpg|thumb|right|Brig.

Jamaica joined the SPP with the District of Columbia National Guard in 1999. Jamaica fall under the area of operations of [[SOUTHCOM]].\n\n== D.C. National Guard Museum ==\nThe D.C. National Guard Museum, also known as Brigadier General Wes Hamilton Museum, is a [[Museum#military museum|military museum]] of the District of Columbia National Guard. It is located at the District of Columbia National Guard headquarters at the [[D.C. Armory]], adjacent to the Stadium-Armory Metro Stop near [[Robert F.

Guardsmen ==\n* [[John Mason (planter)]],  son of [[George Mason]], a [[Founding Father of the United States]], Mason was the first commanding general of the D.C. Militia, appointed personally by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1802.\n* [[John Peter Van Ness]], was an American politician who was a [[United States Representative|United States representative]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] and who served as the tenth [[mayor of the District of Columbia]] and the second commanding general of the District of Columbia Militia.\n* [[Francis Scott Key]] was a lieutenant with the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] Field Artillery of the D.C. Militia. During the British bombardment in Baltimore Barbour, he wrote the poem that is now the lyrics to [[the Star-Spangled Banner]].\n* [[Roger C. Weightman]] was an American politician, civic leader, and printer. He was the eighth [[mayor of the District of Columbia]] from 1824 to 1827 and served as commanding general of the District of Columbia Militia from 1847 to 1849.\n* [[Albert Lyman Cox]] was a [[College Football All-Southern Team]] [[End (American football)|end]] for the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] of the [[University of North Carolina]]. He was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] and in 1916, Cox was appointed North Carolina state superior judge.\n* [[William H.

National Guard ===\n[[File:CGs.jpg|thumb|left|(From left to right): District of Columbia Militia commanding generals, Brig. Gen. Richard Simms (January 18, 1918 \u2013 March 31, 1920), Maj. Gen. Anton Stephan (April 28, 1920 \u2013 April 10, 1934) and Brig. Gen. William Harvey (June 4, 1913 \u2013 August 17, 1917)]]\n\nThe D.C. National Guard came about in part due to the efforts of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], the first president to spend his term in District of Columbia He came into office during a time when strife between two major political parties was threatening to tear the new country apart. Soon, the commanding generals of the two closest militia units were members of President Jefferson's rival political party. At this point, there was only a very small regular army, and they were mostly patrolling the border. If one of the state's militias tried to force political will, there would be no way to keep them from marching on the Capitol and coercing\u2014or even overthrowing\u2014the government.\n\nPresident Jefferson saw how vulnerable America's democracy would be if the will of a military general could keep the legislative body from enacting the will of the people. To prevent this, the Militia of the District of Columbia was created in the Assumption Act of May 3, 1802.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Acts of Congress, in Relation to the District of Columbia |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_2.djvu/231 |publisher=U.S. Government |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only local National Guard with a national mission\u2014to protect our Federal Government \u2013 a mission reflected in its motto \"Capital Guardians.\"\n\nOn October 30, 1802, the D.C. Militia held its first muster. President Jefferson hand-selected his new officers and was known to enjoy attending drills. A year later, the Congress officially recognized the organization.\n\n=== The Bladensburg races ===\n\nThe fledgling D.C. Militia was tested during the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Battle of Bladensburg]]. Maryland and Virginia, preoccupied with attacks on their own territory, were sluggish to send troops to D.C. The D.C. Militia, even when augmented by regular forces, was overwhelmed and ordered to withdraw. They watched their nation's capital burn. After the incident, Congress too noticed and increased the size and equipment of the D.C. Militia.\n\nOther than the Headquarters itself, which traces its lineage to 1776 as an elements of the Maryland Militia in Georgetown and Bladensburg, the oldest continuous unit of the D.C. National Guard is Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 372nd Military Police Battalion which traces its lineage to the Washington Light Infantry organized in 1836 by John A. Blake.<ref>Compendium, 1986, unpublished, ''District of Columbia Militia & National Guard: Organized and Volunteer Units, 1789 through 1917'', B. Michael Berger & Charles A. Shaughnessy.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Scott Key and the national anthem ===\n\nThe war of 1812 would produce an American treasure and one of the most famous veterans of the D.C. National Guard: [[Francis Scott Key]], a lieutenant with the [[Georgetown, District of Columbia|Georgetown]] Field Artillery of the D.C. Militia. During the British bombardment in Baltimore Barbour, he was sent to Maryland to negotiate with the British for a prisoner exchange. After negotiations, the ship's commander felt Key had seen too much and needed to stay on the ship through the rest of the attack on Baltimore's Fort McHenry. In the morning he observed the flag still flying above the Fort and was inspired to write the poem that became the lyrics to [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\u2014 the national anthem of the United States. Since Key was on military orders to guarantee his safe passage, it may be said that the Star Spangled Banner was written by a District of Columbia national guardsman on temporary active duty.\n\n=== Inaugural heritage ===\n\nThe D.C. National Guard has played a special role in [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential Inaugurations]], a tradition starting in the earliest days of the nation. The D.C. Militia or National Guard has been at every presidential Inauguration beginning with an honor detail which rode with [[George Washington|President Washington]] in recognition of his time as Virginia's militia commander.\n\n[[File:2013 Presidential Inauguration.png|thumb|right|A D.C. National Guard soldier helps local civilian authorities with traffic control and crowd management, among other activities, at the 2013 presidential inauguration]]\n\nThe D.C. Guard's participation in inaugurations may be that old, but certainly takes form in 1860. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] triggered several southern states to eventually secede from the Union. At Lincoln's first inaugural, [[Winfield Scott|Lieutenant General Winfield Scott]], General-in-Chief of the Army, ordered the D.C. Militia to protect the president-elect from harm. The D.C. Militia guarded the parade routes, [[sapper]]s preceded the president-elect, and D.C. [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] rode alongside of him, bucking their horses to make it difficult for snipers to take a shot. Upon arriving at the White House the new president received his first military salute from volunteer members of the D.C. Militia and an unbroken tradition of inaugural service was born.\n\nWhen necessary, members of the D.C. National Guard may be deputized as special police, a role the active Army and Air Force cannot perform. That makes the National Guard an important element in large-scale events such as an inauguration. In 2009, the D.C. National Guard led a group of over ten thousand National Guard soldiers and airmen in support of the largest inauguration in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Guard to support inauguration |url=http://www.ang.af.mil/Media/Article-Display/Article/436247/national-guard-to-support-inauguration/ |publisher=U.S. Air Force |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nAs war approached, the D.C. Militia was commanded by [[Major General]] Roger C. Weightman, one of six District of Columbia Mayors to serve as D.C. Militia Colonels or Generals.  His subordinates included Major General Force; [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]]s Bacon and Carrington; and Brigadier General [[Robert Ould]], who would move to Virginia and later join the [[Confederate States Army]].<ref>[[Charles Pomeroy Stone]], \"Washington on the Eve of the War\", in [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[Clarence Clough Buel]] (1887), ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', reprint, Secaucus, NJ:  Castle, pp. 12, {{ISBN|0-89009-569-8}}.</ref>\n\nMaryland and Virginia were both slave states at the beginning of the war, surrounding District of Columbia with potential enemy territory. Three days before the shots at [[Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called in the D.C. Militia to protect the capital, making it famous for providing \"the first man\u2026first company\u2026first regiment\" mobilized for the [[American Civil War]].\n\nThe D.C. Militia saw an unfortunate first when Private Manual C. Causten became the first Union [[prisoner of war]] captured by the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nD.C. Militia soldiers served on active duty for up to four years, engaging in combat during the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]] and the [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. They also maintained their historical role as protectors of the Capital, manning the forts which encircled Washington, D.C. At [[Fort Stevens (Washington, D.C.)|Fort Stevens]], in District of Columbia soldiers included African-American quartermaster clerks who were originally not allowed to join combat regiments.  As D.C. faced attack from the [[Confederate States Army]], they were issued weapons and told to defend their city. President Abraham Lincoln traveled to Fort Stevens to view the fighting. It is said that he was brusquely ordered from harm's way by an officer, possibly Horatio Wright, although other probably apocryphal stories claim that it was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], later Acting Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be the only time in history that a serving president would face enemy fire.\n\n=== Black militia: 1867\u20131898 ===\nThe Butler [[Zouave|Zouaves]], named after [[Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], and the Stanton Guard, named after Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], were the first post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] African-American units to organize. The Butler Zouaves survived the decline of the militia in the late 1870s and, in 1887, entered the then new National Guard of the District of Columbia as its Fifth Battalion. The first unit destined to become a permanent part of the D.C. Guard, however, was the Washington Cadet Corps, established June 12, 1880, as a single company (\"Company A\"), and expanded in October 1884 as a three-company battalion, reaching its full four-company strength in 1885.<ref name=\"Columbia-Historical-Soc 1971-72, Vols. 71-72\" />\n\n=== Protecting the nation's borders ===\nFrom its earliest days, the D.C. National Guard has remained ready to accept the call to protect the [[United States]], participating in the [[Creek War]], [[Seminole Wars]] and Spanish-American In 1898, the D.C's 1st Volunteer Infantry fought alongside the United States Volunteers during the War, where they earned credit for the Santiago Campaign.\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n[[File:Arms room.jpg|thumb|right|Enlisted men of the 1st Separate Battalion, an all African-American unit, examining weapons in the old army arms room prior to [[World War I]]]]\n\nIn 1917, fearing espionage, D.C. National Guard elements were mobilized 12 days before the U.S. officially entered World War I to protect reservoirs and power plants around District of Columbia Military officials were concerned that too many of the D.C. units were made up of men with foreign roots, thus the job of protecting vital facilities fell to the all-black 1st Separate Infantry, the only unit the military believed could be trusted with this mission.\n\nEventually the 1st Separate was mustered into active service and re-designated the 1st Battalion of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry]]. In France, unsure of what to do with an African-American regiment, the 372nd was attached the [[157th Infantry Division (France)|French army's 157th \"Red Hand\" Division]]. The Soldiers fought in [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]], [[Lorraine]] and [[Alsace]], where they were awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]]\u2014one of the highest honors bestowed by the French military. [[Mariano Goybet|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral '''Goybet''']], the 157th commanding general, gave the unit a Red Hand insignia in honor of their service. The red hand appears today on the crest of the 372nd Military Police Battalion. Although many D.C. National Guard units were mobilized, the 372nd was the only one to actually see combat during the war.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II, the D.C. Guard was immediately mobilized. Ground units served in both the Pacific and European theaters and air units saw service along the Atlantic coast in anti-submarine defense. The D.C. National Guard's 121st Engineer Combat Battalion was among the units in the first wave on Omaha beach in [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], and is immortalized in the 1962 movie, ''The Longest Day''.\n\nIn 1940, the 121st Observation Squadron was organized and began operations at [[Bolling Air Force Base|Bolling Field]] (today Bolling Air Force Base) in District of Columbia It ended the war as the 121st Fighter Squadron. At the end of the war the U.S. Army Air Corps (later the U.S. Air Force) decided to preserve the history of its most famous fighter unit, the 352nd Fighter Group (know affectionately as the ''Bluenosed Bastards of Bodney''), and allocated it to the [[113th Wing|D.C Air National Guard's 113th Wing]]. Since the 113th Wing includes the 121st, it carries the campaign credit from the Antisubmarine Campaign, the Po Valley Campaign, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|North Apennines Campaign]] and the Rome-Arno Campaign.\n\n=== The Cold War era ===\n\nAt the end of World War II, the D.C. National Guard faced the enormous task of restructuring and retraining. The [[Cold War]] years marked a new relationship between the National Guard and active military. In 1947, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] was designated a separate branch of the military; the D.C. [[Air National Guard]] became a reality in 1950, when the 113th Wing received federal recognition.\n\nIn 1951, the D.C. Army National Guard's 715th Truck Company became one of the few National Guard units mobilized for the [[Korean War]] to actually go to Korea. They called their orderly room in Korea the [[President's Guest House|Blair House]] after the president's Guest House.\n\nIn 1961, the 113th Wing was activated for a year in support of the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. In 1968, they were again activated by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] in response to the Pueblo Crisis. The bulk of the unit was assigned to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Later, many of these airmen deployed as individuals to Vietnam in support of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War most National Guard units were purposefully left out of the war over concern that a National Guard call-up would increase the unpopularity of the war. As part of the individual or \"levied\" replacement program, Air National Guard pilots were allowed to volunteer for deployment to Vietnam. The 113th Wing established a Replacement Training Unit to send [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100C Super Sabre]] pilots to the conflict. In 1968, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Flanagan, who had been a D.C. air guardsman, was shot down and killed over Vietnam, one of the few National Guard casualties.\n\n=== 9/11 response ===\n\nContinuous combat air patrols were maintained over Washington, D.C., and New York City until the spring of 2002. Today, the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Aerospace Control Alert Detachment, day, night, rain or shine, are on alert 24/7 protecting the skies of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, a duty officer from the 113th Wing, D.C. Air National Guard, received a call from the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] with instructions from the White House to get the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in the air. [[The Pentagon]] had just been hit, and the White House knew another airliner, [[United Airlines Flight 93|United Flight 93]]\u2014had been hijacked. After a call with the White House operations center, the 113th Wing commander issued a scrambled order to set up a combat air patrol over D.C. and to deter all aircraft within 20 miles with \"whatever force is necessary\u2026to keep from hitting a building downtown.\" As the F-16 crew returned due to fuel, the next crew went out. There was no time to arm them with missiles, so each fighter went out carrying only 500 training bullets\u2014just enough for a five-second burst. At the time, they believed that there may be more hostile aircraft. Each committed to doing whatever necessary to stop any hostile aircraft they encountered, up to and including ramming the airliner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Record LtCol Marc H Saseville |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-042-doc16.pdf |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> By this point, fighters from [[Langley Air Force Base]] and the fighters from the D.C. National Guard were put in contact with each other. Flight 93 was no longer a threat, but the two units worked together to escort aircraft out of the airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, with little more information that several people at the Pentagon were dead and several more injured, the D.C. Army National Guard helicopter pilots were launched from Davidson Army Air Field to the site of the attack on the Pentagon. They began ferrying casualties to [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]] and medical personnel back to the Pentagon.\n\nIn the days after September 11, 600 soldiers from the D.C. Army National Guard were mobilized around the city, including the Capitol building. The Mobilization Augmentation Command reported to duty immediately, becoming the first National Guard unit mobilized for the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror.]]\n\n=== Global War on Terror ===\nThe D.C. National Guard has deployed more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen to support the Global War on Terror. The D.C. Guard completed over 90 whole-unit deployments, including tours in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Guantanamo Bay]], Saudi Arabia and stateside missions as part of [[Operation Noble Eagle]]. Many D.C. National Guard soldiers and airmen served multiple deployments. Since September 11, 2001, the 113th Wing has provided 24-hour protective coverage over the skies of the [[United States]]'s Capitals, as the \"D.C. National Guard Capitol Guardians.\"\n\nThe D.C National Guard served with border patrols on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Southwest border]] in 1916 during the [[Pancho Villa]] raids, a mission similar to the one they would return to in the 21st century in support of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\n== Unique law ==\nNormally, U.S. [[federal law]] specifically charges the [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. National Guard]] with dual federal and state missions. As [[Maryland]] gave the U.S. federal government jurisdiction in the District of Columbia to establish a [[federal district]], there is no elected governor to command this guard unit. The D.C. National Guard is the only National Guard that reports only to the [[President of the United States|president]].\n\nSupervision and control of D.C. National Guard was delegated by the president to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] pursuant to Executive Order 10030, 26 January 1949 with authority to designate National Military Establishment officials to administer affairs of the D.C. National Guard. The [[United States Secretary of the Army|Army secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the ground component, and the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Air Force secretary]] was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the air component.\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the only U.S. military force empowered to carry out federal functions in a state or, in this case, a district. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of [[martial law]] when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president or [[United States Congress|Congress]].\n\nWhen the D.C.

[[Charles E. Toberman]], a real estate mogul and the nephew of three-term Los Angeles Mayor, John Toberman, predicted that Hollywood Boulevard would be a mecca for entertainment.  He sold vacant land with the promise that \u201cHollywood is at a threshold of a new era of development.\u201d<ref name=\"Story of Hollywood\"></ref>\nThis period of growth included the grand opening of the The Hollywood Theater in 1913 (which stands as the oldest existing theater in the district today), as well as the area\u2019s first four-story building located at Highland and Hollywood, that included street level stores, offices, and apartment units at the top.

The new legal city height limit was 12 stories.  During this decade, the [[Taft Building (Los Angeles)]] would take the place of the old Hollywood memorial Church at [[Hollywood and Vine]].  The original [[Hollywood Athletic Club]] was located on the corner of Hollywood and Cahuenga Boulevard. The [[Hollywood Masonic Temple]] building, now the home of the [[El Capitan Entertainment Centre]], was established in 1922.  For a time this site was most famous for holding the memorial service of film director [[D.W.

It was located in Wilcox Hall and became a staple for Hollywood\u2019s industry workers.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] often frequented the cafe for hot apple pie.

Warner Hollywood Theater, now [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]] opened in 1927, housed in a four-story old Italian Renaissance building, and located at 6433 Hollywood Boulevard. This theater exhibited [[Warner Brothers]] films including [[Casablanca (film)]].   [[Sid Grauman]], whose family was established in the theater business in [[San Francisco]], teamed with C. E. Tolberman to erect the first movie palace along the boulevard.  In 1922,[[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] opened.  The [[El Capitan Theatre]] and [[Chinese Theatre]] followed in 1926 and 1927.  Subsequently, Tolberman would complete the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] in May of 1927, which remains the oldest running hotel in [[Los Angeles]]. The largest and final movie palace, the [[Pantages Theater (Hollywood)]], would open on June 4, 1930.<ref name=\"Story of Hollywood\"></ref>\n\nOtherwise, Hollywood\u2019s investors were hit hard by the stock market crash of 1920.  Many established retail operations folded as a result of the depression.  Plans for many future developments were scrapped altogether.  However, the film industry was still going strong, attracting tourists and budding actors.  Much like modern day, the Hollywood Boulevard of the early 1930s welcomed psychic healers and other various osteopathic practitioners, while attracting a multitude of eccentrics and vagrants.  However, during this period, architect [[S. Charles Lee]], restyled much of the street, giving the facades a much needed makeover to repair the seediness from the past years.

By 1900, Prospect was still a small country dirt road surrounded by lemon orchards and vegetable fields. Although mostly homes, several establishments sprouted up along the street. The Sackett Hotel, a three-story bed and breakfast spot as well as home to the city\u2019s first post office.

The original [[Hollywood Hotel]] opened in 1902, and would take up much of the acreage surrounding Prospect and Highland. The hotel was a stomping ground for all famous silent movie stars. Today, the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, including the [[Dolby Theater]], which hosts the [[Academy Awards]], stands in place of the former hotel.<ref name=\"Story of Hollywood\"></ref>\n\nThe Los Angeles Gas Company installed the city\u2019s first gas meters in 1904, which allowed for the appearance of street numbers.  After Hollywood\u2019s annexation from Los Angeles in 1910, the 100 block of Hollywood Boulevard became the 6400 block.

[[Charles E. Toberman]], a real estate mogul and the nephew of three-term Los Angeles Mayor, John Toberman, predicted that Hollywood Boulevard would be a mecca for entertainment.  He sold vacant land with the promise that \u201cHollywood is at a threshold of a new era of development.\u201d<ref name=\"Story of Hollywood\"></ref>\nThis period of growth included the grand opening of the The Hollywood Theater in 1913 (which stands as the oldest existing theater in the district today), as well as the area\u2019s first four-story building located at Highland and Hollywood, that included street level stores, offices, and apartment units at the top.  Wilcox and Hollywood Boulevard welcomed Wright's ice cream store, the precursor to the obsolete Wil Wright\u2019s chain of ice cream parlors, which were sprinkled throughout southern California up until the 1970s.<ref name=\"Ice Cream\">{{cite web |last1=Evanier |first1=Mark |title=Wil Wrights |url=https://oldlarestaurants.com/wil-wrights/ |website=Old La Restaurants |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\nThe block between Cahuenga and Wilcox would be the first completely commercial block along Hollywood Boulevard.<ref name=\"Story of Hollywood\"></ref>\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of taller buildings sprouting up along the boulevard.  The new legal city height limit was 12 stories.  During this decade, the [[Taft Building (Los Angeles)]] would take the place of the old Hollywood memorial Church at [[Hollywood and Vine]].  The original [[Hollywood Athletic Club]] was located on the corner of Hollywood and Cahuenga Boulevard. The [[Hollywood Masonic Temple]] building, now the home of the [[El Capitan Entertainment Centre]], was established in 1922.
