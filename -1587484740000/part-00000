Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.<ref name=\"WritingBigWeek\" /> As promotion for ''The Avengers'', Marvel released an official [[infographic]] detailing this timeline in May 2012.<ref name=\"TimelineInfographic\" />\n\nWanting to simplify the in-universe timeline,<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to ''The Avengers'': ''Iron Man 3'' takes place about six months later, during Christmas;<ref name=\"IM3TimeFrame\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Thor: The Dark World'' is set one year later;<ref name=\"ThorTDWSynopsis1\" /> and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' is two years after.<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'' ended the phase in 2015,<ref name=\"THRAvengers2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AntManReleaseDate\" /> with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\"/> For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so ''Captain America: Civil War'' begins a year after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" /> with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set two years after that.<ref name=\"CWIWTimeline\" /> However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> with ''Black Panther'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' respectively beginning a week and several months after ''Civil War'';<ref name=\"BPProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"SMHTimeline\" /> ''Thor: Ragnarok'' beginning four years after ''The Dark World'' and two years after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokSDCC\" /> around the same time as ''Civil War'' and ''Homecoming'';<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' also set two years after ''Civil War'' and shortly before ''Infinity War'';<ref name=\"AMWTimeline\" /> and both ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel ''Vol. 2'' being explicitly set in 2014,<ref name=\"GotGTimeline\" /><ref name=\"GotG2Timeline2\" /> which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between ''Vol. 2'' and ''Infinity War'', though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.<ref name=\"GuardiansIWFourYears\" />\n\nWhen ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017.

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"

Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.<ref name=\"WritingBigWeek\" /> As promotion for ''The Avengers'', Marvel released an official [[infographic]] detailing this timeline in May 2012.<ref name=\"TimelineInfographic\" />\n\nWanting to simplify the in-universe timeline,<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to ''The Avengers'': ''Iron Man 3'' takes place about six months later, during Christmas;<ref name=\"IM3TimeFrame\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Thor: The Dark World'' is set one year later;<ref name=\"ThorTDWSynopsis1\" /> and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' is two years after.<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'' ended the phase in 2015,<ref name=\"THRAvengers2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AntManReleaseDate\" /> with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\"/> For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so ''Captain America: Civil War'' begins a year after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" /> with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set two years after that.<ref name=\"CWIWTimeline\" /> However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> with ''Black Panther'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' respectively beginning a week and several months after ''Civil War'';<ref name=\"BPProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"SMHTimeline\" /> ''Thor: Ragnarok'' beginning four years after ''The Dark World'' and two years after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokSDCC\" /> around the same time as ''Civil War'' and ''Homecoming'';<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' also set two years after ''Civil War'' and shortly before ''Infinity War'';<ref name=\"AMWTimeline\" /> and both ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel ''Vol. 2'' being explicitly set in 2014,<ref name=\"GotGTimeline\" /><ref name=\"GotG2Timeline2\" /> which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between ''Vol. 2'' and ''Infinity War'', though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.<ref name=\"GuardiansIWFourYears\" />\n\nWhen ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of [[Screen Rant]] described the timeline as \"the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set\", bringing \"some sense of balance to the MCU continuity\".<ref name=\"10YearTimelineScreenRant\" /> Following ''Infinity War'', the Russo brothers said future films would not necessarily be set according to real time as there are \"a lot of very inventive ways of where the story can go from here\", with both ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' and ''Captain Marvel'' set earlier in the timeline;<ref name=\"AfterIW\" /> the latter is set in 1995.<ref name=\"CMTimeline\" /> ''Avengers: Endgame'' begins shortly after ''Infinity War'' and ends in 2023 after a five-year time jump.

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"
