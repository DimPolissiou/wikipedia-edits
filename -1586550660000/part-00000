Crumpler first practiced medicine, primarily for poor women and children, in [[Boston]]. After the [[American Civil War]] ended in 1865, she moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]], believing treating women and children there was an ideal way to perform missionary work. Crumpler worked for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] to provide medical care to freed [[slavery|slaves]]. She was subject to \"[[racism|intense racism]]\" and [[sexism]] while practicing medicine.\n\nShe later moved back to Boston to continue to treat women and children. In 1883, she published ''A Book of Medical Discourses''. Dedicated to nurses and mothers, it focused on maternal and pediatric medical care and was one of the first publications written by an African American about medicine.  Crumpler was in fact the only female physician author in the 19th century. A pre-health club named The Rebecca Lee Pre-Health Society at [[Syracuse University]] and the Rebecca Lee Society, one of the first medical societies for African-American women, were named after her.

Crumpler first practiced medicine, primarily for poor women and children, in [[Boston]]. After the [[American Civil War]] ended in 1865, she moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]], believing treating women and children there was an ideal way to perform missionary work. Crumpler worked for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] to provide medical care to freed [[slavery|slaves]]. She was subject to \"[[racism|intense racism]]\" and [[sexism]] while practicing medicine.\n\nShe later moved back to Boston to continue to treat women and children. In 1883, she published ''A Book of Medical Discourses''. Dedicated to nurses and mothers, it focused on maternal and pediatric medical care and was one of the first publications written by an African American about medicine.  Crumpler was in fact the only female physician author in the 19th century. A pre-health club named The Rebecca Lee Pre-Health Society at [[Syracuse University]] and the Rebecca Lee Society, one of the first medical societies for African-American women, were named after her.
