The action was one of a series of operations conducted by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] to contest dominance over the Adriatic between 1807 and 1814. During this period the Adriatic was surrounded by French territory or French client states and as a result British interference was highly disruptive to the movement of French troops and supplies.\n\nThe action came over eight months after the British had achieved a decisive victory over the French at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 was the result of the British interception of a French military convoy traveling from [[Corfu]] to [[Trieste]] with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in [[Napoleon]]'s decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans [[French invasion of Russia|to Russia]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nSince the [[War of the Third Coalition]], the French had maintained client kingdoms in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] that controlled the western shores of the Adriatic. Over the next four years, strategically important islands and territories had been seized in the treaties of [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] and [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], giving Napoleon direct command of the eastern shore.<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> With these treaties, France had seized not only several important fortress islands, most notably [[Corfu]], but also many important shipyards and harbours. Maintaining control of the Adriatic was however even harder than seizing it had been, the threat of attack by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], Russian or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies and the mountainous terrain of the [[Balkans]] forcing the development of garrisons that could be effectively resupplied only by sea.<ref name=\"JH111\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy, preeminent in the [[Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, sought to disrupt French convoys across the Adriatic. Following the Russian withdrawal in 1807, the Royal Navy dispatched a small frigate squadron to operate in the sea. The squadron was commanded by Captain [[William Hoste]], who seized the Illyrian island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] (present-day Vis) to use as a base, waging a campaign against the French and their allies that forced the French Navy to deploy significantly larger forces to combat him.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref> This escalating series of raid and counter raid continued until March 1811, when the French commander in the Adriatic, [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] attacked Lissa with force twice that available to Hoste. In the ensuing battle Hoste not only routed his opponents, but captured two ships, sank another and killed Dubourdieu.<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J.

Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Lissa, the badly wounded Hoste returned to Britain in {{HMS|Amphion|1798|6}} leaving Captain [[James Brisbane]] in command in the Adriatic. Conflict in the theatre was widely dispersed, and so Brisbane delegated command to various commanders of small squadrons and independent cruisers.<ref name=\"ODNBMax\"/> These dispersed forces continued to have success against French convoys; on 27 November 1811, the independently sailing {{HMS|Eagle|1804|6}} foiled an attempt to send supplies to Corfu and captured the unarmed frigate {{ship|French frigate|Corceyre||2}}. The following day at 07:00, a message was received at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] on Lissa warning that another French convoy had been sighted close to the island.<ref name=\"WJ375\">James, p. 375</ref>\n\n==Chase==\nThe British commander on Lissa in November 1811 was Captain [[Murray Maxwell]] of {{HMS|Alceste|1806|6}} with two other frigates and a [[sloop-of-war|sloop]].<ref name=\"ODNBMax\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18408 Maxwell, Sir Murray], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>  Maxwell responded to the signal by readying his squadron to seek out and destroy the convoy, but the attempted invasion of Lissa the previous March had bred caution in the British defenders and Maxwell was therefore compelled to disembark 30 sailors and most of his marines at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] and leave behind the 20-gun {{HMS|Acorn}} to protect the harbour.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardinier, p. 178</ref> This not only weakened the squadron but also delayed it, Maxwell's force not departing Port St. George until 19:00. It was assumed among the British squadron that the convoy comprised {{ship|French frigate|Dana\u00e9|1807|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Flore|1806|2}} and {{ship|Venetian ship|Corona||2}}, the survivors of the Battle of Lissa now sailing from [[Trieste]] to Corfu to supply the island.<ref name=\"WJ376\">James, p. 376</ref>\n\nShortly after passing the southern headland of Lissa, the British squadron encountered a neutral merchant ship that had been carrying Lieutenant John McDougal, formerly of {{HMS|Unite|1803|6}}, to [[Malta]]. McDougal had seen the French ships in passing and identified them as a convoy heading north from Corfu rather than south to it, and had ordered the merchant ship to return him to Lissa to bring warning.<ref name=\"WJ376\"/> The French convoy was under the command of Commodore Fran\u00e7ois-Gilles Montfort and consisted of three ships, the two large frigates {{ship|French frigate|Pomone|1805|2}} and {{ship|French frigate|Pauline|1807|2}} and the smaller {{ship|French ship|Persanne|1809|2}}.

By 11:00 it was evident that ''Persanne'' could not maintain the pace of the two larger frigates and so turned north-east in hopes of escaping independently. ''Active'' initially gave chase to the smaller ship, but Maxwell recalled her and sent ''Unite'' after ''Persanne'', keeping ''Active'' and ''Alceste'' in pursuit of the larger French ships.<ref name=\"WJ376\"/> At 11:50 it became clear that ''Alceste'' would soon catch the heavily laden French ships, and Maxwell sent the telegraph signal to Gordon; \"Remember the battle of Lissa\", the action of eight months before at which Hoste had raised the signal \"Remember Nelson\".<ref name=\"WJ377\"/>\n\nThe first shots were fired at 12:30 by ''Persanne'' close to the island of [[Palagru\u017ea|Pelagosa]] (Palagru\u017ea), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when ''Alceste'' and ''Pomone'' exchanged shots from their stern and bow guns.<ref name=\"WJ377\"/> By 13:40, ''Alceste'' was firing her broadside into ''Pomone'' and simultaneously pressing on all sail in an effort to reach ''Pauline'', but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from ''Pomone'' brought down ''Alceste''{{'}}s main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing ''Pauline'' to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, ''Active'' had arrived in action and was also firing into ''Pomone'', forcing Montfort to bring ''Pauline'' round to protect her outgunned colleague.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> By 14:20 the conflicts between ''Active'' and ''Pomone'' and ''Alceste'' and ''Pauline'' had separated into different duels, ''Pomone'' particularly suffering severely but ''Active'' also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder [[carronade]] shot severing Captain Gordon's leg at the height of the engagement.<ref name=\"ODNBGord\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 Gordon, Sir James Alexander] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164840/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 |date=5 March 2016 }}, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>\n\nAt 15:05 another British ship appeared on the horizon, the sloop {{HMS|Kingfisher|1804|6}}, which persuaded Montfort that he could no longer protect the battered ''Pomone'' against superior numbers.<ref name=\"WJ377\">James, p. 377</ref> ''Pauline'' set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' now concentrated their full broadsides on ''Pomone'', which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. ''Pauline'' escaped, later reaching [[Ancona]] safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.<ref name=\"WJ378\"/>\n\n===''Unite'' vs. ''Persanne''===\nThe secondary engagement of the battle was contested initially within sight of the other combatants, ''Persanne'' firing the first shots at the pursuing ''Unite'' at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that ''Unite'' caught the smaller ship.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard ''Unite'' but none on ''Persanne''. From external appearances, ''Persanne'' seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the [[fifth rate]] ''Unite'', but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, when it became clear that his ship could not outrun ''Unite'', Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.<ref name=\"WJ379\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties suffered in the action were relatively heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men killed or wounded while the French lost over 50 on ''Pomone'' alone. There were no casualties on ''Persanne'', and ''Pauline''{{'}}s losses are unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition.<ref name=\"WJ378\">James, p. 378</ref> The French also lost the cargo aboard ''Persanne'' and ''Pomone'', which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels for gun carriages and numerous other military stores.<ref name=\"WJ379\">James, p. 379</ref>\n\nPromotions were granted to the junior officers of ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' and both crews received praise and prize money for their service in the operation. Similar rewards were not made to the crew of ''Unite'', probably because ''Persanne'' was so much smaller and less-well armed than her opponent.<ref name=\"WJ380\"/> The total prize money was \u00a33,500,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16701|page=280|date=9 February 1913}}</ref> not as much as first anticipated because neither of the captured ships were of sufficient quality to warrant purchase into the Royal Navy. ''Pomone'' had been hastily built in 1803 as the personal warship of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] and as a result was of weak construction while ''Persanne'' had been designed as an armed storeship rather than a full-scale warship. Ultimately ''Pomone'' was transferred to Britain, briefly renamed {{HMS|Ambuscade}} and broken up for materials while ''Persanne'' was sold to the [[Bey of Tunis]].<ref name=\"WJ380\">James, p. 380</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the action had more significant consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon was a serious blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself took an interest in the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his [[French invasion of Russia|attention on Russia]].<ref name=\"JH153\">Henderson, p. 153</ref> In the French Navy, the flight of ''Pauline'' was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command.<ref name=\"Roche\">Roche, vol.1 p.344</ref> In 1817, when [[Murray Maxwell]] visited [[St Helena]] on his return from the East Indies where HMS ''Alceste'' had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words \"Your government must not blame you for the loss of ''Alceste'', for you have taken one of my frigates\".<ref name=\"JH161\">Henderson, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe effects on the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only confirming the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating on the construction of several new ships in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action of the year in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG179\">Gardinier, p. 179</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|Adriatic Campaign]] \n*[[Murray Maxwell]] \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Gardiner\n | first = Robert\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2001 |origyear=1998\n | chapter =\n | title = The Victory of Seapower\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84067-359-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Henderson\n | first = James\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1994\n | origyear = 1970\n | chapter = \n | title = The Frigates\n | publisher = Leo Cooper\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-85052-432-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808\u20131811\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-909-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Roche\n | first = Jean-Michel\n | authorlink =\n | year =\n | chapter =\n | title = Dictionnaire des b\u00e2timents de la flotte de guerre fran\u00e7aise de Colbert \u00e0 nos jours\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | id = ISBN\n}}\n* {{London Gazette|issue=16586|pages=565\u2013567|date=24 March 1812}} Captain Murray Maxwell's despatch concerning the action in the [[London Gazette]].\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1811]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of the Adriatic Sea]]\n[[Category:November 1811 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Action of 29 November 1811\n|partof=the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n|image=La Pomone contre les fregates Alceste et Active.jpg\n|image_size = 300px\n|alt=A naval painting in which a badly damaged ship in the foreground is flanked by two lightly damaged ships that are firing on the central vessel.\n|caption=''La Pomone contre les fr\u00e9gates HMS Alceste et Active''<br />[[Pierre Julien Gilbert]], 1836.

Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>  Maxwell responded to the signal by readying his squadron to seek out and destroy the convoy, but the attempted invasion of Lissa the previous March had bred caution in the British defenders and Maxwell was therefore compelled to disembark 30 sailors and most of his marines at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] and leave behind the 20-gun {{HMS|Acorn}} to protect the harbour.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardinier, p. 178</ref> This not only weakened the squadron but also delayed it, Maxwell's force not departing Port St. George until 19:00. It was assumed among the British squadron that the convoy comprised {{ship|French frigate|Dana\u00e9|1807|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Flore|1806|2}} and {{ship|Venetian ship|Corona||2}}, the survivors of the Battle of Lissa now sailing from [[Trieste]] to Corfu to supply the island.<ref name=\"WJ376\">James, p. 376</ref>\n\nShortly after passing the southern headland of Lissa, the British squadron encountered a neutral merchant ship that had been carrying Lieutenant John McDougal, formerly of {{HMS|Unite|1803|6}}, to [[Malta]]. McDougal had seen the French ships in passing and identified them as a convoy heading north from Corfu rather than south to it, and had ordered the merchant ship to return him to Lissa to bring warning.<ref name=\"WJ376\"/> The French convoy was under the command of Commodore Fran\u00e7ois-Gilles Montfort and consisted of three ships, the two large frigates {{ship|French frigate|Pomone|1805|2}} and {{ship|French frigate|Pauline|1807|2}} and the smaller {{ship|French ship|Persanne|1809|2}}. The convoy had departed Corfu on 16 November carrying a cargo of [[cannon]] to Trieste.<ref name=\"WJ379\"/>\n\n===Squadrons===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain Maxwell's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Ship </small>\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Rate </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Guns </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Navy </small>\n! width=25%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Commander </small>\n! width=15%; align= center colspan=3 | <small>Casualties</small>\n! width=30%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small>Notes</small>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Killed </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Wounded </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Total</small>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Alceste|1806|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 38\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain [[Murray Maxwell]]\n| align= right  | 7\n| align= right  | 13\n| align= right  | 20\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Active|1799|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 38\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain [[James Alexander Gordon]]\n| align= right  | 9\n| align= right  | 26\n| align= right  | 35\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Unite|1803|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 36\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  |Captain Edwin Henry Chamberlayne\n| align= right  | 2\n| align= right  | 4\n| align= right  | 6\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Kingfisher|1804|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Sloop-of-war|Sloop]]\n| align= center  | 18\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  |Captain Ewell Tritton\n| align= right  | 0\n| align= right  | 0\n| align= right  | 0\n| align= left  |  Independent sailor, not engaged in the action.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Casualties: 18 killed, 43 wounded, 61 total\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Commodore Montfort's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Ship </small>\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Rate </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Guns </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Navy </small>\n! width=25%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Commander </small>\n! width=15%; align= center colspan=3 | <small>Casualties</small>\n! width=30%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small>Notes</small>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Killed </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Wounded </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Total</small>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Windward Division\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{ship|French frigate|Pauline|1807|2}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 40\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|France|naval}}\n| align= left  | Commodore [[Fran\u00e7ois-Gilles Montfort]]\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | unknown\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{ship|French frigate|Pomone|1805|2}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  |  40\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|France|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain [[Claude Charles Marie du Campe de Rosamel]]\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | ~50\n| align= left  | Captured and taken to Britain, later broken up.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{ship|French ship|Persanne|1809|2}}\n| align= center  | [[Sixth rate]]\n| align= center  | 26\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|France|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain Joseph-Andr\u00e9 Satie\n| align= right  | 3\n| align= right  | 4\n| align= right  | 7\n| align= left  | Captured and sold to the [[Bey of Tunis]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Casualties: At least 50 killed and wounded\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Sources: Gardiner, p.&nbsp;178; James, p.&nbsp;378\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Key'''\n* A \u2020 symbol indicates that the officer was killed during the action or subsequently died of wounds received.\n* The ships are ordered in the sequence in which they formed up for battle.\n\n==Battle==\nCasting south close to the island of [[Lastovo|Augusta]] (Lastovo), Captain Gordon in ''Active'' sighted the French force at 09:20 on 29 November, sailing to the north-west.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> Initially the French ships held their course, but on determining that the approaching squadron was British, Montfort spread all sail to escape pursuit. By 11:00 it was evident that ''Persanne'' could not maintain the pace of the two larger frigates and so turned north-east in hopes of escaping independently. ''Active'' initially gave chase to the smaller ship, but Maxwell recalled her and sent ''Unite'' after ''Persanne'', keeping ''Active'' and ''Alceste'' in pursuit of the larger French ships.<ref name=\"WJ376\"/> At 11:50 it became clear that ''Alceste'' would soon catch the heavily laden French ships, and Maxwell sent the telegraph signal to Gordon; \"Remember the battle of Lissa\", the action of eight months before at which Hoste had raised the signal \"Remember Nelson\".<ref name=\"WJ377\"/>\n\nThe first shots were fired at 12:30 by ''Persanne'' close to the island of [[Palagru\u017ea|Pelagosa]] (Palagru\u017ea), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when ''Alceste'' and ''Pomone'' exchanged shots from their stern and bow guns.<ref name=\"WJ377\"/> By 13:40, ''Alceste'' was firing her broadside into ''Pomone'' and simultaneously pressing on all sail in an effort to reach ''Pauline'', but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from ''Pomone'' brought down ''Alceste''{{'}}s main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing ''Pauline'' to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, ''Active'' had arrived in action and was also firing into ''Pomone'', forcing Montfort to bring ''Pauline'' round to protect her outgunned colleague.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> By 14:20 the conflicts between ''Active'' and ''Pomone'' and ''Alceste'' and ''Pauline'' had separated into different duels, ''Pomone'' particularly suffering severely but ''Active'' also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder [[carronade]] shot severing Captain Gordon's leg at the height of the engagement.<ref name=\"ODNBGord\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 Gordon, Sir James Alexander] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164840/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 |date=5 March 2016 }}, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>\n\nAt 15:05 another British ship appeared on the horizon, the sloop {{HMS|Kingfisher|1804|6}}, which persuaded Montfort that he could no longer protect the battered ''Pomone'' against superior numbers.<ref name=\"WJ377\">James, p. 377</ref> ''Pauline'' set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' now concentrated their full broadsides on ''Pomone'', which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. ''Pauline'' escaped, later reaching [[Ancona]] safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.<ref name=\"WJ378\"/>\n\n===''Unite'' vs. ''Persanne''===\nThe secondary engagement of the battle was contested initially within sight of the other combatants, ''Persanne'' firing the first shots at the pursuing ''Unite'' at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that ''Unite'' caught the smaller ship.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard ''Unite'' but none on ''Persanne''. From external appearances, ''Persanne'' seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the [[fifth rate]] ''Unite'', but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, when it became clear that his ship could not outrun ''Unite'', Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.<ref name=\"WJ379\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties suffered in the action were relatively heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men killed or wounded while the French lost over 50 on ''Pomone'' alone. There were no casualties on ''Persanne'', and ''Pauline''{{'}}s losses are unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition.<ref name=\"WJ378\">James, p. 378</ref> The French also lost the cargo aboard ''Persanne'' and ''Pomone'', which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels for gun carriages and numerous other military stores.<ref name=\"WJ379\">James, p. 379</ref>\n\nPromotions were granted to the junior officers of ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' and both crews received praise and prize money for their service in the operation. Similar rewards were not made to the crew of ''Unite'', probably because ''Persanne'' was so much smaller and less-well armed than her opponent.<ref name=\"WJ380\"/> The total prize money was \u00a33,500,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16701|page=280|date=9 February 1913}}</ref> not as much as first anticipated because neither of the captured ships were of sufficient quality to warrant purchase into the Royal Navy. ''Pomone'' had been hastily built in 1803 as the personal warship of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] and as a result was of weak construction while ''Persanne'' had been designed as an armed storeship rather than a full-scale warship. Ultimately ''Pomone'' was transferred to Britain, briefly renamed {{HMS|Ambuscade}} and broken up for materials while ''Persanne'' was sold to the [[Bey of Tunis]].<ref name=\"WJ380\">James, p. 380</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the action had more significant consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon was a serious blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself took an interest in the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his [[French invasion of Russia|attention on Russia]].<ref name=\"JH153\">Henderson, p. 153</ref> In the French Navy, the flight of ''Pauline'' was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command.<ref name=\"Roche\">Roche, vol.1 p.344</ref> In 1817, when [[Murray Maxwell]] visited [[St Helena]] on his return from the East Indies where HMS ''Alceste'' had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words \"Your government must not blame you for the loss of ''Alceste'', for you have taken one of my frigates\".<ref name=\"JH161\">Henderson, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe effects on the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only confirming the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating on the construction of several new ships in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action of the year in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG179\">Gardinier, p. 179</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|Adriatic Campaign]] \n*[[Murray Maxwell]] \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Gardiner\n | first = Robert\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2001 |origyear=1998\n | chapter =\n | title = The Victory of Seapower\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84067-359-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Henderson\n | first = James\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1994\n | origyear = 1970\n | chapter = \n | title = The Frigates\n | publisher = Leo Cooper\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-85052-432-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808\u20131811\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-909-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Roche\n | first = Jean-Michel\n | authorlink =\n | year =\n | chapter =\n | title = Dictionnaire des b\u00e2timents de la flotte de guerre fran\u00e7aise de Colbert \u00e0 nos jours\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | id = ISBN\n}}\n* {{London Gazette|issue=16586|pages=565\u2013567|date=24 March 1812}} Captain Murray Maxwell's despatch concerning the action in the [[London Gazette]].\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1811]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of the Adriatic Sea]]\n[[Category:November 1811 events]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_of_29_November_1811"}
