It is a product of the diverse populations that today inhabit the continent of Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. African culture is expressed in its arts and crafts, folklore and religion, clothing, cuisine, music and languages.<ref>{{Cite web|title = African Culture and People|url = http://goafrica.about.com/od/peopleandculture/|website = About.com Travel|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref> Expressions of culture are abundant within Africa, with large amounts of cultural diversity being found not only across different countries but also within single countries. Even though African cultures are widely diverse, they are also, when closely studied, seen to have many similarities; for example, the morals they uphold, their love and respect for their culture as well as the strong respect they hold for the aged and the important, i.e. [[Monarchies in Africa|kings]] and chiefs.\n\nAfrica has influenced and been influenced by other continents. This can be portrayed in the willingness to adapt to the ever-changing modern world rather than staying rooted to their static culture. The Westernized few, persuaded by European culture and Christianity, first denied African traditional culture, but with the increase of African [[nationalism]], a cultural recovery occurred. The governments of most African nations encourage national dance and music groups, museums, and to a lower degree, artists and writers.\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Egypt bookofthedead.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sample of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[scribe]] Nebqed, c.

For Mugambi, colonial cultural hangovers, pervasive Western cultural inundation, and aid-giving arm-twisting donors are, he argues, here to stay and no amount of looking into Africa's past will make them go away. However, [[Maulana Karenga]] states:\n{{Quotation|Our culture provides us with an ethos we must honor in both thought and practice. By ethos, we mean a people's self-understanding as well as its self-presentation in the world through its thought and practice in the other six areas of culture. It is above all a cultural challenge.

African arts and crafts find expression in a variety of [[woodcarving]]s, [[brass]] and [[leather]] art works. African arts and crafts also include [[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[pottery]], [[ceremonial]] and [[religious]] [[headgear]] and [[Clothing|dress]]. [[Maulana Karenga]] states that in African art, the object was not as important as the soul force behind the creation of the object. He also states that All art must be revolutionary and in being revolutionary it must be collective, committing, and functional.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]\nCertain African cultures have always placed emphasis on personal appearance and [[jewelry]] has remained an important personal [[Fashion accessory|accessory]]. Many pieces of such jewelry are made of [[cowry]] shells and similar materials. Similarly, [[mask]]s are made with elaborate designs and are an important part of some cultures in Africa. Masks are used in various ceremonies depicting ancestors and spirits, mythological characters and deities.\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|A terra-cotta head sculpture (1100-1500) of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], showing extraordinary naturalism. This head represents the oni, or king of [[Ife]].]]\nIn many traditional arts and craft traditions in Africa, certain themes significant to those particular cultures recur, including a couple, a woman with a child, a male with a weapon or animal, and an outsider or a stranger. Couples may represent ancestors, community founder, married couple or twins. The couple theme rarely exhibits intimacy of men and women. The mother with the child or children reveals intense desire of the women to have children. The theme is also representative of mother mars and the people as her children. The man with the weapon or animal theme symbolizes honor and power. A stranger may be from some other tribe or someone from a different country, and more distorted portrayal of the stranger indicates proportionately greater gap from the stranger.\n\n==Folklore and religion==\n{{See also|African traditional religions|Religion in Africa}}\n[[File:Central mosque in Nouakchott.jpg|thumb|right|Central mosque in [[Nouakchott]], [[Mauritania]]]]\nLike all human cultures, African folklore and religion represents a variety of social facets of the various cultures in Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Like almost all civilizations and cultures, flood myths have been circulating in different parts of Africa. Culture and religion share space and are deeply intertwined in African cultures. In Ethiopia, Christianity and Islam form the core aspects of Ethiopian culture and inform dietary customs as well as rituals and rites.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, 1997, `History of the Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History, Lawrenceville, New Jersey.</ref> According to a [[Pygmy]] myth, Chameleon, hearing a strange noise in a tree, cut open its trunk and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the land.\n\n[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenya]]n boys and girls performing a traditional folklore dance]]\nFolktales also play an important role in many African cultures. Stories reflect a group cultural identity and preserving the stories of Africa will help preserve an entire culture. Storytelling affirms pride and identity in a culture. In Africa, stories are created by and for the ethnic group telling them. Different ethnic groups in Africa have different rituals or ceremonies for storytelling, which creates a sense of belonging to a cultural group. To outsiders hearing an ethnic group's stories, it provides an insight into the community's beliefs, views, and customs. For people within the community, it allows them to encompass their group's uniqueness. They show the human desires and fears of a group, such as love, marriage, and death. Folktales are also seen as a tool for education and entertainment. They provide a way for children to understand the material and social environment. Every story has a moral to teach people, such as goodwill prevail over evil. For entertainment, stories are set in fantastic, non-human worlds. Often, the main character of the story would be a talking animal or something unnatural would happen to a human character. Even though folktales are for entertainment, they bring a sense of belonging and pride to communities in Africa.<ref>Florence, Namulundah. The Bukusu of Kenya: Folktales, Culture and Social Identities. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\nThere are different types of African stories: animal tales and day-to-day tales. Animal tales more oriented towards entertainment, but still have morals and lessons to them. Animal tales are normally divided into trickster tales and ogre tales. In the animal tales, a certain animal would always have the same character or role in each story so the audience does not have to worry about characterization. The Hare was always the trickster, clever and cunning, while the Hyena was always being tricked by the Hare. Ogres are always cruel, greedy monsters. The messengers in all the stories were the Birds. Day-to-Day tales are the most serious tales, never including humor, that explained the everyday life and struggles of an African community. These tales take on matters such as famine, escape from death, courtship, and family matters, using a song form when the climax of the story was being told.\n\nAfrican stories all have a certain structure to them. Villagers would gather around a common meeting place at the end of the day to listen and tell their stories. Storytellers had certain commands to start and end the stories, \"Ugai Itha\" to get the audience's attention and begin the story, and \"Rukirika\" to signal the end of a tale. Each scene of a story is depicted with two characters at a time, so the audience does not get overwhelmed. In each story, victims are able to overcome their predators and take justice out on the culprit. Certain tools were used in African folktales. For example, idiophones, such as drums, were used to make the sounds of different animals. Repetition and call-back techniques in the form of prose or poem were also used to get the audience involved in the stories.<ref>Mwangi, Rose. Kikuyu Folktales.

The latter garment is basically cotton cloth, about 90&nbsp; cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the [[Textile|fabric]] for an elegant effect. Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white [[collar (clothing)|collar]], and perhaps a sweater. Men often wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the ''netela''.\n[[File:Traditional Maasai Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Maasai wearing traditional clothes named ''Matavuvale'' while performing [[African dance#Examples|Adumu]], a traditional dance]]\n\nZulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern westernised clothing for everyday use. Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the ''umutsha'' (pronounced {{IPA-zu|umtifash}}), and is usually made of [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]] or other animal hide twisted into different bands which cover the genitals. The rear piece, called the ''ibheshu'' {{IPA|[ibe\u02d0\u0283u]}}, is made of a single piece of springbok or [[cattle]] hide, and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the ''umqhele'' {{IPA|[um\u01c3\u02b0\u025ble]}}, which is usually also made of springbok hide, or [[leopard]] hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called ''imishokobezi'' {{IPA|[imi\u0283o\u0260o\u0253\u025b\u02d0zi]}} during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.\n\nIn the Muslim parts of Africa, daily attire also often reflects Islamic tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|African cuisine}}\n[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fufu]]'' (right) is a staple meal in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. It is served here with some [[peanut soup]].]]\nThe various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available [[fruit]]s, [[cereal grain]]s and [[vegetable]]s, as well as [[milk]] and [[meat]] products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.) |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216154309/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However it is important to consider the affordability of and access of these products on daily basis.\n\nIn [[Central Africa]], the basic ingredients are plantains and cassava. [[Fufu]]-like starchy foods (usually made from fermented cassava roots) are served with grilled meat and sauces. A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes like [[spinach]] stew, cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter. Cassava plants are also consumed as cooked [[Leaf vegetable|greens]]. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[okra]], [[ginger]], and other spices. Another favorite is Bambara, a [[porridge]] of rice, peanut butter, and sugar. Beef and chicken are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing [[crocodile]], [[monkey]], [[antelope]] and [[warthog]] are also served occasionally.\n[[File:Cuscus.jpg|thumb|left|Fresh [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] ''[[couscous]]'' with vegetables and chickpeas]]\n\nThe cuisine of the [[African Great Lakes]] region varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive in that meat products are generally absent. [[Cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were regarded as a form of [[currency]] and a store of wealth, and are not generally consumed as food. In some areas, traditional peoples consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other peoples are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. [[Maize]] (corn) is the basis of [[ugali]], the East African version of West Africa's [[fufu]]. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In [[Uganda]], steamed, green [[banana]]s called [[matoke]] provide the starch filler of many meals.\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the main traditional dishes in [[Ethiopian cuisine]] and [[Eritrean cuisine]] are ''[[Wat (food)|tsebhis]]'' (stews) served with ''[[injera]]''<ref name=\"webcitation\">[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/WARSAISANDIEGO/our_culture.htm&date=2009-10-25+11:44:57 \"Eritrean Food Practices.\"] [https://www.webcitation.org Webcitation.org]. Accessed July 2011.</ref> (flatbread made from [[teff]],<ref name=\"webcitation\"/> [[wheat]], or [[sorghum]]), and hilbet (paste made from [[legume]]s, mainly [[lentil]], [[Vicia faba|faba beans]]). Eritrean and [[Ethiopian cuisine]] (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries. The related [[Somali cuisine]] consists of an exotic [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of diverse culinary influences. Varieties of ''bariis'' (rice), the most popular probably being [[basmati]], usually serve as the main dish. ''Xalwo'' (halwo) or [[halva]] is a popular confection served during special occasions such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions.<ref>Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan'') or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''), which is prepared inside an [[Censer|incense burner]] referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''. All food is served [[halal]].\n[[File:Potjiekos2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Potjiekos]]'' is a traditional [[Afrikaner]] stew made with meat and vegetables and cooked over coals in [[cast-iron]] pots.]]\n\nThe roots of [[North African cuisine]] can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa, particularly in Egypt where many of the country's dishes and culinary traditions date back to ancient Egypt. Over several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. Most of the North African countries today have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan ''tangia'' and the Tunisian ''coucha'' are both essentially the same dish: a meat stew prepared in an [[urn]] and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. To add to the confusion, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a \"tajine\" dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian \"tajine\" is a baked [[omelette]]/[[quiche]]-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations &ndash; there's the sophisticated, full-bodied flavours of [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan palace cookery]], the fiery dishes of [[Tunisian cuisine]], and the humbler, simpler cuisines of [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Foods of North Africa |url=http://www.specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |first=Paula |last=Wolfert |publisher=[[National Association for the Specialty Food Trade]], Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021074848/http://specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |archivedate=2007-10-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe cooking of Southern Africa is sometimes called 'rainbow cuisine', as the food in this region is a blend of many culinary traditions, including those of the [[Khoisan people|Khoisan]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] populations. Basic ingredients include seafood, meat products (including wild game), poultry, as well as grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits include [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, [[mango]]es, [[banana]]s and [[papaya]]s, [[avocado]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[peach]]es and [[apricot]]s. Desserts may simply be fruit. However, there are some more western style puddings, such as the Angolan [[Cocada amarela]], which was inspired by [[Portuguese cuisine]]. Meat products include lamb, as well as game like [[venison]], [[ostrich]], and [[impala]]. The seafood includes a wide variety such as [[crayfish]], [[prawn]]s, [[tuna]], [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, calamari, [[mackerel]], and [[lobster]]. There are also several types of traditional and modern [[alcoholic beverage]]s including many European-style [[beer]]s.\n\nA typical West African meal is heavy with [[starch]]y items, meat, spices, and flavors. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including those of Fufu, [[Banku]] and [[Kenkey]] (originating from [[Ghana]]), Foutou, [[Couscous]], T\u00f4, and [[Garri]], which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy [[root vegetable]]s such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Xanthosoma|cocoyams]], or [[cassava]], but also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains. The staple grain or starch varies region to region and ethnic group to ethnic group, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and Kenkey are maize dough staples, and Gari is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice-dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry [[Sahel]] belt inland. Examples of these include [[Benachin]] from [[The Gambia]] and [[Jollof rice]], a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab [[kabsah]].\n\n==African music==\n{{See also|African popular music|Music of Africa}}\n[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[drum]]mers at celebration in Ojumo Oro, [[Kwara State]], [[Nigeria]]]]\nTraditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered on the drums, and indeed, a large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], is rhythmic and centered on the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspects of Sub-Saharan music were transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as [[Samba]], [[Jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Rock & Roll]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], and [[Rap]] music.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bowden, Rob(2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 40, {{ISBN|1-4034-9910-1}}.</ref>\n\nOther African musical traditions also involve strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern Sahel and along the Nile, among the [[Nilo-Saharan]], made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Dancing involve swaying body movements and footwork. Among the [[Khoisan]]s extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork.<ref>[[Christopher Ehret]], (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-8139-2085-X}}.</ref>\n\nModern Sub-Saharan African music has been influenced by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.). Popular styles include [[Mbalax]] in [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]], [[Highlife]] in [[Ghana]], [[Zoblazo]] in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[Makossa]] in [[Cameroon]], [[Soukous]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Kizomba]] in [[Angola]], and [[Mbaqanga]] in [[South Africa]].

For Mugambi, colonial cultural hangovers, pervasive Western cultural inundation, and aid-giving arm-twisting donors are, he argues, here to stay and no amount of looking into Africa's past will make them go away. However, [[Maulana Karenga]] states:\n{{Quotation|Our culture provides us with an ethos we must honor in both thought and practice.

African arts and crafts also include [[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[pottery]], [[ceremonial]] and [[religious]] [[headgear]] and [[Clothing|dress]]. [[Maulana Karenga]] states that in African art, the object was not as important as the soul force behind the creation of the object. He also states that All art must be revolutionary and in being revolutionary it must be collective, committing, and functional.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]\nCertain African cultures have always placed emphasis on personal appearance and [[jewelry]] has remained an important personal [[Fashion accessory|accessory]]. Many pieces of such jewelry are made of [[cowry]] shells and similar materials. Similarly, [[mask]]s are made with elaborate designs and are an important part of some cultures in Africa. Masks are used in various ceremonies depicting ancestors and spirits, mythological characters and deities.\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|A terra-cotta head sculpture (1100-1500) of the [[Yoruba]], showing extraordinary naturalism. This head represents the oni, or king of [[Ife]].]]\nIn many traditional arts and craft traditions in Africa, certain themes significant to those particular cultures recur, including a couple, a woman with a child, a male with a weapon or animal, and an outsider or a stranger. Couples may represent ancestors, community founder, married couple or twins. The couple theme rarely exhibits intimacy of men and women. The mother with the child or children reveals intense desire of the women to have children. The theme is also representative of mother mars and the people as her children. The man with the weapon or animal theme symbolizes honor and power. A stranger may be from some other tribe or someone from a different country, and more distorted portrayal of the stranger indicates proportionately greater gap from the stranger.\n\n==Folklore and religion==\n{{See also|African traditional religions|Religion in Africa}}\n[[File:Central mosque in Nouakchott.jpg|thumb|right|Central mosque in [[Nouakchott]], [[Mauritania]]]]\nLike all human cultures, African folklore and religion represents a variety of social facets of the various cultures in Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Like almost all civilizations and cultures, flood myths have been circulating in different parts of Africa. Culture and religion share space and are deeply intertwined in African cultures. In Ethiopia, Christianity and Islam form the core aspects of Ethiopian culture and inform dietary customs as well as rituals and rites.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, 1997, `History of the Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History, Lawrenceville, New Jersey.</ref> According to a [[Pygmy]] myth, Chameleon, hearing a strange noise in a tree, cut open its trunk and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the land.\n\n[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenya]]n boys and girls performing a traditional folklore dance]]\nFolktales also play an important role in many African cultures. Stories reflect a group cultural identity and preserving the stories of Africa will help preserve an entire culture. Storytelling affirms pride and identity in a culture. In Africa, stories are created by and for the ethnic group telling them. Different ethnic groups in Africa have different rituals or ceremonies for storytelling, which creates a sense of belonging to a cultural group. To outsiders hearing an ethnic group's stories, it provides an insight into the community's beliefs, views, and customs. For people within the community, it allows them to encompass their group's uniqueness. They show the human desires and fears of a group, such as love, marriage, and death. Folktales are also seen as a tool for education and entertainment. They provide a way for children to understand the material and social environment. Every story has a moral to teach people, such as goodwill prevail over evil. For entertainment, stories are set in fantastic, non-human worlds. Often, the main character of the story would be a talking animal or something unnatural would happen to a human character. Even though folktales are for entertainment, they bring a sense of belonging and pride to communities in Africa.<ref>Florence, Namulundah. The Bukusu of Kenya: Folktales, Culture and Social Identities. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\nThere are different types of African stories: animal tales and day-to-day tales. Animal tales more oriented towards entertainment, but still have morals and lessons to them. Animal tales are normally divided into trickster tales and ogre tales. In the animal tales, a certain animal would always have the same character or role in each story so the audience does not have to worry about characterization. The Hare was always the trickster, clever and cunning, while the Hyena was always being tricked by the Hare. Ogres are always cruel, greedy monsters. The messengers in all the stories were the Birds. Day-to-Day tales are the most serious tales, never including humor, that explained the everyday life and struggles of an African community. These tales take on matters such as famine, escape from death, courtship, and family matters, using a song form when the climax of the story was being told.\n\nAfrican stories all have a certain structure to them. Villagers would gather around a common meeting place at the end of the day to listen and tell their stories. Storytellers had certain commands to start and end the stories, \"Ugai Itha\" to get the audience's attention and begin the story, and \"Rukirika\" to signal the end of a tale. Each scene of a story is depicted with two characters at a time, so the audience does not get overwhelmed. In each story, victims are able to overcome their predators and take justice out on the culprit. Certain tools were used in African folktales. For example, idiophones, such as drums, were used to make the sounds of different animals. Repetition and call-back techniques in the form of prose or poem were also used to get the audience involved in the stories.<ref>Mwangi, Rose. Kikuyu Folktales.

The latter garment is basically cotton cloth, about 90&nbsp; cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the [[Textile|fabric]] for an elegant effect. Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white [[collar (clothing)|collar]], and perhaps a sweater. Men often wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the ''netela''.\n[[File:Traditional Maasai Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Maasai wearing traditional clothes named ''Matavuvale'' while performing [[African dance#Examples|Adumu]], a traditional dance]]\n\nZulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern westernised clothing for everyday use. Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the ''umutsha'' (pronounced {{IPA-zu|umtifash}}), and is usually made of [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]] or other animal hide twisted into different bands which cover the genitals. The rear piece, called the ''ibheshu'' {{IPA|[ibe\u02d0\u0283u]}}, is made of a single piece of springbok or [[cattle]] hide, and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the ''umqhele'' {{IPA|[um\u01c3\u02b0\u025ble]}}, which is usually also made of springbok hide, or [[leopard]] hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called ''imishokobezi'' {{IPA|[imi\u0283o\u0260o\u0253\u025b\u02d0zi]}} during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.\n\nIn the Muslim parts of Africa, daily attire also often reflects Islamic tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|African cuisine}}\n[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fufu]]'' (right) is a staple meal in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. It is served here with some [[peanut soup]].]]\nThe various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available [[fruit]]s, [[cereal grain]]s and [[vegetable]]s, as well as [[milk]] and [[meat]] products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.) |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216154309/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However it is important to consider the affordability of and access of these products on daily basis.\n\nIn [[Central Africa]], the basic ingredients are plantains and cassava. [[Fufu]]-like starchy foods (usually made from fermented cassava roots) are served with grilled meat and sauces. A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes like [[spinach]] stew, cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter. Cassava plants are also consumed as cooked [[Leaf vegetable|greens]]. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[okra]], [[ginger]], and other spices. Another favorite is Bambara, a [[porridge]] of rice, peanut butter, and sugar. Beef and chicken are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing [[crocodile]], [[monkey]], [[antelope]] and [[warthog]] are also served occasionally.\n[[File:Cuscus.jpg|thumb|left|Fresh [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] ''[[couscous]]'' with vegetables and chickpeas]]\n\nThe cuisine of the [[African Great Lakes]] region varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive in that meat products are generally absent. [[Cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were regarded as a form of [[currency]] and a store of wealth, and are not generally consumed as food. In some areas, traditional peoples consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other peoples are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. [[Maize]] (corn) is the basis of [[ugali]], the East African version of West Africa's [[fufu]]. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In [[Uganda]], steamed, green [[banana]]s called [[matoke]] provide the starch filler of many meals.\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the main traditional dishes in [[Ethiopian cuisine]] and [[Eritrean cuisine]] are ''[[Wat (food)|tsebhis]]'' (stews) served with ''[[injera]]''<ref name=\"webcitation\">[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/WARSAISANDIEGO/our_culture.htm&date=2009-10-25+11:44:57 \"Eritrean Food Practices.\"] [https://www.webcitation.org Webcitation.org].

Eritrean and [[Ethiopian cuisine]] (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries. The related [[Somali cuisine]] consists of an exotic [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of diverse culinary influences. Varieties of ''bariis'' (rice), the most popular probably being [[basmati]], usually serve as the main dish. ''Xalwo'' (halwo) or [[halva]] is a popular confection served during special occasions such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions.<ref>Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan'') or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''), which is prepared inside an [[Censer|incense burner]] referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''. All food is served [[halal]].\n[[File:Potjiekos2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Potjiekos]]'' is a traditional [[Afrikaner]] stew made with meat and vegetables and cooked over coals in [[cast-iron]] pots.]]\n\nThe roots of [[North African cuisine]] can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa, particularly in Egypt where many of the country's dishes and culinary traditions date back to ancient Egypt. Over several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. Most of the North African countries today have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan ''tangia'' and the Tunisian ''coucha'' are both essentially the same dish: a meat stew prepared in an [[urn]] and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. To add to the confusion, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a \"tajine\" dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian \"tajine\" is a baked [[omelette]]/[[quiche]]-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations &ndash; there's the sophisticated, full-bodied flavours of [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan palace cookery]], the fiery dishes of [[Tunisian cuisine]], and the humbler, simpler cuisines of [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Foods of North Africa |url=http://www.specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |first=Paula |last=Wolfert |publisher=[[National Association for the Specialty Food Trade]], Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021074848/http://specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |archivedate=2007-10-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe cooking of Southern Africa is sometimes called 'rainbow cuisine', as the food in this region is a blend of many culinary traditions, including those of the [[Khoisan people|Khoisan]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] populations. Basic ingredients include seafood, meat products (including wild game), poultry, as well as grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits include [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, [[mango]]es, [[banana]]s and [[papaya]]s, [[avocado]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[peach]]es and [[apricot]]s. Desserts may simply be fruit. However, there are some more western style puddings, such as the Angolan [[Cocada amarela]], which was inspired by [[Portuguese cuisine]]. Meat products include lamb, as well as game like [[venison]], [[ostrich]], and [[impala]]. The seafood includes a wide variety such as [[crayfish]], [[prawn]]s, [[tuna]], [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, calamari, [[mackerel]], and [[lobster]]. There are also several types of traditional and modern [[alcoholic beverage]]s including many European-style [[beer]]s.\n\nA typical West African meal is heavy with [[starch]]y items, meat, spices, and flavors. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including those of Fufu, [[Banku]] and [[Kenkey]] (originating from [[Ghana]]), Foutou, [[Couscous]], T\u00f4, and [[Garri]], which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy [[root vegetable]]s such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Xanthosoma|cocoyams]], or [[cassava]], but also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains. The staple grain or starch varies region to region and ethnic group to ethnic group, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and Kenkey are maize dough staples, and Gari is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice-dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry [[Sahel]] belt inland. Examples of these include [[Benachin]] from [[The Gambia]] and [[Jollof rice]], a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab [[kabsah]].\n\n==African music==\n{{See also|African popular music|Music of Africa}}\n[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[drum]]mers at celebration in Ojumo Oro, [[Kwara State]], [[Nigeria]]]]\nTraditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered on the drums, and indeed, a large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], is rhythmic and centered on the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspects of Sub-Saharan music were transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as [[Samba]], [[Jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Rock & Roll]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], and [[Rap]] music.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bowden, Rob(2007).

He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:\n<blockquote>My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing.<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself,<ref>Haehl, vol. 1, p.38; Dudgeon, p.48</ref> he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: \"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.\"<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name [[homeopathy]]. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay ''Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice'', published in [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Hufeland]]'s ''Journal'' in 1807.<ref>Gumpert, Martin (1945) ''Hahnemann: The Adventurous Career of a Medical Rebel'', New York: Fischer, p. 130.</ref>\n\n=== Development of homeopathy ===\nFollowing up the work of the Viennese physician [[Anton von St\u00f6rck]], Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von St\u00f6rck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von St\u00f6rck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states,<ref>Dudgeon, pp.xxi\u2013xxii; Cook, p.95</ref> and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal \"law of similars\".<ref>Dudgeon, p.49 & p.176; Haehl, vol. 1, p.40</ref> He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of \"potentization\" using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick.

Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 \"Organon of the Rational Art of Healing\", followed over the years by four further editions entitled ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th ''Organon'' edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death.

He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:\n<blockquote>My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing.<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself,<ref>Haehl, vol. 1, p.38; Dudgeon, p.48</ref> he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: \"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.\"<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name [[homeopathy]]. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay ''Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice'', published in [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Hufeland]]'s ''Journal'' in 1807.<ref>Gumpert, Martin (1945) ''Hahnemann: The Adventurous Career of a Medical Rebel'', New York: Fischer, p. 130.</ref>\n\n=== Development of homeopathy ===\nFollowing up the work of the Viennese physician [[Anton von St\u00f6rck]], Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von St\u00f6rck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von St\u00f6rck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states,<ref>Dudgeon, pp.xxi\u2013xxii; Cook, p.95</ref> and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal \"law of similars\".<ref>Dudgeon, p.49 & p.176; Haehl, vol. 1, p.40</ref> He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of \"potentization\" using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic  experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800\u201301 when, on the basis of his \"law of similars,\" he had begun using ''[[Ipecacuanha]]'' for the treatment of coughs and [[Belladonna (plant)|Belladonna]] for scarlet fever.<ref>Cook, pp.96\u20137; Dudgeon, pp.338\u2013340 & pp.394\u2013408</ref>\n\nHe first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a [[German-language]] medical journal in 1796. Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 \"Organon of the Rational Art of Healing\", followed over the years by four further editions entitled ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th ''Organon'' edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death. It consisted  of a 5th ''Organon'' containing extensive handwritten annotations.<ref>[http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm Sixth Organon book review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021000237/http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm |date=21 October 2010 }}.

As required by the university statutes, to become a faculty member he was required to submit and defend a thesis on a medical topic of his choice. On 26 June 1812, Hahnemann presented a [[Latin]] thesis, entitled ''\"A Medical Historical Dissertation on the Helleborism of the Ancients.\"''<ref>Bradford, p. 93.</ref> His thesis very thoroughly examined the historical literature and sought  to differentiate between the ancient use of ''[[Helleborus niger]]'', or black hellebore, and the medicinal uses of the \"white hellebore\", botanically ''[[Veratrum album]]'', both of which are poisonous plants.<ref>Haehl, Vol. 2, p. 96.</ref>\n\nHahnemann continued practicing and researching homeopathy, as well as writing and lecturing for the rest of his life.

Leopold emigrated to England, and he practised homeopathy in London. He retired to the [[Isle of Wight]] and died there at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Dr Leopold Suss-Hahnemann's youngest daughter, Amalia, had two children, Winifred (born in 1898) and Herbert. William Herbert Tankard-Hahnemann (1922\u20132009) was Winifred's son. He served as a Major in the British Army during World War II, and then had a career in the city of London. He was at one point appointed as a Freeman of the City of London.

The highest polling of any runner-up, by percentage, was [[Thomas George Jones]] in 1931, winning 30.8% of the votes cast, 0.3% more than the half-total of the winning candidate and in an election when the pre-[[World War II]] Labour Party's vote was slightly split by the presence of a prominent Communist Party candidate and editor, [[J. R. Campbell (communist)|Johnny Campbell]], the government's ceasing of prosecution of whom in 1924 led to a General Election.\n\n;Turnout\nTurnout at general elections has ranged between 85.3% in 1950

Preceded by the single \"[[In Between Days]]\" which had reached No. 15 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=charts /> ''The Head on the Door'' was described by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' as \"a collection of pop songs\".<ref name=steve /> With its variety of styles, it allowed the group to reach a wider audience in both Europe and North America. In the United Kingdom, it became their most successful album to date, entering the albums chart at No. 7 on 7 September.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/the-head-on-the-door/|title=The Head on the Door|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe album is the first to feature drummer [[Boris Williams]]. Bassist [[Simon Gallup]], who had previously worked on three major Cure albums of the early 1980s, was called back before the recording. In 1985, the band became a quintet with instrumentalist [[Porl Thompson]] as their fifth official member. ''The Head on the Door'' is the first Cure album where all the songs were composed solely by singer and guitarist [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]].\n\n==History and music==\nThis album marks the return of [[Simon Gallup]] in the group; he had performed and composed with [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] and [[Lol Tolhurst]] on the dark trilogy ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'', ''[[Faith (The Cure album)|Faith]]'' and ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]''. Guitarist [[Porl Thompson]], who had played guitar during the very early days of the band, and also played keyboards and saxophone during ''[[The Top (album)|The Top]]'' tour, became an official member. Drummer [[Boris Williams]], who had previously worked with [[Thompson Twins]], finally joined the ensemble after playing with the band during the US leg of the 1984 tour.\n\nDuring promotion for the record, Smith stated that it was inspired by the albums ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and ''[[Dare (album)|Dare]]'' by [[the Human League]]. He wanted the album to be eclectic with different styles and moods: \"It reminds me of the ''Kaleidoscope'' album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colours\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Suitable Case for Treatment |work=[[Melody Maker]] |date=17 August 1985 |last=Sutherland |first=Steve}}</ref> \"Kyoto Song\" contains an oriental hook while \"The Blood\" is played in a [[flamenco]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=cure |title=Cure |work=[[Trouser Press]] |accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref> The piano tune of \"Six Different Ways\" was previously used by Smith during his tenure with Siouxsie and the Banshees, for the single \"[[Swimming Horses]]\".<ref name=mirror>{{cite journal |title=The Cure: ''The Head on the Door'' |work=[[Record Mirror]] |date=31 August 1985 |last=Strickland |first=Andy}}</ref> The last song of the album, \"Sinking\", was reminiscent of the band's ''Faith'' era, while \"[[Close to Me (The Cure song)|Close to Me]]\" was described as a \"[[disco]] thing\" by critics.<ref name=steve>{{cite journal |title=Head Case |work=[[Melody Maker]] |date=31 August 1985 |last=Sutherland |first=Steve}}</ref> The opening track and first single, \"[[In Between Days]]\", was compared to [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s material.<ref name=sounds>{{cite journal |title=Sox Appeal |date=31 August 1985 |work=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |last=Roberts |first=Chris}}</ref> \"A Night Like This\" contains a saxophone solo by Ron Howe from [[Fools Dance]].

Preceded by the single \"[[In Between Days]]\" which had reached No. 15 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=charts /> ''The Head on the Door'' was described by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' as \"a collection of pop songs\".<ref name=steve /> With its variety of styles, it allowed the group to reach a wider audience in both Europe and North America. In the United Kingdom, it became their most successful album to date, entering the albums chart at No. 7 on 7 September.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/the-head-on-the-door/|title=The Head on the Door|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe album is the first to feature drummer [[Boris Williams]]. Bassist [[Simon Gallup]], who had previously worked on three major Cure albums of the early 1980s, was called back before the recording. In 1985, the band became a quintet with instrumentalist [[Porl Thompson]] as their fifth official member. ''The Head on the Door'' is the first Cure album where all the songs were composed solely by singer and guitarist [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]].\n\n==History and music==\nThis album marks the return of [[Simon Gallup]] in the group; he had performed and composed with [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] and [[Lol Tolhurst]] on the dark trilogy ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'', ''[[Faith (The Cure album)|Faith]]'' and ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]''. Guitarist [[Porl Thompson]], who had played guitar during the very early days of the band, and also played keyboards and saxophone during ''[[The Top (album)|The Top]]'' tour, became an official member. Drummer [[Boris Williams]], who had previously worked with [[Thompson Twins]], finally joined the ensemble after playing with the band during the US leg of the 1984 tour.\n\nDuring promotion for the record, Smith stated that it was inspired by the albums ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and ''[[Dare (album)|Dare]]'' by [[the Human League]]. He wanted the album to be eclectic with different styles and moods: \"It reminds me of the ''Kaleidoscope'' album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colours\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Suitable Case for Treatment |work=[[Melody Maker]] |date=17 August 1985 |last=Sutherland |first=Steve}}</ref> \"Kyoto Song\" contains an oriental hook while \"The Blood\" is played in a [[flamenco]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=cure |title=Cure |work=[[Trouser Press]] |accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref> The piano tune of \"Six Different Ways\" was previously used by Smith during his tenure with Siouxsie and the Banshees, for the single \"[[Swimming Horses]]\".<ref name=mirror>{{cite journal |title=The Cure: ''The Head on the Door'' |work=[[Record Mirror]] |date=31 August 1985 |last=Strickland |first=Andy}}</ref> The last song of the album, \"Sinking\", was reminiscent of the band's ''Faith'' era, while \"[[Close to Me (The Cure song)|Close to Me]]\" was described as a \"[[disco]] thing\" by critics.<ref name=steve>{{cite journal |title=Head Case |work=[[Melody Maker]] |date=31 August 1985 |last=Sutherland |first=Steve}}</ref> The opening track and first single, \"[[In Between Days]]\", was compared to [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s material.<ref name=sounds>{{cite journal |title=Sox Appeal |date=31 August 1985 |work=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |last=Roberts |first=Chris}}</ref> \"A Night Like This\" contains a saxophone solo by Ron Howe from [[Fools Dance]].

The festival included light sporting activities and musical acts, in addition to the cook-off.<ref name=\"Spamarama\">{{cite web\n| title=Spamarama website\n| url=http://www.Spamarama.org/\n| accessdate=August 11, 2006}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Nutritional data==\n[[File:Spam 2.jpg|thumb|A can of low-salt \"Spam 25% Less Sodium\"]]\n[[File:Spam Can Nutritional Label.jpg|thumb|Nutritional label for \"Spam 25% Less Sodium\"]]\nThe ingredients of Spam vary according to variety and market; those of variety \"Spam Classic\" are: pork, ham, salt, water, potato starch, sugar, and sodium nitrite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spam.com/spam-101/what-is-spam-classic|title=What is Spam Classic?|website=Spam.com|publisher=Hormel Foods|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150617231636/http://www.spam.com/spam%2D101/what%2Dis%2Dspam%2Dclassic|archive-date=June 17, 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Nutritional Information for Original Spam<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c20Nk.html|title=Nutritional Facts and Analysis for Spam|publisher=Nutritiondata.com|accessdate= July 5, 2013}}</ref>'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|\nNet weight per package: 340 grams (12 oz.)\n\nServing size: 100g\n|-\n!\n!Quantity per 100g\n|-\n| Energy || 1,300 kJ (310 [[Food energy|Calories or kilocalories]])\n|-\n| [[Protein]] || 13g (26% Daily Value or DV)\n|-\n| Total Fat || 27g (41% DV)\n|-\n| &emsp; \u2013 [[saturated fat]] || 10g (49% DV)\n|-\n| [[Carbohydrate]]s || 3g (1% DV)\n|-\n| Sodium || 1369&nbsp;mg (57% DV)\n|-\n| Cholesterol|| 70&nbsp;mg (23% DV)\n|-\n| [[Vitamin]]s and [[Dietary mineral|Minerals]] (% DV)|| 1% Vitamin C, 1% Calcium, 5% Iron,\n\n3% Magnesium, 9% Potassium, 12% Zinc,\n\nand 5% Copper\n|}\n\n==Varieties==\nAs listed on the official Spam website, there are numerous different flavors of Spam products, including:\n* Spam Classic \u2013 original flavor\n* Spam Hot & Spicy \u2013 with [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco]] flavor\n* Jalape\u00f1o Spam\n* Spam with Black Pepper\n* Spam Low Sodium \u2013 \"25% less sodium\"\n* Spam Lite \u2013 \"33% fewer calories, 25% less sodium, and 50% less fat\" \u2013 made from pork with ham, and mechanically separated chicken\n* Spam Oven Roasted Turkey\n* Spam Hickory Smoked\n* Spam Spread \u2013 \"if you're a spreader, not a slicer&nbsp;... just like Spam Classic, but in a spreadable form\"\n* Spam Bacon\n* Spam Cheese\n* Spam Garlic\n* Spam Teriyaki\n* Spam Chorizo \n* Spam Boricua \u2013 seasoned Puerto Rican-style flavor\n* Spam Macadamia Nuts \u2013 Partnered with Hamakua Plantation\n* Spam Turkey\n* Spam Tocino\n* Spam Portuguese Sausage\n*[[Pumpkin Spice Spam|Spam Pumpkin Spice]] - limited edition variety released in late September 2019\n* In addition to the variety of flavors, Spam is sold in tins smaller than the twelve-ounce standard size.

At a 1992 event at Lee's Church, Third Day performed alongside a band called the Bullard Family Singers, which featured David Carr and Tai Anderson. Third Day invited Carr and Anderson to join them shortly after.<ref name=\"Third Day\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the band started playing more frequently in the [[Atlanta]] region in order to save money to record an album.

Upon hearing Brad Avery play with singer Chris Carder, Avery was asked to audition. After playing ''Consuming Fire'' during the first rehearsal, Avery was officially asked to join the band.\n\nThe band's second album, ''Contagious'', was self-financed for $3,000 and recorded at Furies Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. 1,000 CDs and cassette copies of the demo were released. While playing in Marietta, at the Strand Theatre, the owners offered the band a contract to sign with new independent record label Gray Dot Records.
