However, the Air Force's leadership understood that its budget would not allow it to purchase enough F-15 aircraft to satisfy all of its missions.<ref>Bjorkman, Eileen, Small fast and in your face, Air & Space, Feb/March 2014, pp. 28\u201335</ref> The Advanced Day Fighter concept, renamed ''F-XX'', gained civilian political support under the reform-minded Deputy Secretary of Defense [[David Packard]], who favored the idea of competitive [[prototype|prototyping]]. As a result, in May 1971, the Air Force Prototype Study Group was established, with Boyd a key member, and two of its six proposals would be funded, one being the [[Lightweight Fighter program|Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF). The [[Request for Proposal]]s issued on 6 January 1972 called for a {{convert|20000|lb|kg|sigfig =2|adj =mid}} class air-to-air day fighter with a good turn rate, acceleration, and range, and optimized for combat at speeds of Mach 0.6\u20131.6 and altitudes of {{convert|30000|\u2013|40000|ft|sigfig=2}}. This was the region where USAF studies predicted most future air combat would occur. The anticipated average flyaway cost of a production version was $3&nbsp;million.  This production plan, though, was only notional, as the USAF had no firm plans to procure the winner.<ref>Peacock 1997, pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 7\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Selection of finalists and flyoff====\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|A right-side view of a YF-16 (foreground) and a [[Northrop YF-17]], each armed with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles|alt=Two jet aircraft flying together over mountain range and cloud]]\n\nFive companies responded, and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase. GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth $37.9&nbsp;million and $39.8&nbsp;million to produce the YF-16 and [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]], respectively, with first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974. To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the ''Fighter Mafia'' and other LWF proponents successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix. The \"high/low mix\" would allow the USAF to be able to afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements. The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes' flyoff, defining the relationship of the LWF and the F-15.<ref>Peacock 1997, pp. 10\u201311.</ref><ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe YF-16 was developed by a team of General Dynamics engineers led by [[Robert H.

Its 90-minute [[maiden flight]] was made at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at [[Edwards AFB]], California, on 2 February 1974. Its actual first flight occurred accidentally during a high-speed taxi test on 20 January 1974. While gathering speed, a roll-control oscillation caused a fin of the port-side wingtip-mounted missile and then the starboard [[stabilator]] to scrape the ground, and the aircraft then began to veer off the runway. The test pilot, Phil Oestricher, decided to lift off to avoid a potential crash, safely landing six minutes later. The slight damage was quickly repaired and the official first flight occurred on time. The YF-16's first supersonic flight was accomplished on 5 February 1974, and the second YF-16 prototype first flew on 9 May 1974. This was followed by the first flights of Northrop's YF-17 prototypes on 9 June and 21 August 1974, respectively. During the flyoff, the YF-16s completed 330 [[sorties]] for a total of 417 flight hours;<ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> the YF-17s flew 288 sorties, covering 345 hours.<ref>Jenkins 2000, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===Air Combat Fighter competition===\nIncreased interest turned the LWF into a serious acquisition program. [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) allies [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] were seeking to replace their [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104G Starfighter]] [[fighter-bomber]]s.<ref>Osborne, Phil, Executive Producer. \"F-16 Fighting Falcon\" (video #9-315842-037444).

The USAF also needed to replace its [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter-bombers. The U.S. Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program that would be a navalized fighter-bomber variant of the LWF. The four NATO allies had formed the \"Multinational Fighter Program Group\" (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S. decision by December 1974; thus, the USAF accelerated testing.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 14\u201315, 19\u201320.</ref><ref name=Richardson_p14/><ref name=Peacock_p12-3/>\n\n[[File:YF-16 VASC.JPG|thumb|YF-16 on display at the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]]]]\nTo reflect this serious intent to procure a new fighter-bomber, the LWF program was rolled into a new Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition in an announcement by [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[James R.

On 11 September 1974, the U.S. Air Force confirmed plans to order the winning ACF design to equip five tactical fighter wings.  Though computer modeling predicted a close contest, the YF-16 proved significantly quicker going from one maneuver to the next, and was the unanimous choice of those pilots that flew both aircraft.<ref>Coram 2002, p. 305.</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 1975, [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[John L.

This was split among the European Participation Air Forces (EPAF) as 116 for Belgium, 58 for Denmark, 102 for the Netherlands, and 72 for Norway. Two European production lines, one in the Netherlands at [[Fokker]]'s Schiphol-Oost facility and the other at [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Belge de Constructions A\u00e9ronautiques|SABCA's]] [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Gosselies]] plant in Belgium, would produce 184 and 164 units respectively. Norway's [[Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace|Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk]] and Denmark's [[Terma A/S]] also manufactured parts and subassemblies for EPAF aircraft. European co-production was officially launched on 1 July 1977 at the Fokker factory. Beginning in November 1977, Fokker-produced components were sent to Fort Worth for fuselage assembly, then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of EPAF aircraft at the Belgian plant on 15 February 1978; deliveries to the [[Belgian Air Force]] began in January 1979. The first [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] aircraft was delivered in June 1979.

The stall issue had been raised during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the [[Langley Research Center]] revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated there was a real concern. In response, the area of the horizontal stabilizer were increased by 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.<ref>Chambers, Joseph R.

Strakes act as additional short-span, triangular wings running from the wing root (the juncture with the fuselage) to a point further forward on the fuselage. Blended into the fuselage and along the wing root, the strake generates a high-speed vortex that remains attached to the top of the wing as the angle of attack increases, generating additional lift and allowing greater angles of attack without stalling. Strakes allow a smaller, lower-[[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect-ratio]] wing, which increases roll rates and [[directional stability]] while decreasing weight.

Aircraft with ''negative'' stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable. At supersonic speeds the F-16 gains stability (eventually positive) due to aerodynamic changes.<ref>Hoh and Mitchell 1983, pp. 11ff.</ref><ref>Aronstein and Piccirillo 1996, p. 21.</ref>\n\nTo counter the tendency to depart from controlled flight\u2014and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (four-channel) [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces in such a way as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: \"You don't fly an F-16; it flies you.\"<ref>Greenwood, Cynthia.

The limiters also prevent maneuvers that would exert more than a 9 ''g'' load.<ref>Hoh and Mitchell 1983, p. 5.</ref> Flight testing has revealed that \"assaulting\" multiple limiters at high AOA and low speed can result in an AOA far exceeding the 25\u00b0 limit, colloquially referred to as \"departing\"; this causes a deep stall; a near-freefall at 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 AOA, either upright or inverted. While at a very high AOA, the aircraft's attitude is stable but control surfaces are ineffective; the pitch limiter locks the stabilators at an extreme pitch-up or pitch-down attempting to recover, this can be overridden so the pilot can \"rock\" the nose via pitch control to recover.<ref>Dryden, Joe Bill. {{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/1986/articles/july_86/deep_stalls/index.html |title=Recovering From Deep Stalls And Departures. |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627050146/http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/1986/articles/july_86/deep_stalls/index.html |archivedate=27 June 2009 }} ''Code One'', July 1986.

Its slotted [[planar array]] antenna was designed to be compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low [[Pulse repetition frequency|pulse-repetition frequency]] (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-[[Clutter (radar)|clutter]] environment, and in [[look-down/shoot-down]] employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful [[signal processing]], higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avitop.com/interact/radar.htm|title=The AN/APG-66 Radar.|author=John Raahauge|accessdate=13 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130014311/http://www.avitop.com/interact/radar.htm|archive-date=30 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:F-16 Cockpit part.JPG|thumb|AN-APG-68, as fitted to the nose]]\nThe [[AN/APG-68]], an evolution of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground [[moving target indication]], sea target, and [[track while scan]] (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin [[LANTIRN|Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night]] (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide [[continuous-wave radar]] (CW) target illumination for [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar-homing]] (SARH) missiles like the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing [[VHSIC|Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit]] (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and [[terrain-following radar]] (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.<ref name=\"JAWA\"/>\n\nThe F-16E/F is outfitted with Northrop Grumman's [[AN/APG-80]] [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) radar.<ref>Kopp, Carlo.

However, the Air Force's leadership understood that its budget would not allow it to purchase enough F-15 aircraft to satisfy all of its missions.<ref>Bjorkman, Eileen, Small fast and in your face, Air & Space, Feb/March 2014, pp. 28\u201335</ref> The Advanced Day Fighter concept, renamed ''F-XX'', gained civilian political support under the reform-minded Deputy Secretary of Defense [[David Packard]], who favored the idea of competitive [[prototype|prototyping]]. As a result, in May 1971, the Air Force Prototype Study Group was established, with Boyd a key member, and two of its six proposals would be funded, one being the [[Lightweight Fighter program|Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF). The [[Request for Proposal]]s issued on 6 January 1972 called for a {{convert|20000|lb|kg|sigfig =2|adj =mid}} class air-to-air day fighter with a good turn rate, acceleration, and range, and optimized for combat at speeds of Mach 0.6\u20131.6 and altitudes of {{convert|30000|\u2013|40000|ft|sigfig=2}}. This was the region where USAF studies predicted most future air combat would occur. The anticipated average flyaway cost of a production version was $3&nbsp;million.  This production plan, though, was only notional, as the USAF had no firm plans to procure the winner.<ref>Peacock 1997, pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 7\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Selection of finalists and flyoff====\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|A right-side view of a YF-16 (foreground) and a [[Northrop YF-17]], each armed with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles|alt=Two jet aircraft flying together over mountain range and cloud]]\n\nFive companies responded, and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase. GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth $37.9&nbsp;million and $39.8&nbsp;million to produce the YF-16 and [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]], respectively, with first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974. To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the ''Fighter Mafia'' and other LWF proponents successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix. The \"high/low mix\" would allow the USAF to be able to afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements. The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes' flyoff, defining the relationship of the LWF and the F-15.<ref>Peacock 1997, pp. 10\u201311.</ref><ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe YF-16 was developed by a team of General Dynamics engineers led by [[Robert H.

Its 90-minute [[maiden flight]] was made at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at [[Edwards AFB]], California, on 2 February 1974. Its actual first flight occurred accidentally during a high-speed taxi test on 20 January 1974. While gathering speed, a roll-control oscillation caused a fin of the port-side wingtip-mounted missile and then the starboard [[stabilator]] to scrape the ground, and the aircraft then began to veer off the runway. The test pilot, Phil Oestricher, decided to lift off to avoid a potential crash, safely landing six minutes later. The slight damage was quickly repaired and the official first flight occurred on time. The YF-16's first supersonic flight was accomplished on 5 February 1974, and the second YF-16 prototype first flew on 9 May 1974. This was followed by the first flights of Northrop's YF-17 prototypes on 9 June and 21 August 1974, respectively. During the flyoff, the YF-16s completed 330 [[sorties]] for a total of 417 flight hours;<ref>Richardson 1990, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> the YF-17s flew 288 sorties, covering 345 hours.<ref>Jenkins 2000, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===Air Combat Fighter competition===\nIncreased interest turned the LWF into a serious acquisition program. [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) allies [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] were seeking to replace their [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104G Starfighter]] [[fighter-bomber]]s.<ref>Osborne, Phil, Executive Producer. \"F-16 Fighting Falcon\" (video #9-315842-037444).

The USAF also needed to replace its [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter-bombers. The U.S. Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program that would be a navalized fighter-bomber variant of the LWF. The four NATO allies had formed the \"Multinational Fighter Program Group\" (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S. decision by December 1974; thus, the USAF accelerated testing.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 14\u201315, 19\u201320.</ref><ref name=Richardson_p14/><ref name=Peacock_p12-3/>\n\n[[File:YF-16 VASC.JPG|thumb|YF-16 on display at the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]]]]\nTo reflect this serious intent to procure a new fighter-bomber, the LWF program was rolled into a new Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition in an announcement by [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[James R.

On 11 September 1974, the U.S. Air Force confirmed plans to order the winning ACF design to equip five tactical fighter wings.  Though computer modeling predicted a close contest, the YF-16 proved significantly quicker going from one maneuver to the next, and was the unanimous choice of those pilots that flew both aircraft.<ref>Coram 2002, p. 305.</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 1975, [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[John L.

This was split among the European Participation Air Forces (EPAF) as 116 for Belgium, 58 for Denmark, 102 for the Netherlands, and 72 for Norway. Two European production lines, one in the Netherlands at [[Fokker]]'s Schiphol-Oost facility and the other at [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Belge de Constructions A\u00e9ronautiques|SABCA's]] [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Gosselies]] plant in Belgium, would produce 184 and 164 units respectively. Norway's [[Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace|Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk]] and Denmark's [[Terma A/S]] also manufactured parts and subassemblies for EPAF aircraft. European co-production was officially launched on 1 July 1977 at the Fokker factory. Beginning in November 1977, Fokker-produced components were sent to Fort Worth for fuselage assembly, then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of EPAF aircraft at the Belgian plant on 15 February 1978; deliveries to the [[Belgian Air Force]] began in January 1979. The first [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] aircraft was delivered in June 1979.

The stall issue had been raised during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the [[Langley Research Center]] revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated there was a real concern. In response, the area of the horizontal stabilizer were increased by 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.<ref>Chambers, Joseph R.

Strakes act as additional short-span, triangular wings running from the wing root (the juncture with the fuselage) to a point further forward on the fuselage. Blended into the fuselage and along the wing root, the strake generates a high-speed vortex that remains attached to the top of the wing as the angle of attack increases, generating additional lift and allowing greater angles of attack without stalling. Strakes allow a smaller, lower-[[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect-ratio]] wing, which increases roll rates and [[directional stability]] while decreasing weight.

Aircraft with ''negative'' stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable. At supersonic speeds the F-16 gains stability (eventually positive) due to aerodynamic changes.<ref>Hoh and Mitchell 1983, pp. 11ff.</ref><ref>Aronstein and Piccirillo 1996, p. 21.</ref>\n\nTo counter the tendency to depart from controlled flight\u2014and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (four-channel) [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces in such a way as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: \"You don't fly an F-16; it flies you.\"<ref>Greenwood, Cynthia.

The limiters also prevent maneuvers that would exert more than a 9 ''g'' load.<ref>Hoh and Mitchell 1983, p. 5.</ref> Flight testing has revealed that \"assaulting\" multiple limiters at high AOA and low speed can result in an AOA far exceeding the 25\u00b0 limit, colloquially referred to as \"departing\"; this causes a deep stall; a near-freefall at 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 AOA, either upright or inverted. While at a very high AOA, the aircraft's attitude is stable but control surfaces are ineffective; the pitch limiter locks the stabilators at an extreme pitch-up or pitch-down attempting to recover, this can be overridden so the pilot can \"rock\" the nose via pitch control to recover.<ref>Dryden, Joe Bill. {{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/1986/articles/july_86/deep_stalls/index.html |title=Recovering From Deep Stalls And Departures. |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627050146/http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/1986/articles/july_86/deep_stalls/index.html |archivedate=27 June 2009 }} ''Code One'', July 1986.

Its slotted [[planar array]] antenna was designed to be compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low [[Pulse repetition frequency|pulse-repetition frequency]] (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-[[Clutter (radar)|clutter]] environment, and in [[look-down/shoot-down]] employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful [[signal processing]], higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avitop.com/interact/radar.htm|title=The AN/APG-66 Radar.|author=John Raahauge|accessdate=13 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130014311/http://www.avitop.com/interact/radar.htm|archive-date=30 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:F-16 Cockpit part.JPG|thumb|AN-APG-68, as fitted to the nose]]\nThe [[AN/APG-68]], an evolution of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground [[moving target indication]], sea target, and [[track while scan]] (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin [[LANTIRN|Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night]] (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide [[continuous-wave radar]] (CW) target illumination for [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar-homing]] (SARH) missiles like the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing [[VHSIC|Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit]] (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and [[terrain-following radar]] (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.<ref name=\"JAWA\"/>\n\nThe F-16E/F is outfitted with Northrop Grumman's [[AN/APG-80]] [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) radar.<ref>Kopp, Carlo.

It is the [[English language|English]] version of the [[French language|French]] name [[Jos\u00e9phine]]. In Greece the female name Josephine is (Io\u0331si\u0331f\u00edna) and is used mainly on the island of Crete in Greece. The feminine form of the name [[Joseph (name)|Joseph]], which is taken from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name Yosef, meaning \"([[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]) shall grow.\"\n\n==Variations==\nOriginally a diminutive form of the French name ''Jos\u00e9phe'', Jos\u00e9phine became the standard form in the 19th century, replacing ''Jos\u00e9phe'', which eventually became a very rare name. In 2017, Josephine was the 107th most popular girls' baby name in the USA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi|title=Popular Baby Names|last=OACT|website=www.ssa.gov|access-date=2018-05-28}}</ref> Diminutive forms of this name include Fifi, Jo, [[Josie (disambiguation)|Josie]], Joetta and Jojo. Other language variants include the Irish version Seosaimh\u00edn, the Spanish version [[Josefina (disambiguation)|Josefina]] or [[Josephina (disambiguation)|Josephina]], and the Greek version Iosiphina ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0399\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1). Alternate spellings include Yosefina and Gosefine. The Swedish version is Josefine.\n\nThe name started gaining popularity after 1800 due to the high profile of [[Josephine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], a French noblewoman who became [[Napoleon]]'s mistress and later his wife and [[First French Empire|Empress of the French]].\n\n== Translations ==\n* \u062c\u0648\u0632\u0641\u064a\u0646 '''(Arabic)'''\n* *

In Greece the female name Josephine is (Io\u0331si\u0331f\u00edna) and is used mainly on the island of Crete in Greece. The feminine form of the name [[Joseph (name)|Joseph]], which is taken from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name Yosef, meaning \"([[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]) shall grow.\"\n\n==Variations==\nOriginally a diminutive form of the French name ''Jos\u00e9phe'', Jos\u00e9phine became the standard form in the 19th century, replacing ''Jos\u00e9phe'', which eventually became a very rare name. In 2017, Josephine was the 107th most popular girls' baby name in the USA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi|title=Popular Baby Names|last=OACT|website=www.ssa.gov|access-date=2018-05-28}}</ref> Diminutive forms of this name include Fifi, Jo, [[Josie (disambiguation)|Josie]], Joetta and Jojo. Other language variants include the Irish version Seosaimh\u00edn, the Spanish version [[Josefina (disambiguation)|Josefina]] or [[Josephina (disambiguation)|Josephina]], and the Greek version Iosiphina ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0399\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1). Alternate spellings include Yosefina and Gosefine. The Swedish version is Josefine.\n\nThe name started gaining popularity after 1800 due to the high profile of [[Josephine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], a French noblewoman who became

It achieved wide use in both [[Lunatic asylum|asylums]] and the homes of those socially refined enough to avoid asylums. Upper- and middle-class women, well-represented in the latter category, were particularly susceptible to chloral hydrate [[addiction]].

In 1875, [[Claude Bernard]] tried to determine if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a metabolic conversion to [[chloroform]]. This was not only the first attempt to determine whether different drugs were converted to the same [[metabolite]] in the body but also the first to measure the concentration of a particular pharmaceutical in the blood.

However, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more [[lipophilic]] molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]]. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer\u2013Overton correlation than chloral had.

In 1875, [[Claude Bernard]] tried to determine if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a metabolic conversion to [[chloroform]]. This was not only the first attempt to determine whether different drugs were converted to the same [[metabolite]] in the body but also the first to measure the concentration of a particular pharmaceutical in the blood. The results were inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alston|first=Theodore A.|date=July 2016|title=Noteworthy Chemistry of Chloroform|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=3|pages=85\u201388|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2016.04.008|pmid=27480474|issn=2352-4529}}</ref> In 1899 and 1901 [[Hans Horst Meyer]] and [[Ernest Overton]] respectively made the major discovery that the [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|general anaesthetic action]] of a drug was strongly correlated to its [[lipid]] [[solubility]]. However, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more [[lipophilic]] molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]]. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer\u2013Overton correlation than chloral had. Prior to this, it had not been demonstrated that general anesthetics could undergo chemical changes to exert their action in the body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasowski|first=Matthew D.|title=Contradicting a Unitary Theory of General Anesthetic Action: a History of Three Compounds from 1901 to 2001|journal=Bulletin of Anesthesia History|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1\u201324|doi=10.1016/s1522-8649(03)50031-2|pmid=17494361|pmc=2701367|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nFinally, chloral hydrate was also the first hypnotic to be used [[intravenous injection|intravenously]] as a general anesthetic. In 1871, [[Pierre-Cyprien Or\u00e9]] began experiments on animals, followed by humans. While a state of general anesthesia could be achieved, the technique never caught on because its administration was more complex and less safe than the oral administration of chloral hydrate, and less safe for intravenous use than later general anesthetics were found to be.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Matthew|last2=Jagdish|first2=S.|date=January 2016|title=A History of Intravenous Anesthesia in War (1656\u20131988)|url=http://www.anesthesiahistoryjournal.org/article/S2352-4529(15)00084-5/fulltext|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13\u201321|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2015.10.007|pmid=26898141|issn=2352-4529}}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\nChloral hydrate was used as one of the earliest synthetic drugs to treat [[insomnia]] until 1912, when [[phenobarbital]] replaced it and made its use unnecessary.\n\nIn 1897, [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Dracula]]'', one of its characters, Doctor [[John Seward]], recorded his use and his [[molecular formula]] in his [[phonograph]]ic [[diary]]:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been.
