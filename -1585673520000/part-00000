Approximately 35% of patients with Paget's have symptoms related to the disease when they are first diagnosed.<ref name=\"Ralston_PagetsDzBone\" /> Overall, the most common symptom is [[bone pain]].<ref name=\"Ralston_PagetsDzBone\" /> When symptoms do occur, they may be confused with those of arthritis or other disorders, and so diagnosis may be delayed.\n\nPaget's may first be noticed as an increasing deformity of a person's bones.\n\nPaget's disease affecting the skull may cause frontal bossing, increased hat size, and headaches. Often patients may develop [[Deafness|loss of hearing]] in one or both ears<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone /> due to auditory foramen narrowing and resultant compression of the nerves in the inner ear. Rarely, skull involvement may lead to compression of the nerves that supply the [[human eye|eye]], leading to [[Visual loss|vision loss]].<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone />\n\n===Associated conditions===\nPaget's disease is a frequent component of [[multisystem proteinopathy]].\nAdvanced Paget's disease may lead to other medical conditions, including:\n*[[Osteoarthritis]] may result from changes in bone shape that alter normal skeletal mechanics. For example, bowing of a femur affected by Paget's may distort overall leg alignment, subjecting the knee to abnormal mechanical forces and accelerating degenerative wear. \n*[[Heart failure]] is a rare, reported consequence of severe Paget's disease (i.e. more than 40% skeletal involvement). The abnormal bone formation is associated with recruitment of abnormal blood vessels, forcing the cardiovascular system to work harder (pump more blood) to ensure adequate circulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chakravorty |first1=N.K. |title=Some Unusual Features of Paget's Disease of Bone |journal=Gerontology |date=1978 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=459\u2013472 |doi=10.1159/000212286 |pmid=689380 }}</ref> \n*[[Kidney stone]]s are somewhat more common in patients with Paget's disease.\n*[[Nervous system]] problems may occur in Paget's disease, resulting from increased pressure on the brain, [[spinal cord]], or nerves, and reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord.\n*When Paget's disease affects the facial bones, the [[teeth]] may become loose.  Disturbance in chewing may occur. Chronic dental problems may lead to [[Osteomyelitis|infection of the jaw bone]].\n*[[Angioid streaks]] may develop, possibly as a result of calcification of collagen or other pathological deposition.\n*[[Vulvar tumors|Vulvar]] Paget's disease ulceration can occur in [[vulva|female reproductive]] organs.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Roberta |last1=Vanni |first2=Giuseppina |last2=Parodo |year=2007 |title=Vulva and Vagina tumors: an overview |url=http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Tumors/VulVaginaCarcID5274.html |website=Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology }}</ref>\n\nPaget's disease is ''not'' associated with [[osteoporosis]].

These localized areas of pathological destruction of bone tissue (osteolysis) are seen radiologically as an advancing lytic wedge in long bones or the skull.  When this occurs in the skull, it is called [[osteoporosis circumscripta]].  The osteolysis is followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation induced by the bone forming cells, called osteoblasts, that are recruited to the area. This is associated with accelerated deposition of [[lamellar bone]] in a disorganized fashion.  This intense cellular activity produces a chaotic picture of [[trabecular bone]] (\"mosaic\" pattern), rather than the normal linear lamellar pattern.  The resorbed bone is replaced and the marrow spaces are filled by an excess of fibrous connective tissue with a marked increase in blood vessels, causing the bone to become [[hypervascular]].  The bone [[hypercellularity]] may then diminish, leaving a dense \"pagetic bone,\" also known as burned-out Paget's disease. A later phase of the disease is characterized by the replacement of normal bone marrow with highly vascular fibrous tissue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Marcia|publisher=F.A.

Man of 80 years age.]]\nPaget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests:\n*Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on [[X-ray]]s. A [[skeletal survey]] is therefore indicated.\n*An elevated level of [[alkaline phosphatase]] in the blood in combination with normal [[calcium]], [[phosphate]], and [[aminotransferase]] levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease.\n*Markers of bone turnover in urine ''eg''. [[Pyridinoline]]\n*Elevated levels of serum and urinary [[hydroxyproline]] are also found.\n*[[Bone scan]]s are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\n{{Bone pathology}}\n\n==Treatment==\nAlthough initially diagnosed by a [[primary care physician]], [[endocrinologist]]s ([[internal medicine]] physicians who specialize in hormonal and metabolic disorders), [[rheumatologist]]s (internal medicine physicians who specialize in joint and muscle disorders), [[orthopedic surgeon]]s, [[neurosurgeon]]s, [[neurologist]]s, [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon]]s, and [[otolaryngologist]]s are generally knowledgeable about treating Paget's disease, and may be called upon to evaluate specialized symptoms. It can sometimes difficult to predict whether a person with Paget's disease, who otherwise has no signs or symptoms of the disorder, will develop symptoms or complications (such as a bone fracture) in the future.\n\n===Medication===\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve bone pain and prevent the progression of the disease.  These medications are usually recommended for people with Paget's disease who:\n*have bone pain, headache, back pain, or a nerve-related symptom (such as \"shooting\" pains in the leg) that is directly associated with the disease;\n*have elevated levels of serum [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP) in their blood;\n*display evidence that a bone fracture will occur;\n*require pretreatment therapy for affected bones that require surgery;\n*have active symptoms in the skull, long bones, or vertebrae (spine);\n*have the disease in bones located next to major joints, placing them at risk of developing osteoarthritis;\n*develop hypercalcemia that occurs when a person, with several bones affected by Paget's disease and a high serum alkaline phosphatase level, is immobilized.\n\n====Bisphosphonates====\nFive [[bisphosphonate]]s are currently available.

However, these studies were only inclusive of osteoporosis.\n\n===Surgery===\nMedical therapy prior to surgery helps to decrease bleeding and other complications. Patients who are having surgery should discuss treatment with their physician. There are generally three major complications of Paget's disease for which surgery may be recommended.\n\n*Fractures \u2014 Surgery may allow fractures to heal in a better position.\n*Severe degenerative arthritis \u2014 If disability is severe and medication and physical therapy are no longer helpful, joint replacement of the hips and knees may be considered.\n*Bone deformity \u2014 Cutting and realignment of pagetic bone (osteotomy) may help painful [[weight bearing]] joints, especially the knees.\n\nComplications resulting from enlargement of the skull or spine may injure the nervous system. However, most neurologic symptoms, even those that are moderately severe, can be treated with medication and do not require neurosurgery.\n\n===Diet and exercise===\nIn general, patients with Paget's disease should receive 1000\u20131500&nbsp;mg of [[calcium]], adequate [[sunlight|sunshine]], and at least 400 units of [[vitamin D]] daily. This is especially important in patients being treated with bisphosphonates; however, taking oral bisphosphonates should be separated from taking calcium by at least two hours, because the calcium can inhibit the absorption of the bisphosphonate. Patients with a history of [[Nephrolithiasis|kidney stones]] should discuss calcium and vitamin D intake with their physicians.\n\n[[Exercise]] is very important in maintaining skeletal health, avoiding [[weight gain]], and maintaining joint mobility. Since undue stress on affected bones should be avoided, people with Paget's disease of bone should discuss any exercise program with their physicians or physical therapists before beginning.\n\n==Prognosis ==\nThe disease is progressive and slowly worsens with time, although people may remain minimally symptomatic. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms, but there is no cure. Any bone or bones can be affected, but Paget's disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, femur, and lower legs.\n\n[[Osteosarcoma|Osteogenic sarcoma]], a form of bone [[cancer]], is a rare complication of Paget's disease occurring in less than one percent of those affected. The development of osteosarcoma may be suggested by the sudden onset or worsening pain.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nPagets disease of bone is the second most common metabolic bone disorder, after [[osteoporosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alonso |first1=N. |last2=Calero-Paniagua |first2=I. |last3=del Pino-Montes |first3=J. |title=Clinical and Genetic Advances in Paget's Disease of Bone: a Review |journal=Clinical Reviews in Bone and Mineral Metabolism |date=19 December 2016 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201348 |doi=10.1007/s12018-016-9226-0 |pmid=28255281 |pmc=5309316 }}</ref> The overall prevalence and severity of Paget's disease are decreasing; the cause for these changes is unclear.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets /> Paget's disease is rare in people less than 55 years of age,<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone /> and the prevalence increases with age.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets /> Evidence from studies of autopsy results have demonstrated Paget's disease in about 3 percent of people older than 40 years of age.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets /> Paget's disease is more common in males than females.<ref name=Kumar /> Rates of Paget's disease are about 50 percent higher in men than in women.\n\nAbout 15 percent of people with Paget's disease also have a family member with the disease.<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone /> In cases where the disease is familial, it is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, although not all people that inherit the affected version of the genes will express the disease ([[incomplete penetrance]]).<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone />\n\nThe incidence of Paget's disease varies considerably with geographic location.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets>{{cite book|authors=Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo J|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine:Chapter 355.

In a paper published in 1877, Paget told of five patients with \"a rare disease of bones\" which presented with slowly progressive bone deformities in the 4th and 5th decades of age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paget|first=James|date=1887|title=On a form of chronic inflammation of bone (osteitis deformans)|url=|journal=Medico-cirurgical Transactions of London|volume=60|pages=37\u201363|via=}}</ref> Strikingly, the first patient was described to have many of the classic complications of the disease, including [[arthritis]] related to abnormal bone mechanics, cranial nerve palsies associated with an enlarging skull, and malignant transformation of a tumor of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] which ultimately proved fatal. Paget's post-mortem autopsy evaluation showed  \"bones of the vault of this skull were in every part increased to about four times the normal thickness,\" and microscopic evaluation showed evidence of both bone erosion and abnormal remodeling. Although he incorrectly attributed the findings to a process of chronic inflammation, having ruled out tumor and hypertrophy as alternative etiologies, these prescient observations of a mixed destructive/regenerative process correspond to the modern understanding of the disease.\n\n{{Quote|text=Holding, then, the disease to be an inflammation of bones, I would suggest that, for brief reference, and for the present, it may be called, after its most striking character, Osteitis deformans.

These localized areas of pathological destruction of bone tissue (osteolysis) are seen radiologically as an advancing lytic wedge in long bones or the skull.  When this occurs in the skull, it is called [[osteoporosis circumscripta]].  The osteolysis is followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation induced by the bone forming cells, called osteoblasts, that are recruited to the area. This is associated with accelerated deposition of [[lamellar bone]] in a disorganized fashion.  This intense cellular activity produces a chaotic picture of [[trabecular bone]] (\"mosaic\" pattern), rather than the normal linear lamellar pattern.  The resorbed bone is replaced and the marrow spaces are filled by an excess of fibrous connective tissue with a marked increase in blood vessels, causing the bone to become [[hypervascular]].  The bone [[hypercellularity]] may then diminish, leaving a dense \"pagetic bone,\" also known as burned-out Paget's disease. A later phase of the disease is characterized by the replacement of normal bone marrow with highly vascular fibrous tissue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Marcia|publisher=F.A.

Some evidence suggests that a [[Paramyxoviridae|paramyxovirus]] infection is the underlying cause of Paget's disease,<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone /> which may support the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis.  However, no infectious virus has yet been isolated as a causative agent, and other evidence suggests an intrinsic hyperresponsive reaction to [[vitamin D]] and [[RANK ligand]] is the cause.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Further research is therefore necessary.<ref>Basic Pathology, Kumar Abbas Fausto Mitchell, Saunders Elsevier{{page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:PagetDiseaseIvoryVertL2.png|thumb|An ivory vertebra due to probable Paget disease]]The first clinical manifestation of Paget's disease is usually an elevated [[alkaline phosphatase]] in the blood.<ref name=\"Ralston_PagetsDzBone\" /> [[File:Paget's disease R coxal.jpg|thumb|Paget's disease of right innominate bone. Man of 80 years age.]]\nPaget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests:\n*Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on [[X-ray]]s. A [[skeletal survey]] is therefore indicated.\n*An elevated level of [[alkaline phosphatase]] in the blood in combination with normal [[calcium]], [[phosphate]], and [[aminotransferase]] levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease.\n*Markers of bone turnover in urine ''eg''. [[Pyridinoline]]\n*Elevated levels of serum and urinary [[hydroxyproline]] are also found.\n*[[Bone scan]]s are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\n{{Bone pathology}}\n\n==Treatment==\nAlthough initially diagnosed by a [[primary care physician]], [[endocrinologist]]s ([[internal medicine]] physicians who specialize in hormonal and metabolic disorders), [[rheumatologist]]s (internal medicine physicians who specialize in joint and muscle disorders), [[orthopedic surgeon]]s, [[neurosurgeon]]s, [[neurologist]]s, [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon]]s, and [[otolaryngologist]]s are generally knowledgeable about treating Paget's disease, and may be called upon to evaluate specialized symptoms. It can sometimes difficult to predict whether a person with Paget's disease, who otherwise has no signs or symptoms of the disorder, will develop symptoms or complications (such as a bone fracture) in the future.\n\n===Medication===\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve bone pain and prevent the progression of the disease.  These medications are usually recommended for people with Paget's disease who:\n*have bone pain, headache, back pain, or a nerve-related symptom (such as \"shooting\" pains in the leg) that is directly associated with the disease;\n*have elevated levels of serum [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP) in their blood;\n*display evidence that a bone fracture will occur;\n*require pretreatment therapy for affected bones that require surgery;\n*have active symptoms in the skull, long bones, or vertebrae (spine);\n*have the disease in bones located next to major joints, placing them at risk of developing osteoarthritis;\n*develop hypercalcemia that occurs when a person, with several bones affected by Paget's disease and a high serum alkaline phosphatase level, is immobilized.\n\n====Bisphosphonates====\nFive [[bisphosphonate]]s are currently available. In general, the most commonly prescribed are [[risedronic acid]], [[alendronic acid]], and [[pamidronic acid]]. [[Etidronic acid]] and other bisphosphonates may be appropriate therapies for selected patients but are less commonly used. In one study it was reported that people experienced side effects when taking bisphosphonates for six months, however the quality of evidence was low.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Corral-Gudino |first1=Luis |last2=Tan |first2=Adrian JH |last3=del Pino-Montes |first3=Javier |last4=Ralston |first4=Stuart H |title=Bisphosphonates for Paget's disease of bone in adults |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=12 |pages=CD004956 |date=1 December 2017 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004956.pub3 |pmid=29192423 |pmc=6486234 }}</ref> None of these drugs should be used by people with severe kidney disease.\n\n*[[Etidronate disodium]] The approved regimen is once daily for six months; a higher dose is more commonly used. No food, beverage, or medications should be consumed for two hours before and after taking. The course should not exceed six months, but repeat courses can be given after rest periods, preferably of three to six months duration.\n*[[Pamidronate disodium]] in intravenous form: the approved regimen uses an infusion over four hours on each of three consecutive days, but a more commonly used regimen is over two to four hours for two or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days.\n*[[Alendronate sodium]] is given as tablets once daily for six months; patients should wait at least 30 minutes after taking before eating any food, drinking anything other than tap water, taking any medication, or lying down (patient may sit).\n*[[Tiludronate disodium]] are taken once daily for three months; they may be taken any time of day, as long as there is a period of two hours before and after resuming food, beverages, and medications.\n*[[Risedronate sodium]] tablet taken once daily for 2 months is the prescribed regimen; patients should wait at least 30 minutes after taking before eating any food, drinking anything other than tap water, taking any medication, or lying down (patient may sit).\n*[[Zoledronic acid]] is given as an intravenous infusion; a single dose is effective for two years.

As a solution for injection or infusion, calcitonin should be administered for no more than 4 weeks to prevent acute bone loss resulting from sudden immobilization, and normally for no more than 3 months to treat Paget's disease, the EMA said. The agency did not specify a time frame for the short-term use of calcitonin for treating hypercalcemia caused by cancer. The EMA based its recommendations on a review of the benefits and risks of calcitonin-containing medicines. Conducted by the agency's [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP), the review encompassed available data from the companies that market these drugs, postmarketing safety data, randomized controlled studies, 2 studies of unlicensed oral calcitonin drugs, and experimental cancer studies, among other sources.\n\nIn 2014, the FDA noted the risk imbalances in the prescribing information for [[Miacalcin]] but declined to label this product with a [[boxed warning]] as a causal association was not identified.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |title=Questions and Answers: Changes to the Indicated Population for Miacalcin (calcitonin-salmon) |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-changes-indicated-population-miacalcin-calcitonin-salmon |website=FDA |language=en |date=3 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA more recent meta-analysis determined that a causal link between [[calcitonin]] and cancer is both unlikely and antithetical to known biology, although a weak association was not definitively excluded.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wells |first1=G. |last2=Chernoff |first2=J. |last3=Gilligan |first3=J.

However, these studies were only inclusive of osteoporosis.\n\n===Surgery===\nMedical therapy prior to surgery helps to decrease bleeding and other complications. Patients who are having surgery should discuss treatment with their physician. There are generally three major complications of Paget's disease for which surgery may be recommended.\n\n*Fractures \u2014 Surgery may allow fractures to heal in a better position.\n*Severe degenerative arthritis \u2014 If disability is severe and medication and physical therapy are no longer helpful, joint replacement of the hips and knees may be considered.\n*Bone deformity \u2014 Cutting and realignment of pagetic bone (osteotomy) may help painful [[weight bearing]] joints, especially the knees.\n\nComplications resulting from enlargement of the skull or spine may injure the nervous system. However, most neurologic symptoms, even those that are moderately severe, can be treated with medication and do not require neurosurgery.\n\n===Diet and exercise===\nIn general, patients with Paget's disease should receive 1000\u20131500&nbsp;mg of [[calcium]], adequate [[sunlight|sunshine]], and at least 400 units of [[vitamin D]] daily. This is especially important in patients being treated with bisphosphonates; however, taking oral bisphosphonates should be separated from taking calcium by at least two hours, because the calcium can inhibit the absorption of the bisphosphonate. Patients with a history of [[Nephrolithiasis|kidney stones]] should discuss calcium and vitamin D intake with their physicians.\n\n[[Exercise]] is very important in maintaining skeletal health, avoiding [[weight gain]], and maintaining joint mobility. Since undue stress on affected bones should be avoided, people with Paget's disease of bone should discuss any exercise program with their physicians or physical therapists before beginning.\n\n==Prognosis ==\nThe disease is progressive and slowly worsens with time, although people may remain minimally symptomatic. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms, but there is no cure. Any bone or bones can be affected, but Paget's disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, femur, and lower legs.\n\n[[Osteosarcoma|Osteogenic sarcoma]], a form of bone [[cancer]], is a rare complication of Paget's disease occurring in less than one percent of those affected. The development of osteosarcoma may be suggested by the sudden onset or worsening pain.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nPagets disease of bone is the second most common metabolic bone disorder, after [[osteoporosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alonso |first1=N. |last2=Calero-Paniagua |first2=I. |last3=del Pino-Montes |first3=J. |title=Clinical and Genetic Advances in Paget's Disease of Bone: a Review |journal=Clinical Reviews in Bone and Mineral Metabolism |date=19 December 2016 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201348 |doi=10.1007/s12018-016-9226-0 |pmid=28255281 |pmc=5309316 }}</ref> The overall prevalence and severity of Paget's disease are decreasing; the cause for these changes is unclear.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets /> Paget's disease is rare in people less than 55 years of age,<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone /> and the prevalence increases with age.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets /> Evidence from studies of autopsy results have demonstrated Paget's disease in about 3 percent of people older than 40 years of age.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets /> Paget's disease is more common in males than females.<ref name=Kumar /> Rates of Paget's disease are about 50 percent higher in men than in women.\n\nAbout 15 percent of people with Paget's disease also have a family member with the disease.<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone /> In cases where the disease is familial, it is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, although not all people that inherit the affected version of the genes will express the disease ([[incomplete penetrance]]).<ref name=Ralston_PagetsDzBone />\n\nThe incidence of Paget's disease varies considerably with geographic location.<ref name=HarrisonsPagets>{{cite book|authors=Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo J|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine:Chapter 355.

Paget's post-mortem autopsy evaluation showed  \"bones of the vault of this skull were in every part increased to about four times the normal thickness,\" and microscopic evaluation showed evidence of both bone erosion and abnormal remodeling. Although he incorrectly attributed the findings to a process of chronic inflammation, having ruled out tumor and hypertrophy as alternative etiologies, these prescient observations of a mixed destructive/regenerative process correspond to the modern understanding of the disease.\n\n{{Quote|text=Holding, then, the disease to be an inflammation of bones, I would suggest that, for brief reference, and for the present, it may be called, after its most striking character, Osteitis deformans.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with founding year in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=UC Santa Cruz News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=special-reports |url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists - News VietNamNet |publisher=English.vietnamnet.vn |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\n* [[Marconi Prize]] (1975)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1110|title=2011 Marconi Society Symposium Comes to UC San Diego|website=ucsd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/nri-scientist-aj-paulraj-wins-tech-nobel-2014-marconi-prize/articleshow/29232251.cms|title=NRI scientist AJ Paulraj wins tech 'Nobel'- 2014 Marconi Prize|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=23 January 2014|last1=Rajghatta|first1=Chidanand}}</ref><ref name=turing/>\n\n====Computer science====\n* [[Turing Award]] (1966)<ref name=turing/><ref name=turing2007/><ref name=turing2014/>\n* [[Nevanlinna Prize|IMU Abacus Medal]] (1982)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/imu-abacus-medal/|author=Katie Steckles|date=23 May 2019|title=IMU Abacus Medal|website=spektrum.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/who-was-nevanlinna-and-what-is-his-prize/|author=John Cook|date=22 September 2013|title=Who was Nevanlinna and what is his prize?|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yale.edu/2010/08/19/yale-computer-scientist-wins-prestigious-nevanlinna-prize|date=19 August 2010|title=Yale Computer Scientist Wins Prestigious Nevanlinna Prize|website=yale.edu}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n* 1: The IMU Abacus Medal is awarded once every 4 years to a mathematician/computer scientist under '''40''' years of age on the occasion of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM).\n}}</small>\n\n====Economics====\n* [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (1969)\n* [[John Bates Clark Medal]] (1947)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/974259/stanfords-dave-donaldson-2017-clark-medal-winner-explains-the-flaws-in-anti-free-trade-arguments/|title=The Stanford economist who won the latest 'Baby Nobel' explains the biggest flaws in anti-free trade arguments|author=Dan Kopf|website=qz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/Baby-Nobel-for-Delhi-born-US-economist-Raj-Chetty/articleshow/19567003.cms|title='Baby Nobel' for Delhi-born US economist Raj Chetty|author=Chidanand Rajghatta|website=indiatimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/04/22/handicapping-economics-baby-nobel-the-clark-medal/|title=Handicapping Economics' 'Baby Nobel,' the Clark Medal|author=Justin Lahart|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=23 April 2010}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n* 1: The Clark Medal is awarded annually (biennially before 2009) to an economist under '''40''' years of age who work in the US at the time of the award, regardless of his/her nationality.

When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as [[UFO]]s, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] might be travelers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.\n\n=== Time machine ===\nTitor described his time machine on several occasions.

This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense [[World War III]].\n\nTitor refers to the exchange as \"N Day\". [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by \"border clashes and overpopulation\".<ref>John Titor, 2/8/01 9:40</ref> He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes a hypothetical World War III.\n\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\n\nTitor claimed that the \"Everett\u2013Wheeler model of quantum physics\", better known as the [[many-worlds interpretation]], was correct. According to Titor, this caused a new timestream to form because of his time travel.  This gives his predictions the ability to stand up to scrutiny when they fail to pass, since believers can say that the events were averted by Titor's postings.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\n== Criticism and discussion ==\n''[[The Neew Republic]]'' called Titor the most famous of several internet forum posters who claimed to be time travelers.<ref name=tnr/>\n\nAn Italian television program, ''Voyager \u2013 Ai confini della conoscenza'', aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008.

This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense [[World War III]].\n\nTitor refers to the exchange as \"N Day\". [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by \"border clashes and overpopulation\".<ref>John Titor, 2/8/01 9:40</ref> He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes a hypothetical World War III.\n\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\n\nTitor claimed that the \"Everett\u2013Wheeler model of quantum physics\", better known as the [[many-worlds interpretation]], was correct. According to Titor, this caused a new timestream to form because of his time travel.  This gives his predictions the ability to stand up to scrutiny when they fail to pass, since believers can say that the events were averted by Titor's postings.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\n== Criticism and discussion ==\n''[[The New Republic]]'' called Titor the most famous of several internet forum posters who claimed to be time travelers.<ref name=tnr/>\n\nAn Italian television program, ''Voyager \u2013 Ai confini della conoscenza'', aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008.

He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in [[Kissimmee, Florida]].

The phenomenon is a result of the game's extremely high viewership and wide demographics: Super Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most-watched television broadcasts]], with [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] having estimated that [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 was seen by at least 114.4 million viewers in the United States, surpassing [[Super Bowl XLVIII|the previous year's Super Bowl]] as the highest-rated television broadcast in U.S. history. As such, advertisers have typically used commercials during the Super Bowl as a means of building awareness for their products and services among this wide audience, while also trying to generate [[Marketing buzz|buzz]] around the ads themselves so they may receive additional exposure, such as becoming a [[viral video]]. Some commercials airing during, or proposed to air during the game, have attracted controversy due to the nature of their content.\n\nSuper Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon of their own alongside the game itself; many viewers only watch the game to see the commercials,<ref name=\"forbes-4m\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/ | title=Yes, A Super Bowl Ad Really Is Worth $4 Million | work=[[Forbes.com]] | date=January 29, 2014 | access-date=September 15, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002055356/https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/ | archive-date=October 2, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> national surveys (such as the ''[[USA Today]]'' [[Super Bowl Ad Meter]]) judge which advertisement carried the best viewer response, and [[CBS]] has aired yearly specials since 2000 chronicling notable commercials from the game. Super Bowl advertisements have become iconic and well known because of their [[Cinematography|cinematographic]] quality, unpredictability, surreal humor, and use of special effects. The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads. Several major brands, including [[Budweiser]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Doritos]], [[GoDaddy]], [[Master Lock]], and [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] have been well known for making repeated appearances during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe prominence of airing a commercial during the Super Bowl has carried an increasingly high price. The average cost of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl has ranged from $37,500 at [[Super Bowl I]] to around $2.2 million at [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in 2000. By [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015, the cost had doubled to around $4.5 million,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superbowl-ads.com/cost-of-super-bowl-advertising-breakdown-by-year/|title=Cost of Super Bowl Advertising Breakdown by Year|work=SuperBowl-Ads.com|date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> and by Super Bowl LIV in 2020, the cost had reached $5.6 million for a 30-second slot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/05/03/nfl-fox-changing-commercial-strategy-for-super-bowl-liv/|title=NFL, Fox Changing up the Commercials for Super Bowl LIV|work=New York Post|date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSuper Bowl commercials are largely limited to the United States' broadcast of the game. Complaints about the inability to view the ads are prevalent in Canada, where [[Simsub|federal \"simsub\" regulations]] require pay television providers to replace feeds of programs from U.S. broadcast stations with domestic feeds if they are being broadcast at the same time as a Canadian broadcast station. In 2016, the [[CRTC]], Canada's telecom regulator, enacted a policy from 2017 to 2019 to forbid the use of simsub during the Super Bowl, citing viewer complaints and a belief that these ads were an \"integral part\" of the game; [[Super Bowl LI]] was the first game to fall under this policy. The NFL's Canadian rightsholder [[Bell Media]] challenged the policy at the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|federal appeals court]], arguing that it violated the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]] by singling out a specific program for regulation and devalued its broadcast rights to the game. While the appeals court sided with the CRTC, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] overturned the ruling in December 2019 as a violation of the Broadcasting Act.<ref name=\"Financial Post\">{{Cite web|url=https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/nfl-broadcaster-notch-canadian-court-victory-on-super-bowl-ads|title=Super Bowl ad victory for Bell, NFL in Canada |work=Financial Post|date=2019-12-19|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n[[File:Super Bowl XLVII Kick Off.jpg|thumb|The opening [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]] of [[Super Bowl XLVII]]]]\nSuper Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most watched television broadcasts]]; [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 set an all-time record for viewership at the game, with an average of 114.4 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]], exceeding a record set the previous year at [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] (112.2 million).

In 1965, the company had first run a television commercial demonstrating the strength of its [[Lock (security device)|padlocks]], by having a person shoot it with a [[handgun]] in a failed attempt to breach it. The campaign was pulled after the company's advertising director, Edson F. Allen, realized the stunt could be imitated by those who were unsure of the commercial's authenticity. By the 1970s, Allen discussed the possibility of reviving the concept, but using a [[rifle]] rather than a handgun to make it harder to imitate. The resulting commercial would premiere in 1974 during [[Super Bowl VIII]]; despite concerns by the staff of Master Lock and their agency, [[Campbell Mithun]], over the content of the ad, the commercial was well received by the general public.<ref name=milwaukee-lock/><ref name=usatoday-masterlock/><ref name=wsj-newbieadvertisers>{{Cite web|last1=Perlberg|first1=Steven|title=Super Bowl Gets a Spike in Newbie Advertisers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156|access-date=March 25, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324224726/http://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156|archive-date=March 24, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cramer-Krasselt]] took over as Master Lock's agency later in the year, the company decided to make the gun ads a tradition, and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one featuring skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an \"event\" that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve Master Lock's market share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year.

Due to the timely nature of the ad's details, it was filmed over the weeks immediately prior to the Super Bowl, and required P&G's agency to construct a replica of Fox's actual on-field set for the game, and use visual effects to correctly reflect the look of the stadium and the teams participating in the game.

It was also pointed out that King had, ironically, criticized the advertising industry during the same sermon as being \"gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion\", explaining that \"in order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you're just buying that stuff.\" William B.

This rule is intended to protect the investments of Canadian broadcasters in exclusive domestic broadcast rights, and also protect Canadian advertisers who had purchased their own advertising time on the Canadian network.

Complaints about the inability to view the ads are prevalent in Canada, where [[Simsub|federal \"simsub\" regulations]] require pay television providers to replace feeds of programs from U.S. broadcast stations with domestic feeds if they are being broadcast at the same time as a Canadian broadcast station. In 2016, the [[CRTC]], Canada's telecom regulator, enacted a policy from 2017 to 2019 to forbid the use of simsub during the Super Bowl, citing viewer complaints and a belief that these ads were an \"integral part\" of the game; [[Super Bowl LI]] was the first game to fall under this policy. The NFL's Canadian rightsholder [[Bell Media]] challenged the policy at the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|federal appeals court]], arguing that it violated the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]] by singling out a specific program for regulation and devalued its broadcast rights to the game. While the appeals court sided with the CRTC, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] overturned the ruling in December 2019 as a violation of the Broadcasting Act.<ref name=\"Financial Post\">{{Cite web|url=https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/nfl-broadcaster-notch-canadian-court-victory-on-super-bowl-ads|title=Super Bowl ad victory for Bell, NFL in Canada |work=Financial Post|date=2019-12-19|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n[[File:Super Bowl XLVII Kick Off.jpg|thumb|The opening [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]] of [[Super Bowl XLVII]]]]\nSuper Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most watched television broadcasts]]; [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 set an all-time record for viewership at the game, with an average of 114.4 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]], exceeding a record set the previous year at [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] (112.2 million).

In 1965, the company had first run a television commercial demonstrating the strength of its [[Lock (security device)|padlocks]], by having a person shoot it with a [[handgun]] in a failed attempt to breach it. The campaign was pulled after the company's advertising director, Edson F. Allen, realized the stunt could be imitated by those who were unsure of the commercial's authenticity. By the 1970s, Allen discussed the possibility of reviving the concept, but using a [[rifle]] rather than a handgun to make it harder to imitate. The resulting commercial would premiere in 1974 during [[Super Bowl VIII]]; despite concerns by the staff of Master Lock and their agency, [[Campbell Mithun]], over the content of the ad, the commercial was well received by the general public.<ref name=milwaukee-lock/><ref name=usatoday-masterlock/><ref name=wsj-newbieadvertisers>{{Cite web|last1=Perlberg|first1=Steven|title=Super Bowl Gets a Spike in Newbie Advertisers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156|access-date=March 25, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324224726/http://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156|archive-date=March 24, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cramer-Krasselt]] took over as Master Lock's agency later in the year, the company decided to make the gun ads a tradition, and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one featuring skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an \"event\" that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve Master Lock's market share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year.

The advertisement was filmed in 1979 and premiered that October, but did not gain mainstream attention until its airing during Super Bowl XIV. \"Hey Kid, Catch!\" became one of Greene's most famous roles; the ad would win a [[Clio Award]], spawn a [[made-for-TV movie]] on NBC entitled ''The Steeler and the Pittsburgh Kid'', and be re-made for other markets with local athletes.

The speech was, in turn, set to footage of people using their Ram vehicles to help others.<ref name=\"nyt-mlkad\"/><ref name=\"adweek-mlkad\"/>\n\nThe ad was widely criticized for using the words of MLK to promote a product. It was also pointed out that King had, ironically, criticized the advertising industry during the same sermon as being \"gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion\", explaining that \"in order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you're just buying that stuff.\" William B. Wachtel, co-founder of the [[Drum Major Institute]], stated that \"In a twist of irony, one of the specific evils Dr. King condemned was the exploitation of the drum major instinct by advertisers, particularly car advertisers\".<ref name=\"usatoday-mlkad\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/05/mlk-speech-used-rams-car-ad-goes-criticize-car-ads/306984002/|title=That Martin Luther King Jr. speech used in Ram's car ad?

This rule is intended to protect the investments of Canadian broadcasters in exclusive domestic broadcast rights, and also protect Canadian advertisers who had purchased their own advertising time on the Canadian network.

It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''winter'' comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun ''*wintru-'', whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wed-'' 'water' or a nasal infix variant ''*wend-''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Winter &#124; Origin and meaning of winter by Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2015-02-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.45\u00b0 to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.\n\nDuring winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of [[solar radiation]] strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.\n\nThe manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow\u2013prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation. For instance, within [[Canada]] (a country of cold winters), [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Great Plains]], a long way from the ocean, has a January high of {{convert|-11.3|C|F}} and a low of {{convert|-21.4|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&amp;StationName=Winnipeg&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Winnipeg|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905075212/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&StationName=Winnipeg&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|archivedate=5 September 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> In comparison, [[Vancouver]] on the west coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds has a January low of {{convert|1.4|C|F}} with days well above freezing at {{convert|6.9|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|title=Canadian climate normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Vancouver|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084829/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> Both places are at 49\u00b0N latitude, and in the same western half of the continent.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40\u00b0S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)\n\nAlso, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&pg=PA219|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8386-3916-0|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote=\"On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer.\"}}</ref> The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Ji\u00e9q\u00ec]]'' (known as \u7acb\u51ac ''l\u00ec d\u014dng'' \u2013 literally, \"establishment of winter\").\n\nThe three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This \"thermological winter\" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.\n\nCultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.\n\nSince by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.\n\n==Ecological reckoning and activity==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]\nEcological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.\n\nTo survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:\n*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate{{snd}}the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.\n*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.\n*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.\n*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].\n*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.\n*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.\n\nSome [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].\n\n==Exceptionally cold winters==\n[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]\n*1683\u20131684, \"The Great Frost\", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.

The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815\u20131816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September.

It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''winter'' comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun ''*wintru-'', whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wed-'' 'water' or a nasal infix variant ''*wend-''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Winter &#124; Origin and meaning of winter by Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2015-02-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44\u00b0 to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.\n\nDuring winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of [[solar radiation]] strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.\n\nThe manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow\u2013prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40\u00b0S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)\n\nAlso, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&pg=PA219|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8386-3916-0|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote=\"On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer.\"}}</ref> The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Ji\u00e9q\u00ec]]'' (known as \u7acb\u51ac ''l\u00ec d\u014dng'' \u2013 literally, \"establishment of winter\").\n\nThe three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This \"thermological winter\" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.\n\nCultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.\n\nSince by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.\n\n==Ecological reckoning and activity==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]\nEcological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.\n\nTo survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:\n*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate{{snd}}the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.\n*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.\n*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.\n*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].\n*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.\n*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.\n\nSome [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].\n\n==Exceptionally cold winters==\n[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]\n*1683\u20131684, \"The Great Frost\", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.

The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815\u20131816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September.

In February 1784, the ''North Carolina'' was frozen in Chesapeake Bay.\n*1794\u20131795, severe winter, with the coldest January in the UK and lowest temperature ever recorded in London: {{convert|-21|C}} on 25 January. The cold began on Christmas Eve and lasted until late March, with a few temporary warm-ups. The Severn and Thames froze, and frost fairs started up again. The French army tried to invade the Netherlands over its frozen rivers, while the Dutch fleet was stuck in its harbor. The winter had easterlies (from Siberia) as its dominant feature.\n*1813\u20131814, severe cold, last freeze-over of Thames, and last frost fair. (Removal of old London Bridge and changes to river's banks made freeze-overs less likely.)\n*1883\u20131888, colder temperatures worldwide, including an unbroken string of abnormally cold and brutal winters in the Upper Midwest, related to the explosion of [[Krakatoa]] in August 1883.  There was snow recorded in the UK as early as October and as late as July during this time period.\n*1976\u20131977, one of the coldest winters in the US in decades.\n*1985, Arctic outbreak in US resulting from shift in polar vortex, with many cold temperature records broken.\n*2002\u20132003 was an unusually cold winter in the Northern and Eastern US.\n*2010\u20132011, persistent bitter cold in the entire eastern half of the US from December onward, with few or no mid-winter warm-ups, and with cool conditions continuing into spring. [[La Ni\u00f1a]] and negative [[Arctic oscillation]] were strong factors. Heavy and persistent precipitation contributed to almost constant snow cover in the Northeastern US which finally receded in early May.\n*2011 was one of the coldest on record in [[New Zealand]] with sea level snow falling in [[Wellington]] in July for the first time in 35 years and a much heavier snowstorm for 3 days in a row in August.\n\n==Humans and winter==\nHumans are sensitive to cold, see [[hypothermia]]. [[Snowblindness]], [[norovirus]], [[seasonal depression]]. Slipping on black ice and falling [[icicle]]s are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter.\n\nOne of the most common diseases associated with winter is [[influenza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm|title=The Flu Season {{!}} CDC|last=Staff|first=|date=2019-11-07|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Siemiginowski Allegory of Winter.jpg|thumb|upright|''Allegory of Winter'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]] with [[Aeolus]]' Kingdom of the Winds, 1683, [[Wilan\u00f3w Palace]]]]\nIn [[Persian culture]], the winter solstice is called [[Yald\u0101]] (meaning: birth) and it has been celebrated for thousands of years.

The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the [[ventricle (heart) |ventricle]]s fail to pump blood around the body \u2013 because of this, it is classified as a [[cardiac arrest]] rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and prompt [[defibrillation]]. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying [[#Causes|cause]]. Patients may exhibit signs of [[agonal breathing]], which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but is a sign of [[Shock (circulatory)|hypoperfusion]] of the [[brainstem]].\n\nIt has an appearance on [[electrocardiography]] of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern. It may be described as 'coarse' or 'fine' depending on its amplitude, or as progressing from coarse to fine V-fib. Coarse V-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation, while fine V-fib can mimic the appearance of [[asystole]] on a [[defibrillator]] or [[cardiac monitor]] set to a low [[Gain (electronics) |gain]].  Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a [[cardiac rhythm]] compatible with life, whereas others will deliver [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and sometimes [[drug]]s as described in the [[advanced cardiac life support]] protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.\n\n==Causes==\nVentricular fibrillation has been described as \"chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart\" (Moe et al. 1964). A more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a \"turbulent, disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded [[electrocardiogram|electrocardiograph]]ic deflections continuously change in shape, magnitude and direction\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Robles de Medina | first1 = EO | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R | last3 = Coumel | first3 = P | others = et al |title= Definition of terms related to cardiac rhythm.

Recently described syndromes such as the [[Brugada Syndrome]] may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting [[ECG]] with evidence of [[right bundle branch block]] (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Brugada | first1 = P | last2 = Brugada | first2 = J |title=Right bundle branch block, persistent ST segment elevation and sudden cardiac death: a distinct clinical and electrocardiographic syndrome.

The product of a [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one [[pacemaker]]. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate [[re-entry ventricular arrhythmia]].\n\nMost myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of [[membrane potential]]. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the [[threshold potential]]. Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of [[potassium]] ions K<sup>+</sup>, a decreased intracellular concentration of [[sodium]] ions Na<sup>+</sup>, increased permeability to Na<sup>+</sup>, or a decreased permeability to K<sup>+</sup>. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to &ndash;50 to &ndash;60&nbsp;mV.\n\nMyocardial cells are exposed to different environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K<sup>+</sup> concentration, the increased external K<sup>+</sup> concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis.<ref>Ho K 1993</ref> When myocardial cell are exposed to hyperkalemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized as a result of the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of [[funny current]] even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.\n\n===Re-entry===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ventricular fibrillation]] -->\nThe role of re-entry or circus motion was demonstrated separately by [[G. R. Mines]] and [[W. E. Garrey]].<ref>Mines GR 1913, Garrey WE 1914</ref> Mines created a ring of excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the [[ray fish]]. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the [[turtle]] ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, it is necessary that there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of [[ischemic]] or [[infarct]]ed myocardium, or underlying [[Myocardial scarring|scar tissue]].\n\nIt is possible to think of the advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance\u2014the propagation velocity\u2014will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the [[wavefront]].\n\nIn clinical practice, therefore, factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through [[hypertrophy]] or dilatation, drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease. Therefore, the substrate of ventricular fibrillation is transient or permanent conduction block. Block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of myocardium for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry.\n\n===Triggered activity===\nTriggered activity can occur due to the presence of [[Afterdepolarization|afterdepolarisations]]. These are depolarising oscillations in the membrane voltage induced by preceding action potentials. These can occur before or after full repolarisation of the fiber and as such are termed either early (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs). All afterdepolarisations may not reach threshold potential, but, if they do, they can trigger another afterdepolarisation, and thus self-perpetuate.\n\n====Power spectrum====\n[[Image:Lead II rhythm generated ventricular fibrilation VF.JPG|thumb|Ventricular fibrillation as seen in lead II]]\nThe distribution of frequency and power of a waveform can be expressed as a power spectrum in which the contribution of different waveform frequencies to the waveform under analysis is measured. This can be expressed as either the dominant or peak frequency, i.e., the frequency with the greatest power or the median frequency, which divides the spectrum in two halves.\n\nFrequency analysis has many other uses in medicine and in cardiology, including analysis of heart rate variability and assessment of cardiac function, as well as in imaging and acoustics.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Shusterman V, Beigel A, Shah SI, etal |title=Changes in autonomic activity and ventricular repolarization |journal=J Electrocardiol |volume=Suppl |issue= |pages=185\u201392 |series=32 |year=1999 |pmid=10688324 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-0736(99)90078-X|url=}}<!-- other PMIDs  10413369 9857869 --></ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kaplan SR, Bashein G, Sheehan FH, etal |title=Three-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of annular shape changes in the normal and regurgitant mitral valve |journal=Am.

The use of this is often dictated around the world by [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] or [[Advanced Life Support]] algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly [[epinephrine]], after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.\n\nThe [[precordial thump]] is a manoeuver promoted as a mechanical alternative to defibrillation. Some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once and only in the case of witnessed and monitored V-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully [[cardioversion|cardioverting]] a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nPeople who survive a \"V-fib arrest\" and who make a good recovery are often considered for an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nSudden [[cardiac arrest]] is the leading cause of death in the industrialised world. It exacts a significant mortality with approximately 70,000 to 90,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United Kingdom, and survival rates are only 2%.<ref>[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] Guidelines 2000</ref> The majority of these deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation secondary to [[myocardial infarction]], or \"heart attack\".<ref>Myerburg RJ et al. 1995</ref> During ventricular fibrillation, [[cardiac output]] drops to zero, and, unless remedied promptly, death usually ensues within minutes.\n\n==History==\n\nLyman Brewer suggests that the first recorded account of ventricular fibrillation dates as far back as 1500 BC, and can be found in the [[Ebers papyrus]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. The extract recorded 3500 years ago may even date from as far back as 3500 BC. It states: \"When the heart is diseased, its work is imperfectly performed: the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive, so that you cannot feel them \u2026 if the heart trembles, has little power and sinks, the disease is advanced and death is near.\" A book authored by Jo Miles suggests that it may even go back farther. Tests done on frozen remains found in the Himalayas seemed fairly conclusive that the first known case of ventricular fibrillation dates back to at least 2500 BC.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brewer LA |title=Sphygmology through the centuries.

Subsequent to this in 1850, fibrillation was described by Ludwig and Hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a \"[[Michael Faraday|Faradic]]\" (electrical) current to the heart.<ref>Hoffa M et al. 1850</ref>\n\nIn 1874, [[Alfred Vulpian|Edm\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Alfred Vulpian]] coined the term ''mouvement fibrillaire'', a term that he seems to have used to describe both atrial and ventricular fibrillation.<ref>Vulpian A 1874</ref> John A. MacWilliam, a physiologist who had trained under Ludwig and who subsequently became Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Aberdeen]], gave an accurate description of the [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] in 1887. This definition still holds today, and is interesting in the fact that his studies and description predate the use of [[electrocardiography]]. His description is as follows: \"The ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction, whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure, the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue \u2026 The cardiac pump is thrown out of gear, and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls.\" MacWilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation and was one of the first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart.<ref>MacWilliam JA 1887</ref>\n\nThe first [[electrocardiogram]] recording of ventricular fibrillation was by August Hoffman in a paper published in 1912.<ref>Hoffman A 1912</ref> At this time, two other researchers, George Ralph Mines and Garrey, working separately, produced work demonstrating the phenomenon of [[Ventricular fibrillation#Re-entry|circus movement]] and [[Ventricular fibrillation#Re-entry|re-entry]] as possible substrates for the generation of arrhythmias. This work was also accompanied by Lewis, who performed further outstanding work into the concept of \"circus movement.\"\n\nLater milestones include the work by W. J. Kerr and W. L. Bender in 1922, who produced an electrocardiogram showing [[ventricular tachycardia]] evolving into ventricular fibrillation.<ref>Kerr, WJ et al. 1922</ref> The re-entry mechanism was also advocated by DeBoer, who showed that ventricular fibrillation could be induced in late systole with a single shock to a frog heart.<ref>De Boer S 1923</ref> The concept of \"R on T ectopics\" was further brought out by Katz in 1928.<ref>Katz LN 1928</ref> This was called the \u201cvulnerable period\u201d by Wiggers and Wegria in 1940, who brought to attention the concept of the danger of [[Premature ventricular contraction|premature ventricular beats]] occurring on a [[T wave]].\n\nAnother definition of VF was produced by Wiggers in 1940. He described ventricular fibrillation as \"an incoordinate type of contraction which, despite a high [[metabolic rate]] of the [[myocardium]], produces no useful beats. As a result, the arterial pressure falls abruptly to very low levels, and death results within six to eight minutes from anemia [ischemia] of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]\".<ref>Wiggers, CJ et al. 1940</ref>\n\nSpontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Defibrillation]] is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an [[electric shock]] to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Atrial fibrillation]]\n*

The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the [[ventricle (heart) |ventricle]]s fail to pump blood around the body \u2013 because of this, it is classified as a [[cardiac arrest]] rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and prompt [[defibrillation]]. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying [[#Causes|cause]]. Patients may exhibit signs of [[agonal breathing]], which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but is a sign of [[Shock (circulatory)|hypoperfusion]] of the [[brainstem]].\n\nIt has an appearance on [[electrocardiography]] of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern. It may be described as 'coarse' or 'fine' depending on its amplitude, or as progressing from coarse to fine V-fib. Coarse V-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation, while fine V-fib can mimic the appearance of [[asystole]] on a [[defibrillator]] or [[cardiac monitor]] set to a low [[Gain (electronics) |gain]].  Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a [[cardiac rhythm]] compatible with life, whereas others will deliver [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and sometimes [[drug]]s as described in the [[advanced cardiac life support]] protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.\n\n==Causes==\nVentricular fibrillation has been described as \"chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart\" (Moe et al. 1964). A more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a \"turbulent, disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded [[electrocardiogram|electrocardiograph]]ic deflections continuously change in shape, magnitude and direction\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Robles de Medina | first1 = EO | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R | last3 = Coumel | first3 = P | others = et al |title= Definition of terms related to cardiac rhythm.

Recently described syndromes such as the [[Brugada Syndrome]] may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias.

The product of a [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one [[pacemaker]]. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate [[re-entry ventricular arrhythmia]].\n\nMost myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of [[membrane potential]]. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the [[threshold potential]]. Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of [[potassium]] ions K<sup>+</sup>, a decreased intracellular concentration of [[sodium]] ions Na<sup>+</sup>, increased permeability to Na<sup>+</sup>, or a decreased permeability to K<sup>+</sup>. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to &ndash;50 to &ndash;60&nbsp;mV.\n\nMyocardial cells are exposed to different environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K<sup>+</sup> concentration, the increased external K<sup>+</sup> concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis.<ref>Ho K 1993</ref> When myocardial cell are exposed to hyperkalemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized as a result of the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of [[funny current]] even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.\n\n===Re-entry===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ventricular fibrillation]] -->\nThe role of re-entry or circus motion was demonstrated separately by [[G. R. Mines]] and [[W. E. Garrey]].<ref>Mines GR 1913, Garrey WE 1914</ref> Mines created a ring of excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the [[ray fish]]. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the [[turtle]] ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, it is necessary that there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of [[ischemic]] or [[infarct]]ed myocardium, or underlying [[Myocardial scarring|scar tissue]].\n\nIt is possible to think of the advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance\u2014the propagation velocity\u2014will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the [[wavefront]].\n\nIn clinical practice, therefore, factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through [[hypertrophy]] or dilatation, drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease. Therefore, the substrate of ventricular fibrillation is transient or permanent conduction block. Block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of myocardium for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry.\n\n===Triggered activity===\nTriggered activity can occur due to the presence of [[Afterdepolarization|afterdepolarisations]]. These are depolarising oscillations in the membrane voltage induced by preceding action potentials. These can occur before or after full repolarisation of the fiber and as such are termed either early (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs). All afterdepolarisations may not reach threshold potential, but, if they do, they can trigger another afterdepolarisation, and thus self-perpetuate.\n\n====Power spectrum====\n[[Image:Lead II rhythm generated ventricular fibrilation VF.JPG|thumb|Ventricular fibrillation as seen in lead II]]\nThe distribution of frequency and power of a waveform can be expressed as a power spectrum in which the contribution of different waveform frequencies to the waveform under analysis is measured. This can be expressed as either the dominant or peak frequency, i.e., the frequency with the greatest power or the median frequency, which divides the spectrum in two halves.\n\nFrequency analysis has many other uses in medicine and in cardiology, including analysis of heart rate variability and assessment of cardiac function, as well as in imaging and acoustics.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Shusterman V, Beigel A, Shah SI, etal |title=Changes in autonomic activity and ventricular repolarization |journal=J Electrocardiol |volume=Suppl |issue= |pages=185\u201392 |series=32 |year=1999 |pmid=10688324 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-0736(99)90078-X|url=}}<!-- other PMIDs  10413369 9857869 --></ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kaplan SR, Bashein G, Sheehan FH, etal |title=Three-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of annular shape changes in the normal and regurgitant mitral valve |journal=Am.

The use of this is often dictated around the world by [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] or [[Advanced Life Support]] algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly [[epinephrine]], after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.\n\nThe [[precordial thump]] is a manoeuver promoted as a mechanical alternative to defibrillation. Some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once and only in the case of witnessed and monitored V-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully [[cardioversion|cardioverting]] a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nPeople who survive a \"V-fib arrest\" and who make a good recovery are often considered for an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nSudden [[cardiac arrest]] is the leading cause of death in the industrialised world. It exacts a significant mortality with approximately 70,000 to 90,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United Kingdom, and survival rates are only 2%.<ref>[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] Guidelines 2000</ref> The majority of these deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation secondary to [[myocardial infarction]], or \"heart attack\".<ref>Myerburg RJ et al. 1995</ref> During ventricular fibrillation, [[cardiac output]] drops to zero, and, unless remedied promptly, death usually ensues within minutes.\n\n==History==\n\nLyman Brewer suggests that the first recorded account of ventricular fibrillation dates as far back as 1500 BC, and can be found in the [[Ebers papyrus]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. The extract recorded 3500 years ago may even date from as far back as 3500 BC. It states: \"When the heart is diseased, its work is imperfectly performed: the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive, so that you cannot feel them \u2026 if the heart trembles, has little power and sinks, the disease is advanced and death is near.\" A book authored by Jo Miles suggests that it may even go back farther. Tests done on frozen remains found in the Himalayas seemed fairly conclusive that the first known case of ventricular fibrillation dates back to at least 2500 BC.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brewer LA |title=Sphygmology through the centuries.

Subsequent to this in 1850, fibrillation was described by Ludwig and Hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a \"[[Michael Faraday|Faradic]]\" (electrical) current to the heart.<ref>Hoffa M et al. 1850</ref>\n\nIn 1874, [[Alfred Vulpian|Edm\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Alfred Vulpian]] coined the term ''mouvement fibrillaire'', a term that he seems to have used to describe both atrial and ventricular fibrillation.<ref>Vulpian A 1874</ref> John A. MacWilliam, a physiologist who had trained under Ludwig and who subsequently became Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Aberdeen]], gave an accurate description of the [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] in 1887. This definition still holds today, and is interesting in the fact that his studies and description predate the use of [[electrocardiography]]. His description is as follows: \"The ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction, whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure, the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue \u2026 The cardiac pump is thrown out of gear, and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls.\" MacWilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation and was one of the first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart.<ref>MacWilliam JA 1887</ref>\n\nThe first [[electrocardiogram]] recording of ventricular fibrillation was by August Hoffman in a paper published in 1912.<ref>Hoffman A 1912</ref> At this time, two other researchers, George Ralph Mines and Garrey, working separately, produced work demonstrating the phenomenon of [[Ventricular fibrillation#Re-entry|circus movement]] and [[Ventricular fibrillation#Re-entry|re-entry]] as possible substrates for the generation of arrhythmias. This work was also accompanied by Lewis, who performed further outstanding work into the concept of \"circus movement.\"\n\nLater milestones include the work by W. J. Kerr and W. L. Bender in 1922, who produced an electrocardiogram showing [[ventricular tachycardia]] evolving into ventricular fibrillation.<ref>Kerr, WJ et al. 1922</ref> The re-entry mechanism was also advocated by DeBoer, who showed that ventricular fibrillation could be induced in late systole with a single shock to a frog heart.<ref>De Boer S 1923</ref> The concept of \"R on T ectopics\" was further brought out by Katz in 1928.<ref>Katz LN 1928</ref> This was called the \u201cvulnerable period\u201d by Wiggers and Wegria in 1940, who brought to attention the concept of the danger of [[Premature ventricular contraction|premature ventricular beats]] occurring on a [[T wave]].\n\nAnother definition of VF was produced by Wiggers in 1940. He described ventricular fibrillation as \"an incoordinate type of contraction which, despite a high [[metabolic rate]] of the [[myocardium]], produces no useful beats. As a result, the arterial pressure falls abruptly to very low levels, and death results within six to eight minutes from anemia [ischemia] of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]\".<ref>Wiggers, CJ et al. 1940</ref>\n\nSpontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Defibrillation]] is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an [[electric shock]] to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Atrial fibrillation]]\n* [[Electric shock]]\n* [[Flatline]]\n* [[Osborn wave]]\n* [[Re-entry ventricular arrhythmia]]\n* [[Ventricular flutter]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = 13798  \n|  ICD10           = {{ICD10|I|49|0|i|40}}  \n|  ICD9            = {{ICD9|427.41}}  \n|  ICDO            =  \n|  OMIM            =  \n|  MedlinePlus     = 007200 \n|  eMedicineSubj   =  \n|  eMedicineTopic  = 158712 \n|  MeshID          = D014693 \n}}\n* [http://thevirtualheart.org/VFindex.html Interactive models and information] on ventricular fibrillation and other arrhythmias\n\n{{Heart diseases}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ventricular Fibrillation}}\n[[Category:Cardiac arrhythmia]]\n[[Category:Medical emergencies]]\n[[Category:Causes of death]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTEM]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"}
