Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, baked clay, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.  Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.\n\nTiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.\n\n== Decorative tile work and coloured brick ==\n[[File:Grande Maison de Blanc Fleurs.JPG|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] tiles in [[Bruxelles]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nDecorative tilework or [[tile art]] should be distinguished from [[mosaic]], where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned [[tesserae]], each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone.\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Ancient Middle East===\nThe earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] (ca. 575 BC), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].\n\nThe use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in [[Mesopotamia]] where river mud was found in abundance along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of [[clay]] heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950\u00b0 and 1,150\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations special molds had to be made.\n\n=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===\nRooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of [[Kalibangan]], [[Kot Bala|Balakot]] and Ahladino<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.202140|quote=kalibangan tiles.|title=Indian History|year=1926|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259063237|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=balakot+tiles+indus+valley&source=bl&ots=jcjUAvvfQ1&sig=eBjMQ80bDuX8BiWjyb6_VdkPPEU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY9MTI_PHcAhVJYo8KHWZ6A8IQ6AEwDnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=balakot%20tiles%20indus%20valley&f=false|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079072|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTiling was used in the second century by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools.

First half of the 15th century, [[Shah-i-Zinda]]]]\nThe golden age of Persian tilework began during the [[Timurid Empire]]. In the [[moraq]] technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the [[Jame mosque of Yazd|Jame Mosque]] of [[Yazd]] (AD 1324\u20131365), [[Goharshad Mosque]] (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the [[Molana Mosque]] (AD 1444).<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" />\n\nOther important tile techniques of this time include [[girih tiles]], with their characteristic white girih, or straps.\n\n[[Mihrab]]s, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in [[Isfahan]] is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher's art]] and abstract ornament. The [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arch]], framing the mihrab's niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century [[Qur'an]].<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite book\n| title  = Gardner's Art Through The Ages, A Global History\n| author = Fred S.

Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of ''[[cuerda seca]]'' tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nDuring the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid period]], mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a ''haft rang'' (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]], when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange.<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" /> The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually [[black]], [[white]], [[ultramarine]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[red]], [[yellow]] and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]].\n\n[[File:001117 15-44-2002-To-grupper-rosa-Qajar-Fliser2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Two panels of [[earthenware]] tiles painted with [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazes]] over a white glaze. (Iran 19thC)]]\nThe [[Persianate]] tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[\u0130znik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, [[mosque]]s and [[t\u00fcrbe]] mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and [[frieze]]s of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nTile at Topkapi Palace Istanbul.jpg|Tile in the [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\nEnderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|Enderun library, Topkapi Palace\nWindow Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince, Topkapi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Nadir Madrasah Phoenix.JPG|thumb|Phoenix on the portal of Nadir Divan-Beghi Madrasah, [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]\nIslamic buildings in [[Bukhara]] in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In [[South Asia]] monuments and shrines adorned with [[Qashani|Kashi]] tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the [[Mughal period]].\n\n[[File:Mekhnes Place El-Hedine Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zellige]] tilework in the [[Palace El-Hedine]], [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]]]]\nThe [[zellige]] tradition of Arabic [[North Africa]] uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like [[enamelling]], but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.\n\n[[File:WindowCrestAzulejos.JPG|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Azulejos]], [[Mexico City]], 18th century, with [[azulejo]]s]]\n[[Azulejo]]s are derived from [[zellige]], and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some azujelos are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. [[Azulejo]]s were also used in Latin American architecture.\n\n<gallery>\nBeja26.jpg|[[Quadra (architecture)]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] covered with azulejos in carpet style (17th c.); [[Museu da Reinha D.

Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with [[Old testament]] scenes shown on the floor in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] are an example.

Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].\n\n=== Far East ===\nThere are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored zellige tiles of [[Morocco]] and the surrounding countries. With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.\n[[File:Demorganducks.jpg|right|thumb|[[William de Morgan]], fantastic ducks on 6-inch tile with luster highlights, Fulham period]]\n\n=== Modern Europe ===\nThe Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the [[Gothic Revival]], but also the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher [[encaustic tile]] was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of [[hygiene]] in kitchens. [[William De Morgan]] was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.\n\nSince the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.\n\n[[File:Quiosco modernista Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A late [[Art Nouveau]] kiosk (1923) in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] covered with tiles from [[Manises]], Spain.]]\n\nPortugal and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] continue their tradition of ''azulejo'' tilework today, with [[azulejo]]s used to decorate buildings, ships,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 18 August 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109050534/http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| archivedate = 9 January 2017\n}}</ref> and even rocks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Casa da M\u00fasica.

Modern materials such as [[concrete]], glass and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. A large number of shapes (or \"profiles\") of roof tiles have evolved.\n\n== Floor tiles ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] -->\n[[File:Making mosaic tiles.webm|thumb|Making mosaic tiles]]\n[[File:QVB mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The elaborate floor pattern of the Sydney [[Queen Victoria Building]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus floor tile.jpg|thumb|right|Floor tile in Karpas, northeastern [[Cyprus]]]]\n[[File:6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles]]\n[[File:Stone tile patio, Hawaii, 1960.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patio]] with stone tile, [[Hawaii]], US 1960]]\nThese are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or [[glass tiles]] for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] consisting of [[sand]], [[cement]] and often a [[latex]] additive for extra adhesion. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor [[grout]], but traditionally mortar was used.<ref>https://goodguyflooring.com/blogs/home-improvement-blog/diy-guide-how-to-install-tile-flooring</ref>\n\nNatural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically \"riven\" (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that \"ramp\" between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.\n\nSome stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile.\n\nThe hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.\n\nThe tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.\n\nMost vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.\n\nRubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors. These tiles can also be useful as impact resistance flooring for senior citizens and those who have sensitive joints.\n\nPlastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.\n\n== Ceiling tiles ==\n{{main|Ceiling tile}}\nCeiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.\n\nMineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16742 Missing Ceiling Tiles.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Congress Office of Compliance]], 2008.</ref>\n\nCeiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.\n\nModern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as [[dropped ceiling]]s.\n\n== Materials and processes ==\n=== Ceramic ===\nCeramic materials for tiles include [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Terracotta]] is a traditional material used for roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271\n| title       = Environmentally Friendly Cities: Proceedings of Plea 1998, Passive and Low Energy Architecture, 1998, Lisbon, Portugal, June 1998\n| last        = Maldonado\n| first       = Eduardo\n| date        = 19 November 2014\n| publisher   = Routledge\n| isbn        = 978-1-134-25622-8\n| language    = en\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180506165629/https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Terracotta+is+a+traditional+material+used+for+roof+tiles.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49vD_h93XAhUN0mMKHUFrA9gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Terracotta%20is%20a%20traditional%20material%20used%20for%20roof%20tiles.&f=false\n| archivedate = 6 May 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcelain tiles ====\n{{Main|Porcelain tile}}\n\nThis is a US term, and defined in [[ASTM]] standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious.

Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, baked clay, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.  Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.\n\nTiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.\n\n== Decorative tile work and coloured brick ==\n[[File:Grande Maison de Blanc Fleurs.JPG|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] tiles in [[Bruxelles]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nDecorative tilework or [[tile art]] should be distinguished from [[mosaic]], where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned [[tesserae]], each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone.\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Ancient Middle East===\nThe earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] (ca. 575 BC), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].\n\nThe use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in [[Mesopotamia]] where river mud was found in abundance along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of [[clay]] heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950\u00b0 and 1,150\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations special molds had to be made.\n\n=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===\nRooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of [[Kalibangan]], [[Kot Bala|Balakot]] and Ahladino<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.202140|quote=kalibangan tiles.|title=Indian History|year=1926|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259063237|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=balakot+tiles+indus+valley&source=bl&ots=jcjUAvvfQ1&sig=eBjMQ80bDuX8BiWjyb6_VdkPPEU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY9MTI_PHcAhVJYo8KHWZ6A8IQ6AEwDnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=balakot%20tiles%20indus%20valley&f=false|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079072|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTiling was used in the second century by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools.

First half of the 15th century, [[Shah-i-Zinda]]]]\nThe golden age of Persian tilework began during the [[Timurid Empire]]. In the [[moraq]] technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the [[Jame mosque of Yazd|Jame Mosque]] of [[Yazd]] (AD 1324\u20131365), [[Goharshad Mosque]] (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the [[Molana Mosque]] (AD 1444).<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" />\n\nOther important tile techniques of this time include [[girih tiles]], with their characteristic white girih, or straps.\n\n[[Mihrab]]s, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in [[Isfahan]] is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher's art]] and abstract ornament. The [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arch]], framing the mihrab's niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century [[Qur'an]].<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite book\n| title  = Gardner's Art Through The Ages, A Global History\n| author = Fred S.

Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of ''[[cuerda seca]]'' tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nDuring the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid period]], mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a ''haft rang'' (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]], when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange.<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" /> The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually [[black]], [[white]], [[ultramarine]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[red]], [[yellow]] and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]].\n\n[[File:001117 15-44-2002-To-grupper-rosa-Qajar-Fliser2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Two panels of [[earthenware]] tiles painted with [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazes]] over a white glaze. (Iran 19thC)]]\nThe [[Persianate]] tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[\u0130znik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, [[mosque]]s and [[t\u00fcrbe]] mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and [[frieze]]s of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nTile at Topkapi Palace Istanbul.jpg|Tile in the [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\nEnderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|Enderun library, Topkapi Palace\nWindow Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince, Topkapi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Nadir Madrasah Phoenix.JPG|thumb|Phoenix on the portal of Nadir Divan-Beghi Madrasah, [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]\nIslamic buildings in [[Bukhara]] in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In [[South Asia]] monuments and shrines adorned with [[Qashani|Kashi]] tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the [[Mughal period]].\n\n[[File:Mekhnes Place El-Hedine Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zellige]] tilework in the [[Palace El-Hedine]], [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]]]]\nThe [[zellige]] tradition of Arabic [[North Africa]] uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like [[enamelling]], but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.\n\n[[File:WindowCrestAzulejos.JPG|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Azulejos]], [[Mexico City]], 18th century, with [[azulejo]]s]]\n[[Azulejo]]s are derived from [[zellige]], and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some azujelos are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. [[Azulejo]]s were also used in Latin American architecture.\n\n<gallery>\nBeja26.jpg|[[Quadra (architecture)]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] covered with azulejos in carpet style (17th c.); [[Museu da Reinha D.

Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with [[Old testament]] scenes shown on the floor in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] are an example.

Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].\n\n=== Far East ===\nThere are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored zellige tiles of [[Morocco]] and the surrounding countries. With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.\n[[File:Demorganducks.jpg|right|thumb|[[William de Morgan]], fantastic ducks on 6-inch tile with luster highlights, Fulham period]]\n\n=== Modern Europe ===\nThe Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the [[Gothic Revival]], but also the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher [[encaustic tile]] was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of [[hygiene]] in kitchens. [[William De Morgan]] was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.\n\nSince the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.\n\n[[File:Quiosco modernista Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A late [[Art Nouveau]] kiosk (1923) in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] covered with tiles from [[Manises]], Spain.]]\n\nPortugal and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] continue their tradition of ''azulejo'' tilework today, with [[azulejo]]s used to decorate buildings, ships,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 18 August 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109050534/http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| archivedate = 9 January 2017\n}}</ref> and even rocks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Casa da M\u00fasica.

Modern materials such as [[concrete]], glass and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. A large number of shapes (or \"profiles\") of roof tiles have evolved.\n\n== Floor tiles ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] -->\n[[File:Making mosaic tiles.webm|thumb|Making mosaic tiles]]\n[[File:QVB mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The elaborate floor pattern of the Sydney [[Queen Victoria Building]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus floor tile.jpg|thumb|right|Floor tile in Karpas, northeastern [[Cyprus]]]]\n[[File:6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles]]\n[[File:Stone tile patio, Hawaii, 1960.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patio]] with stone tile, [[Hawaii]], US 1960]]\nThese are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or [[glass tiles]] for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] consisting of [[sand]], [[cement]] and often a [[latex]] additive for extra adhesion. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor [[grout]], but traditionally mortar was used.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically \"riven\" (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that \"ramp\" between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.\n\nSome stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile.\n\nThe hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.\n\nThe tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.\n\nMost vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.\n\nRubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors.\n\nPlastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.\n\n== Ceiling tiles ==\n{{main|Ceiling tile}}\nCeiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.\n\nMineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16742 Missing Ceiling Tiles.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Congress Office of Compliance]], 2008.</ref>\n\nCeiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.\n\nModern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as [[dropped ceiling]]s.\n\n== Materials and processes ==\n=== Ceramic ===\nCeramic materials for tiles include [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Terracotta]] is a traditional material used for roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271\n| title       = Environmentally Friendly Cities: Proceedings of Plea 1998, Passive and Low Energy Architecture, 1998, Lisbon, Portugal, June 1998\n| last        = Maldonado\n| first       = Eduardo\n| date        = 19 November 2014\n| publisher   = Routledge\n| isbn        = 978-1-134-25622-8\n| language    = en\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180506165629/https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Terracotta+is+a+traditional+material+used+for+roof+tiles.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49vD_h93XAhUN0mMKHUFrA9gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Terracotta%20is%20a%20traditional%20material%20used%20for%20roof%20tiles.&f=false\n| archivedate = 6 May 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcelain tiles ====\n{{Main|Porcelain tile}}\n\nThis is a US term, and defined in [[ASTM]] standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious.

Compared with the [[laser engraving]]s, diamond etching is in almost every circumstance more permanent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Mathematics of tiling ==\nCertain shapes of tiles, most obviously [[rectangle]]s, can be replicated to cover a surface with no gaps. These shapes are said to ''[[Tessellation|tessellate]]'' (from the [[Latin]] ''tessella'', 'tile') and such a tiling is called a [[tessellation]]. Geometric patterns of some Islamic polychrome decorative tilings are rather complicated (see [[Islamic geometric patterns]] and, in particular, [[Girih tiles]]), even up to supposedly quaziperiodic ones, similar to [[Penrose tiling#Penrose tilings and art|Penrose tilings]].\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n| author1       = Carboni, S.\n| author2       = Masuya, T.\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title         = ''Persian tiles''\n| location      = New York\n| publisher     = The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n| year          = 1993\n| url           = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/90309\n}}\n* Marilyn Y.

The Latitude competes with the [[ThinkPad]] series from [[Lenovo]] (formerly IBM), the [[HP EliteBook|EliteBook]] series from [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Acer TravelMate|Travelmate]] series from [[Acer Inc.|Acer]]. The \"Rugged (Extreme)\", \"XFR\" and \"ATG\" models compete primarily with [[Panasonic]]'s [[Toughbook]] line of rugged computers.\n\n==Overview and product type==\n\nThe Dell Latitude is a laptop family from Dell Computers, intended for business use. By contrast, the [[Dell Inspiron]] is aimed at the consumer market and its specifications change regularly. Whereas Inspiron may change vendors or components several times over the course of a single model, the Latitude line generally retains identical components throughout its production. This design is intended to simplify maintenance and support tasks for large corporations, allowing components to be easily swapped between models.\n[[File:D630.jpg|thumb|Dell Latitude D630]]\n\nThe Dell Latitude series have dropped the initial alphabet in newer model types (as in Latitude 7480 whose predecessor was E7470), and became the successor to the popular Latitude E, D, C, and X series. The Latitudes from the early 1990s up until the C*00 lines weren't in a set \"series\", instead going under the models CP and XP with modifiers at the end, e.g.: XPi, CP M233.\n\nIn the past, the \"mainstream\" line was the 6 series, being the C6x0, D6x0, and E64x0 lines, but as of 2015 this line has been discontinued and replaced by both the 5 series and the 7 series. The 15\" \"Premium\" line was the 8 series, until the E-series merged this line with the 6 series (Model numbers being along the lines of C8x0 or D8x0). The \"budget\" line was the 5 series, but as of 2015 the 5 series and 7 series Latitude laptops are the primary lines of Latitude laptops. The 3 series has replaced the 5 series as the budget line. Dell has also since dropped the E from the Latitude line (due to switching to a USB C/Thunderbolt dock system, rather than the e-Port analog pin-system docks), and the models are delineated by number now, e.g.: Latitude 5480, 5570. The second number in the model (As in, 5'''4'''70 or 7'''2'''80) indicates the size of the screen in the laptop.\n\nThe current Dell Latitude lineup is as follows:\n\nLatitude 3xxx series. Budget models intended for education or home office environments, available in 13.3\"/14\"/15.6\" trims.\n\nLatitude 5xxx series. Mainstream line, available in 11.1\"/12.5\"/13.3\"/14\"/15.6\" trims.\n\nLatitude 7xxx series. Premium \"ultrabooks\", available in 12.5\"/13.3\"/14\" trims only.\n\nLatitude computers are also differentiated in their feature sets, due to their business focus. For example, they often include security features such as smartcard and contactless smartcard, and TPM security, which are not needed by most consumers. A lid clasp (as opposed to a magnetic latching system), DisplayPort video out (as opposed to HDMI), and support for legacy standards are all results of the requirements of the business market.\n\nSome models also have the capability of [[Latitude ON]] which can be selected during the configuration of the laptop. Latitude ON is essentially a system within a system. It requires a separate add on module which contains its own [[microprocessor]] and [[Operating system]]. This allows the laptop to function in the realm of a [[Netbook]].\n\n==Current models==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |'''Latitude''' 2010-2019\n|-\n!\n!Type\n!**00\n(2010)\n!**10\n(2011)\n!**20\n(2012)\n!**30\n(2013)\n!**40\n(2014)\n!**50\n(2015)\n!**70\n(2016)\n!**80\n(2017)\n!**90\n(2018)\n!**00\n(2019)\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" |Top-class\n|-\n|16\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Ultraportable ([[ultrabook]])\n| Z600\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |14\"\n! colspan=3 |\n|6430u\n|E7440\n|E7450\n|E7470\n|7480\n|7490\n|7400\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|7400 2-in-1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |13.3\"\n|E4300\n|E4310\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|7370\n|7380\n|7390\n|7300\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Convertible\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|7350\n!\n|7389\n|7390 2-in-1\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |12.5\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|7275\n|7285\n!\n|7200 2-in-1\n|-\n|Ultraportable ([[ultrabook]])\n|E4200\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|E7240\n|E7250\n|E7270\n|7280\n|7290\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" |Middle class\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |15.6\"\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Mainstream\n|E6500\n|E6510\n|E6520\n|E6530\n|E6540\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|E5540\n|E5550\n|E5570\n|5580\n|5590\n|5500\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|5591\n|5501\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |14\"\n|E6400\n|E6410\n|E6420\n|E6430\n|E6440\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|E5440\n|E5450\n|E5470\n|5480\n|5490\n|5400\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|5495\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|5491\n|5401\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |13.3\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|E6320\n|E6330\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|5300\n|-\n|2-in-1\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|XT3\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|5300 2-in-1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |12.5\"\n|Mainstream\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|E6220\n|E6230\n!\n|E5250\n|E5270\n|5280\n|5290\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2-in-1\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|5285\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|5289\n|5290 2-in-1\n!\n|-\n|10.8\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|5175/9\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|10.1\"\n|Tablet\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" |10-ST2\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" |Entry-level\n|-\n|15.6\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Mainstream\n|E5500\n|E5510\n|E5520\n|E5530\n|E3540\n|E3550\n|3570\n|3580\n|3590\n|3500\n|-\n|14\"\n|E5400\n|E5410\n|E5420\n|E5430\n|E3440\n|E3450\n|3470\n|3480\n|3490\n|3400\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |13.3\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|3380\n!\n|3301\n|-\n|Entry (educational)\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|3300\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2-in-1\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|3379\n!\n|3390 2-in-1\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |11.6\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|3189\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Netbook]]\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|3150\n|3160\n|3180\n|3190\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10.1\"\n|2100\n|2110\n|2120\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|-\n|Tablet\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|10-ST2e\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|}\n(List does not include rugged modifications).\n\n[[File:IMG-20110304-00151.jpg|thumb|200px|right|RFID (Optional) location on a Latitude E6410]]\n\nDell used the \"E-series\" name up through the 2016 models, and new 2017 models drop the \"E.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Latitude E7470|url=http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e7470-ultrabook/pd|website=Dell|publisher=Dell|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Latitude 7480|url=http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-14-7480-laptop/pd|website=Dell|publisher=Dell|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref> and Dell E-Port Replicator with it. As of February 2017, Latitude computers are available in three series: the 3000, 5000, and 7000. The 3000 series is designed to be entry-level, similar to the previous Latitude E55xx and Latitude E54xx laptops. The 5000 series is mid-range, similar to the Latitude E64xx and E65xx. It includes a high performance subseries whose model designations end in 1. These devices are available with [[thermal design power|higher-TDP]] processors, [[video card|discrete graphics]] and [[NVM Express|NVMe]] [[Solid-state drive|SSD]]s. The 7000 series consists of high-end [[Ultrabook]] computers, introduced in 2014 with the Latitude E7440 and E7240.\n\nAside from the 3000, 5000, and 7000 series, Dell also provides an Education and Rugged Series of Latitude computers. The Education series laptops are designed for use in educational institutions. They're not especially powerful, and are more geared towards office applications or internet-based applications. The Rugged series laptops are similar to the previous Latitude XFR computers. They are designed with extra durability in mind.\n\n=== xx10 Models (2020) ===\n* '''9510 2-in-1''': 15.0\" lightweight

Dx30 revision. The models are the D4x0 (12.1\" Ultra Mobile), D5x0 (14.1 or 15.0\" standard aspect screen except for D531, plastic case, value model), D6x0 (14.1\" Corporate model) and D8x0 (15.4\" high-resolution model) most models are based on the Intel [[Core 2 Duo]] and the Intel Santa Rosa chipset, with the exception being the D531. Ever since the D420, D620, and D800, the D-series features wide aspect LCD screens: 12.1\", 14.1\", and 15.4\" respectively.\n\n===Latitude D6x0 series===\nThe Latitude D6x0 series is the 14\"/14.1\" corporate model. It aims to combine heavy-duty power with reasonable portability, and differs primarily from D8x0 series in screen size. All are two spindle designs, with a \"D-bay\" modular bay which can interchange optical drives, a second hard drive, floppy disk or a second battery. All models have a smart card socket, PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a \"D-dock\" port for docking station or port replicator, and have an internal socket for an 802.11 wireless card.\n\nThe D600 and D610 share a common form factor, battery socket, and have a parallel printer port.\n\nThe D620 and D630 share a common form factor, battery socket, and do not have a parallel printer port. Both have support for an optional internal Bluetooth module, a socket for an optional mobile broadband card, and have an external switch for disabling any wireless connections.\n\n====Latitude D600====\nThe D600 (and simultaneously introduced D800) was released on 3/12/2003. These were Dell's first business-oriented notebooks based on the [[Pentium M|Pentium-M]] processor. The Latitude D600 series used the first-generation \"Banias\" or Dothan Pentium M chips running on a 400 MT/s FSB on DDR memory. It had a PATA hard drive and a D-series modular bay, and used an ATI Radeon 9000 GPU. It had a 14\" screen, in regular (non-widescreen) form factor. Unlike later D6x0 series machines, both memory sockets were accessible from a single cover on the bottom of the system.\n\nMost, if not all Latitude models prior to the Latitude Dx20 series had a near-clone Inspiron, in the case of the D600, it was the Inspiron 600M. Differences include that the 600M does not work with the Dell D-Dock, and the case styling is slightly different. The motherboards, screens and hard drive caddies are all physically interchangeable.\n\nThe Latitude D600 used a PA-10/PA-12 charger and came with a DVD drive, 2 x USB, 1 x TV, 1 x network, 1 x parallel, 1 x serial and 1 monitor output. The hard drive is accessible through a cover on the left hand front side of the lower case and is secured by 1 screw. After removing the screw, the hard drive can then slide out.\n\n====Latitude D610====\nThe D610 (released in 2005) was an update of the D600 design; it used a slightly modified D600 chassis and a newer [[Pentium M]] chipset (\"Sonoma\" with 533 MT/s FSB). This chipset was the first Intel mobile chipset to use DDR2 Memory, versus the DDR in the Latitude Dx00 series. For space saving purposes, instead of having both RAM chips on the bottom of the laptop, one RAM slot was moved to the top of the motherboard which could be accessed by removing the keyboard, whereas the other RAM slot remained in the area it had been located at previously. Unlike the D600 and prior midrange Latitudes (The 6xx series, dating back to the C-series) you had a choice of standard integrated Intel Graphics (GMA 900), or a discrete ATI solution (Radeon X300).\n\n=====Latitude D610 Audio-Out \"whining\"=====\nSome Dell Latitude D610 units with a dedicated ATI X300 graphics card seem to have problems with the audio-out jack. Symptoms of this problem include a noise or whine when an audio device is connected to the audio-out jack. Up to this date Dell does not have a clear solution to this problem.<ref name=\"support.dell.com\">{{cite web|url=http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&cs=19&dl=false&l=en&s=dhs&docid=F3787DCCC033918BE030030ABB627371&doclang=en|title=Support Library \u2013Dell US|first=Dell|last=US|website=support.dell.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neilslade.com/DellLatitudeAudioBuzzNoiseUSB.html|title=Dell Latitude D610 AUDIO BUZZ HIGH PITCHED NOISE USB DEVICE Problem and MISSING DRIVERS|first=Neil|last=Slade|date=|website=www.neilslade.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2472|title=Dell Latitude D610 Review (pics, specs)|website=www.notebookreview.com}}</ref><ref>http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-latitude-d610/1996-3121_7-31268759.html?ctype=msgid&messageSiteID=7&messageID=1010532&cval=1010532{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Latitude D620====\nIn March 2006, Dell introduced the D620 (and the D820), its first business-oriented notebook with a dual core processor available. The D620 marked the transition from strictly 32-bit processing to opening-up the potential to run 64-bit operating-systems and applications.  Initially available with the interim \"[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]\" Core Duo ([[x86]] 32-bit) processors, it was later sold with the first-generation mobile \"[[Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]]\" Core 2 ([[x86-64]] 64-bit) processor once those became available from Intel in the Fall of 2006; both run on a 667MT/s bus. So depending on the installed processor, a D620 can run x86-64 64-bit software. The D620 used a [[Socket M|Socket-M]] for its motherboard and its CPU is possible to be upgraded. It was initially sold with Intel integrated graphics, but an option to upgrade to a discrete Nvidia GPU became available after a few months. It replaced the raised pointing stick with a \"low profile\" model, and introduced the option of 4-cell and 9-cell batteries in addition to the standard 6-cell model. It uses DDR2 memory and is compatible with both PC2-4200 (533&nbsp;MHz) and PC2-5300 (667&nbsp;MHz) memory.\n\nAlthough the D620 accepts a maximum of 4 GB of physical memory, it cannot be used fully, because of the 32-bit physical addressing limitation of the 945 [[List of Intel chipsets#Core/Core 2 mobile chipsets|Core 2 mobile chipsets]] [Intel-945GM/PM-chipset], (not related to the BIOS or the use of a 32-bit or 64-bit OS), restricts the usable memory by the operating system to 3.5 GB, or 3.3 GB with on board video (memory is shared).\n\nThe D620 has one mono speaker located in the base below the touchpad. It has no option to expand to stereo without using external speakers or headphones.\n\nThere was no near-clone Inspiron model for the D620.\n\n=====Latitude D620 problems=====\nAll early D620 models were known for faulty LCD screens. The early models suffered from light bleeding, where a black screen would show light bleeding in from the bottom of the screen. This wasn't fixed until almost a year into production. In addition, some D630 screens are known for having bad LCD pixels.\nThe D620/D630 and D820/D830 were available with an Intel integrated GMA or Nvidia graphics chip. Most Nvidia models will suffer from early failure of the graphics chip due to the switch to lead-free solder and \"underfill\" of the [[Ball grid array|BGA]]. The computer industry at the time had just switched to lead free solders without redesigning cooling systems. This in turn led to undesirable heating cycles of the more brittle solder causing micro fractures to quickly form. NVIDIA was found liable for these failures, causing a multimillion-unit recall, not only of some Dell notebooks, but also some HP, Compaq, and Apple products.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720221736/http://www.nvidiasettlement.com/pdfs/NVF_NOT.pdf Affected models]</ref> The failure manifests itself by stripes or \"artifacts\" on the LCD AND also an external screen or by the total absence of an image.\n\nDell tried to prolong the lifetime of the Nvidia chips with a BIOS update which causes the fan to run more continuously and thus reduce the strain from repeated heating/cooling cycles on the graphics chip.\n\nThey also have bad overheating problems.\n\n====Latitude D630====\nReleased in 2007 the D630 is an update of the D620 design. It differed most significantly in being based on the newer \"Santa Rosa\" (mobile 965) chipset, which supported the 800MT/s models of the mobile Core 2 Duo (both the Merom 7xx0 series and later the Penryn-based 8x00/9x00 series.) It also had newer versions of the graphics processor options, support for Intel's \"Turbo Memory\" flash cache (although this uses the same card slot as the mobile broadband card), and support for internal Wireless-N. It also added a 4-pin Firewire [[IEEE1394]] port. It uses DDR2 memory and is compatible with PC2-5300 (667&nbsp;MHz), and PC2-6400 (800&nbsp;MHz) memory will work at PC2-5300 speeds.\n\nThe optional nVidia graphics on this series of laptop are to be avoided due to overheating issues where the GPU would develop cracks in the solder. This was mostly due to temperature fluctuation but the graphics chips also ran much hotter than they were meant to. The D830 series, despite having more room for cooling the chip, suffered from the same issue.\n\nThe D630 unofficially will accept a maximum of 8&nbsp;GB of physical memory, however, a BIOS update is required.\n\nUnlike the D830, the D630 only has one speaker.\n\n====Latitude D630c====\nThe D630c was a slight variant model of the D630, featuring a \"manageable\" version of the motherboard chipset unavailable on the standard D630.\n\nUnlike the D630, the D630c model laptop could not be ordered with Intel graphics, it shipped only with the nVidia graphics chip. As a result, all of the Latitude D630c laptops will eventually fail if used, that is, unless they have already failed previously.\n\nIt also could only be ordered with the Intel 4965AGN wireless card, you couldn't order it with Dell's wireless options or lower end Intel wireless cards.\n\n====Latitude D631====\nThe Latitude D631 (released in 2007), similar to the D531, was a variant of the Latitude Dx30 series that had AMD processors instead of Intel. However, it is very rare inside the United States due to it not being an option to order on Dell's website. You can find some that originated in the United States, but those were special ordered over the phone. They were sold alongside the D630 as standard equipment in select international countries, but while not being that rare internationally, they didn't sell as many units as the D630 series (And even D630c series) laptops did. As a result, not much information about specific chipsets, graphics chip options (If there were any), or any other features can be found online for specifying details.\n\n===Latitude D8x0 series===\nThe Latitude D8x0 series is the 15.4\" corporate model; unlike the D600 and D610, all feature a widescreen form factor. All are two spindle designs, with a \"D-bay\" modular bay which can interchange optical drives, a floppy module, a second hard drive, or a second battery. All models have a smart card socket, PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a \"D-dock\" port for docking station or port replicator, and have an internal socket for an 802.11 wireless card.\n\n[[File:Dell Latitude D820 1.jpg|thumb|A Dell Latitude D820 running [[Windows 7#Editions|Windows 7 Professional]].]]\n\nThe D800 was Dell's first widescreen Latitude notebook.\n\nThe D8x0 series models roughly parallel the technology in the D6x0 models other than for screen size; they do not share a battery form factor with the D6x0 series. The D820 and D830 add an ExpressCard socket, not available in the D6x0 series. The D830 is capable of accepting 8&nbsp;GB of physical memory with updated firmware.\n\nThe D800 equated to the Precision M60, and the D810 to the Precision M70. They were for all intents and purposes identical except for the graphics card, certification and in the case of the M70, the lid.\n\nThe near-clone Inspirons for the D800 and D810 were the Inspiron 8500 and 8600; the D820 and D830 share hardware with Precision models M65 and M4300 respectively. There are even known cases of \"mixed-mode\" samples of the latter, where the Dell-recorded type according to the service tag and markings differs from the BIOS-reported type with an identical service tag.\n\nBoth Latitude D820 and D830 have stereo speakers mounted on both sides of the keyboard.\n\n===Latitude D5x0 series===\nThe Latitude D500 series is a set of \"entry level\" business models; they are built on a 15\" non-widescreen form factor, although models before the D530 were sold with both 14.1\" and 15\" screens (the 14.1\" having a wider [[bezel (screen)|bezel]].) They are 2-spindle devices (removable optical drive interchangeable with D6xx/D8xx machines), and roughly follow the technical generations (chipset and processor-wise) of the D6x0 and D8x0 series. The D530 was Dell's last non-widescreen Latitude model.\n\nThe Latitude D531 was also available, being the cheapest Latitude available at the time due to using AMD processors and cutting back on a few features. It was essentially a D830 with no PC Card slot, no trackpoint, an option for a 14\" screen (If this was chosen it would have a similar wider bezel as on the earlier D5xx series machines), an AMD-based motherboard. DVD Drives, Screen Assemblies (If the laptop was ordered with the 15\" screen), RAM, and Hard Drives/Caddies were interchangeable.\n\n===Latitude D4x0 series===\n[[File:Dell Latitude D410 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.jpeg|thumb|Dell Latitude D410 running [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]]]\n\nThe D400 and D410 were 12\" non-widescreen (4:3 aspect ratio) ultra-portable notebooks, roughly following the technology of the comparable generations of the series. The D400 had a design that was similar to the D610 and came with a ULV Pentium M (Banias). The D410 came with a ULV Pentium M (Dothan).\n\nThe D420 and D430 are 12.1\" widescreen ultra-portable notebooks. The D420 came with either an [[Intel Core Solo]] U1300 ULV 1.06&nbsp;GHz, [[Intel Core Duo]] U2400 ULV 1.06&nbsp;GHz or Intel Core Duo U2500 ULV 1.2&nbsp;GHz. Unlike its bigger D620 brother, the D420's CPU was a soldered-in [[Ball grid array|BGA]] and therefore is not up-gradable. The D430 came with either an Intel Core Solo U1400 ULV 1.2&nbsp;GHz or Intel Core 2 Duo U7600 1.2&nbsp;GHz; the U7700 Processor (1.33&nbsp;GHz) was later made available as an option.\n\n[[File:Dell Latitude D400 & D410.jpg|thumb|A Dell Latitude D400 running [[Linux Mint]] and a D410 running [[Windows XP]].]]\n\nWhile the D8x0, D6x0 and D5x0 models were all introduced simultaneously with each generation, the D4x0 series were generally introduced a couple of months after their counterparts. Also, since they use ULV (ultra-low-voltage) processors and chipsets, and are generally less powerful, the technology does not correspond as closely as it does between other models in each generation&nbsp;\u2014 for example, the D420 uses the [[parallel ATA]] hard drive (1.8\") rather than the SATA (2.5\") interface in the D520/620/820.\n\nIn a 22C\u00b0 ambient the D430 U7700 processor has been measured to run from 62C\u00b0 at idle to 85C\u00b0 under heavy system loads, that is, within 10C\u00b0 of Intel's max. temperature rating for the processor.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The D4x0 series has been replaced by the E4200 model.\n\n===Latitude C series===\nThe Latitude C-series notebooks covered the range of processors from the Pentium 166&nbsp;MHz to the Pentium 4-M. Models in this series included the CP (Pentium processors), CPi (Pentium II processors), CPx, C600 and C800 (Mobile Pentium III processors), CPt, C500 and C510 (Celeron processors), C400, C610 and C810 (Pentium 3-M processors) and C640 and C840 (Mobile Pentium 4-M).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/manuals?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&~ck=anavml|title=Manuals \u2013Dell US|first=Dell|last=US|date=|website=support.dell.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Latitude C500.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Latitude C500]]\n\nC series laptops were notable for their consistent and interchangeable accessories across this wide range of processors. The series was one of the first to offer the UXGA 1600x1200 resolution display and included a NVidia GeForce MX400 32&nbsp;MB video accelerator to complement the display requirements. A robust design made it a favorite in harsher climates; however, this design lacked the visual appeal of many of its competitors.<ref name=\"zdnet.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/reviews/hardware/laptops/soa/Dell-Latitude-C840-Powerful-and-ugly/0,2000065761,120265151,00.htm|title=Latest Topics \u2013ZDNet|author=|date=|website=ZDNet}}</ref>\n\nThe most popular of the C-series included the C800, C810, C840, and later the C640.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe later C-series models mostly had near clones sold as the Inspiron 4000 and 8000 series:\n* C840 cloned as the Inspiron 8200 and Precision M50\n* C810 cloned as the Inspiron 8100 and Precision M40\n* C800 cloned as the Inspiron 8000\n* C640 cloned as the Inspiron 4150 and as the Inspiron 2650\n* C610 cloned as the Inspiron 4100\n* C600 cloned as the Inspiron 4000\n* CPxJ cloned as the Inspiron 3800\n* CPxH cloned as the Inspiron 3700\n\nAn interesting note on the C840 is that it was the last Dell notebook (along with its sister models the Inspiron 8200 and Precision M50) to have both a \"fixed\" optical drive as well as a modular bay, making it a \"three-spindle\" notebook. The modular bay could also be used for a second battery identical to the primary battery rather than a special modular bay battery. It used a Pentium 4-M processor and DDR SDRAM.<ref name=\"zdnet.com.au\"/>\nThe Dell C840 can support up to one gigabyte of RAM in each of two slots, for a total of two gigabytes in all. The GPU can also be upgraded on the C840/M50/i8200, from a GeForce2 Go to the Quadro4 Go 700 from the Precision M50.\n\n===Other models===\nThe Latitude ATG was a semi-rugged version of the D620, and was Dell's only semi-rugged offering, while their fully rugged offering originally consisted of the Augmentix XTG630, a D630 in a fully rugged case, and later the D630 XFR. The ATG as well as the XFR have a protective glass glued on top of the screen that often has glue leaking onto the display causing air bubbles to form.\n\n=== Latitude XT ===\nThe Latitude XT was a touch-screen convertible-tablet computer.\n\n===Latitude XT problems===\nIn July 2008, Dell released [[multi-touch]] touch-screen drivers for the Latitude XT Tablet, claiming the \"industry's first convertible tablet with multi-touch capabilities.\"[11] Dell has partnered with [[N-trig]], providers of DuoSense technology, combining pen, capacitive touch and multi-touch in a single device. N-trig's DuoSense dual-mode digitizer uses both pen and zero-pressure capacitive touch to provide a true hands-on computing experience for mobile computers and other digital input products over a single device.\n\nA large number of user reports suggest that the Dell Latitude XT suffers from a major problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/10/20/multi-touch-giving-dell-latitude-xt-users-fits/|title=Multi-touch display giving Dell Latitude XT users fits?|author=|date=|website=engadget.com}}</ref> The N-Trig digitizer interfaces to the XT by an internal USB port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zproxy.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/n-trig-failure-to-open-device/|title=n-trig: Failure to open Device|author=|date=8 October 2008|website=wordpress.com}}</ref> Users report that any other USB device which is plugged in may, and usually does, prevent the N-Trig applet (program which controls the features) from identifying the N-Trig hardware. In addition, there have been reports that certain other drivers, such as iTunes Helper, may cause this or a similar problem. Other users report no problems from iTunes. According to the reports, this still leaves the dual sense but without Multi-Touch and other advanced features, \"which render the auto and dual mode useless. The digitizer will only start working again after consecutive reboots.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/dell_latitude_xt_multitouch_screen_has_digitizer_issues|title=PC gaming hardware \u2013PC Gamer|author=|date=|website=maximumpc.com}}</ref> There have also been reports that the driver may crash, catastrophically or non-catastrophically, leaving no screen input at all. A re-boot may solve the problem, but often users found that the driver installation is damaged, requiring a re-installation of the drivers. But the install program will not un-install if it doesn't recognize the N-Trig hardware. In this case, the alternatives are (1) restore the entire operating system from backup, (2) manually un-install by erasing all N-Trig programs and drivers then editing the registry to remove all references to N-Trig, then re-install the N-Trig software, or (3) do a complete re-install of Windows.\n\nThese problems have been reported both with XP and Vista, 32 and 64 bit. In addition, Dell sells a MediaBase with an internal DVD drive. The drive also interfaces by way of a USB connection inside the MediaBase. Most, but not all, users of the MediaBase report that it prevents the drivers from loading.\n\n===NVidia GPU problems===\nMany D620/D630 and D820/D830 models (and related [[Dell Precision|Precision]] models) with NVidia mobile GPUs may experience [[GeForce 8 Series#GeForce 8M Series|graphics failure]]. A Class Action Lawsuit settlement by NVidia was reached where certain Dell models were provided with replacement motherboards at no expense.\n\n===Recall affecting D Series batteries===\nDell posted notices to many of their laptop customers on August 14, 2006, saying that the Sony batteries on the D410, D500, D505, D510, D520, D600/D610, D620, and D800/D810 models were prone to bursting into flames, or even exploding.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/node/7807419|title=Too hot to handle|author=|date=2006-08-17|journal=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905234726/http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 |archivedate=2007-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe batteries on any of these computers purchased between April 2004 and July 18, 2006 were supposed to be removed and the computers run on AC power until replacements arrived.

The Latitude competes with the [[ThinkPad]] series from [[Lenovo]] (formerly IBM), the [[HP EliteBook|EliteBook]] series from [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Acer TravelMate|Travelmate]] series from [[Acer Inc.|Acer]]. The \"Rugged (Extreme)\", \"XFR\" and \"ATG\" models compete primarily with [[Panasonic]]'s [[Toughbook]] line of rugged computers.\n\n==Overview and product type==\n\nThe Dell Latitude is a laptop family from Dell Computers, intended for business use. By contrast, the [[Dell Inspiron]] is aimed at the consumer market and its specifications change regularly. Whereas Inspiron may change vendors or components several times over the course of a single model, the Latitude line generally retains identical components throughout its production. This design is intended to simplify maintenance and support tasks for large corporations, allowing components to be easily swapped between models.\n[[File:D630.jpg|thumb|Dell Latitude D630]]\n\nThe Dell Latitude series have dropped the initial alphabet in newer model types (as in Latitude 7480 whose predecessor was E7470), and became the successor to the popular Latitude E, D, C, and X series. The Latitudes from the early 1990s up until the C*00 lines weren't in a set \"series\", instead going under the models CP and XP with modifiers at the end, e.g.: XPi, CP M233.\n\nIn the past, the \"mainstream\" line was the 6 series, being the C6x0, D6x0, and E64x0 lines, but as of 2015 this line has been discontinued and replaced by both the 5 series and the 7 series. The 15\" \"Premium\" line was the 8 series, until the E-series merged this line with the 6 series (Model numbers being along the lines of C8x0 or D8x0). The \"budget\" line was the 5 series, but as of 2015 the 5 series and 7 series Latitude laptops are the primary lines of Latitude laptops. The 3 series has replaced the 5 series as the budget line. Dell has also since dropped the E from the Latitude line (due to switching to a USB C/Thunderbolt dock system, rather than the e-Port analog pin-system docks), and the models are delineated by number now, e.g.: Latitude 5480, 5570. The second number in the model (As in, 5'''4'''70 or 7'''2'''80) indicates the size of the screen in the laptop.\n\nThe current Dell Latitude lineup is as follows:\n\nLatitude 3xxx series. Budget models intended for education or home office environments, available in 13.3\"/14\"/15.6\" trims.\n\nLatitude 5xxx series. Mainstream line, available in 11.1\"/12.5\"/13.3\"/14\"/15.6\" trims.\n\nLatitude 7xxx series. Premium \"ultrabooks\", available in 12.5\"/13.3\"/14\" trims only.\n\nLatitude computers are also differentiated in their feature sets, due to their business focus. For example, they often include security features such as smartcard and contactless smartcard, and TPM security, which are not needed by most consumers. A lid clasp (as opposed to a magnetic latching system), DisplayPort video out (as opposed to HDMI), and support for legacy standards are all results of the requirements of the business market.\n\nSome models also have the capability of [[Latitude ON]] which can be selected during the configuration of the laptop. Latitude ON is essentially a system within a system. It requires a separate add on module which contains its own [[microprocessor]] and [[Operating system]]. This allows the laptop to function in the realm of a [[Netbook]].\n\n==Current models==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |'''Latitude''' 2010-2019\n|-\n!\n!Type\n!**00\n(2010)\n!**10\n(2011)\n!**20\n(2012)\n!**30\n(2013)\n!**40\n(2014)\n!**50\n(2015)\n!**70\n(2016)\n!**80\n(2017)\n!**90\n(2018)\n!**00\n(2019)\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" |Top-class\n|-\n|16\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Ultraportable ([[ultrabook]])\n| Z600\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |14\"\n! colspan=3 |\n|6430u\n|E7440\n|E7450\n|E7470\n|7480\n|7490\n|7400\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|7400 2-in-1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |13.3\"\n|E4300\n|E4310\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|7370\n|7380\n|7390\n|7300\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Convertible\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|7350\n!\n|7389\n|7390 2-in-1\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |12.5\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|7275\n|7285\n!\n|7200 2-in-1\n|-\n|Ultraportable ([[ultrabook]])\n|E4200\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|E7240\n|E7250\n|E7270\n|7280\n|7290\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" |Middle class\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |15.6\"\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Mainstream\n|E6500\n|E6510\n|E6520\n|E6530\n|E6540\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|E5540\n|E5550\n|E5570\n|5580\n|5590\n|5500\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|5591\n|5501\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |14\"\n|E6400\n|E6410\n|E6420\n|E6430\n|E6440\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|E5440\n|E5450\n|E5470\n|5480\n|5490\n|5400\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|5495\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|5491\n|5401\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |13.3\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|E6320\n|E6330\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|5300\n|-\n|2-in-1\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|XT3\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|5300 2-in-1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |12.5\"\n|Mainstream\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|E6220\n|E6230\n!\n|E5250\n|E5270\n|5280\n|5290\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2-in-1\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|5285\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|5289\n|5290 2-in-1\n!\n|-\n|10.8\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|5175/9\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|10.1\"\n|Tablet\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" |10-ST2\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" |Entry-level\n|-\n|15.6\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Mainstream\n|E5500\n|E5510\n|E5520\n|E5530\n|E3540\n|E3550\n|3570\n|3580\n|3590\n|3500\n|-\n|14\"\n|E5400\n|E5410\n|E5420\n|E5430\n|E3440\n|E3450\n|3470\n|3480\n|3490\n|3400\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |13.3\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|3380\n!\n|3301\n|-\n|Entry (educational)\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|3300\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2-in-1\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|3379\n!\n|3390 2-in-1\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |11.6\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|3189\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Netbook]]\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|3150\n|3160\n|3180\n|3190\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10.1\"\n|2100\n|2110\n|2120\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|-\n|Tablet\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|10-ST2e\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|}\n(List does not include rugged modifications).\n\n[[File:IMG-20110304-00151.jpg|thumb|200px|right|RFID (Optional) location on a Latitude E6410]]\n\nDell used the \"E-series\" name up through the 2016 models, and new 2017 models drop the \"E.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Latitude E7470|url=http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e7470-ultrabook/pd|website=Dell|publisher=Dell|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Latitude 7480|url=http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-14-7480-laptop/pd|website=Dell|publisher=Dell|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref> and Dell E-Port Replicator with it. As of February 2017, Latitude computers are available in three series: the 3000, 5000, and 7000. The 3000 series is designed to be entry-level, similar to the previous Latitude E55xx and Latitude E54xx laptops. The 5000 series is mid-range, similar to the Latitude E64xx and E65xx. It includes a high performance subseries whose model designations end in 1. These devices are available with [[thermal design power|higher-TDP]] processors, [[video card|discrete graphics]] and [[NVM Express|NVMe]] [[Solid-state drive|SSD]]s. The 7000 series consists of high-end [[Ultrabook]] computers, introduced in 2014 with the Latitude E7440 and E7240.\n\nAside from the 3000, 5000, and 7000 series, Dell also provides an Education and Rugged Series of Latitude computers. The Education series laptops are designed for use in educational institutions. They're not especially powerful, and are more geared towards office applications or internet-based applications. The Rugged series laptops are similar to the previous Latitude XFR computers. They are designed with extra durability in mind.\n\n=== xx10 Models (2020) ===\n* '''9510 2-in-1''': 15.0\" lightweight

Dx30 revision. The models are the D4x0 (12.1\" Ultra Mobile), D5x0 (14.1 or 15.0\" standard aspect screen except for D531, plastic case, value model), D6x0 (14.1\" Corporate model) and D8x0 (15.4\" high-resolution model) most models are based on the Intel [[Core 2 Duo]] and the Intel Santa Rosa chipset, with the exception being the D531. Ever since the D420, D620, and D800, the D-series features wide aspect LCD screens: 12.1\", 14.1\", and 15.4\" respectively.\n\n===Latitude D6x0 series===\nThe Latitude D6x0 series is the 14\"/14.1\" corporate model. It aims to combine heavy-duty power with reasonable portability, and differs primarily from D8x0 series in screen size. All are two spindle designs, with a \"D-bay\" modular bay which can interchange optical drives, a second hard drive, floppy disk or a second battery. All models have a smart card socket, PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a \"D-dock\" port for docking station or port replicator, and have an internal socket for an 802.11 wireless card.\n\nThe D600 and D610 share a common form factor, battery socket, and have a parallel printer port.\n\nThe D620 and D630 share a common form factor, battery socket, and do not have a parallel printer port. Both have support for an optional internal Bluetooth module, a socket for an optional mobile broadband card, and have an external switch for disabling any wireless connections.\n\n====Latitude D600====\nThe D600 (and simultaneously introduced D800) was released on 3/12/2003. These were Dell's first business-oriented notebooks based on the [[Pentium M|Pentium-M]] processor. The Latitude D600 series used the first-generation \"Banias\" or Dothan Pentium M chips running on a 400 MT/s FSB on DDR memory. It had a PATA hard drive and a D-series modular bay, and used an ATI Radeon 9000 GPU. It had a 14\" screen, in regular (non-widescreen) form factor. Unlike later D6x0 series machines, both memory sockets were accessible from a single cover on the bottom of the system.\n\nMost, if not all Latitude models prior to the Latitude Dx20 series had a near-clone Inspiron, in the case of the D600, it was the Inspiron 600M. Differences include that the 600M does not work with the Dell D-Dock, and the case styling is slightly different. The motherboards, screens and hard drive caddies are all physically interchangeable.\n\nThe Latitude D600 used a PA-10/PA-12 charger and came with a DVD drive, 2 x USB, 1 x TV, 1 x network, 1 x parallel, 1 x serial and 1 monitor output. The hard drive is accessible through a cover on the left hand front side of the lower case and is secured by 1 screw. After removing the screw, the hard drive can then slide out.\n\n====Latitude D610====\nThe D610 (released in 2005) was an update of the D600 design; it used a slightly modified D600 chassis and a newer [[Pentium M]] chipset (\"Sonoma\" with 533 MT/s FSB). This chipset was the first Intel mobile chipset to use DDR2 Memory, versus the DDR in the Latitude Dx00 series. For space saving purposes, instead of having both RAM chips on the bottom of the laptop, one RAM slot was moved to the top of the motherboard which could be accessed by removing the keyboard, whereas the other RAM slot remained in the area it had been located at previously. Unlike the D600 and prior midrange Latitudes (The 6xx series, dating back to the C-series) you had a choice of standard integrated Intel Graphics (GMA 900), or a discrete ATI solution (Radeon X300).\n\n=====Latitude D610 Audio-Out \"whining\"=====\nSome Dell Latitude D610 units with a dedicated ATI X300 graphics card seem to have problems with the audio-out jack. Symptoms of this problem include a noise or whine when an audio device is connected to the audio-out jack. Up to this date Dell does not have a clear solution to this problem.<ref name=\"support.dell.com\">{{cite web|url=http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&cs=19&dl=false&l=en&s=dhs&docid=F3787DCCC033918BE030030ABB627371&doclang=en|title=Support Library \u2013Dell US|first=Dell|last=US|website=support.dell.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neilslade.com/DellLatitudeAudioBuzzNoiseUSB.html|title=Dell Latitude D610 AUDIO BUZZ HIGH PITCHED NOISE USB DEVICE Problem and MISSING DRIVERS|first=Neil|last=Slade|date=|website=www.neilslade.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2472|title=Dell Latitude D610 Review (pics, specs)|website=www.notebookreview.com}}</ref><ref>http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-latitude-d610/1996-3121_7-31268759.html?ctype=msgid&messageSiteID=7&messageID=1010532&cval=1010532{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Latitude D620====\nIn March 2006, Dell introduced the D620 (and the D820), its first business-oriented notebook with a dual core processor available. The D620 marked the transition from strictly 32-bit processing to opening-up the potential to run 64-bit operating-systems and applications.  Initially available with the interim \"[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]\" Core Duo ([[x86]] 32-bit) processors, it was later sold with the first-generation mobile \"[[Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]]\" Core 2 ([[x86-64]] 64-bit) processor once those became available from Intel in the Fall of 2006; both run on a 667MT/s bus. So depending on the installed processor, a D620 can run x86-64 64-bit software. The D620 used a [[Socket M|Socket-M]] for its motherboard and its CPU is possible to be upgraded. It was initially sold with Intel integrated graphics, but an option to upgrade to a discrete Nvidia GPU became available after a few months. It replaced the raised pointing stick with a \"low profile\" model, and introduced the option of 4-cell and 9-cell batteries in addition to the standard 6-cell model. It uses DDR2 memory and is compatible with both PC2-4200 (533&nbsp;MHz) and PC2-5300 (667&nbsp;MHz) memory.\n\nAlthough the D620 accepts a maximum of 4 GB of physical memory, it cannot be used fully, because of the 32-bit physical addressing limitation of the 945 [[List of Intel chipsets#Core/Core 2 mobile chipsets|Core 2 mobile chipsets]] [Intel-945GM/PM-chipset], (not related to the BIOS or the use of a 32-bit or 64-bit OS), restricts the usable memory by the operating system to 3.5 GB, or 3.3 GB with on board video (memory is shared).\n\nThe D620 has one mono speaker located in the base below the touchpad. It has no option to expand to stereo without using external speakers or headphones.\n\nThere was no near-clone Inspiron model for the D620.\n\n=====Latitude D620 problems=====\nAll early D620 models were known for faulty LCD screens. The early models suffered from light bleeding, where a black screen would show light bleeding in from the bottom of the screen. This wasn't fixed until almost a year into production. In addition, some D630 screens are known for having bad LCD pixels.\nThe D620/D630 and D820/D830 were available with an Intel integrated GMA or Nvidia graphics chip. Most Nvidia models will suffer from early failure of the graphics chip due to the switch to lead-free solder and \"underfill\" of the [[Ball grid array|BGA]]. The computer industry at the time had just switched to lead free solders without redesigning cooling systems. This in turn led to undesirable heating cycles of the more brittle solder causing micro fractures to quickly form. NVIDIA was found liable for these failures, causing a multimillion-unit recall, not only of some Dell notebooks, but also some HP, Compaq, and Apple products.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720221736/http://www.nvidiasettlement.com/pdfs/NVF_NOT.pdf Affected models]</ref> The failure manifests itself by stripes or \"artifacts\" on the LCD AND also an external screen or by the total absence of an image.\n\nDell tried to prolong the lifetime of the Nvidia chips with a BIOS update which causes the fan to run more continuously and thus reduce the strain from repeated heating/cooling cycles on the graphics chip.\n\nThey also have bad overheating problems.\n\n====Latitude D630====\nReleased in 2007 the D630 is an update of the D620 design. It differed most significantly in being based on the newer \"Santa Rosa\" (mobile 965) chipset, which supported the 800MT/s models of the mobile Core 2 Duo (both the Merom 7xx0 series and later the Penryn-based 8x00/9x00 series.) It also had newer versions of the graphics processor options, support for Intel's \"Turbo Memory\" flash cache (although this uses the same card slot as the mobile broadband card), and support for internal Wireless-N. It also added a 4-pin Firewire [[IEEE1394]] port. It uses DDR2 memory and is compatible with PC2-5300 (667&nbsp;MHz), and PC2-6400 (800&nbsp;MHz) memory will work at PC2-5300 speeds.\n\nThe optional nVidia graphics on this series of laptop are to be avoided due to overheating issues where the GPU would develop cracks in the solder. This was mostly due to temperature fluctuation but the graphics chips also ran much hotter than they were meant to. The D830 series, despite having more room for cooling the chip, suffered from the same issue.\n\nThe D630 unofficially will accept a maximum of 8&nbsp;GB of physical memory, however, a BIOS update is required.\n\nUnlike the D830, the D630 only has one speaker.\n\n====Latitude D630c====\nThe D630c was a slight variant model of the D630, featuring a \"manageable\" version of the motherboard chipset unavailable on the standard D630.\n\nUnlike the D630, the D630c model laptop could not be ordered with Intel graphics, it shipped only with the nVidia graphics chip. As a result, all of the Latitude D630c laptops will eventually fail if used, that is, unless they have already failed previously.\n\nIt also could only be ordered with the Intel 4965AGN wireless card, you couldn't order it with Dell's wireless options or lower end Intel wireless cards.\n\n====Latitude D631====\nThe Latitude D631 (released in 2007), similar to the D531, was a variant of the Latitude Dx30 series that had AMD processors instead of Intel. However, it is very rare inside the United States due to it not being an option to order on Dell's website. You can find some that originated in the United States, but those were special ordered over the phone. They were sold alongside the D630 as standard equipment in select international countries, but while not being that rare internationally, they didn't sell as many units as the D630 series (And even D630c series) laptops did. As a result, not much information about specific chipsets, graphics chip options (If there were any), or any other features can be found online for specifying details.\n\n===Latitude D8x0 series===\nThe Latitude D8x0 series is the 15.4\" corporate model; unlike the D600 and D610, all feature a widescreen form factor. All are two spindle designs, with a \"D-bay\" modular bay which can interchange optical drives, a floppy module, a second hard drive, or a second battery. All models have a smart card socket, PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a \"D-dock\" port for docking station or port replicator, and have an internal socket for an 802.11 wireless card.\n\n[[File:Dell Latitude D820 1.jpg|thumb|A Dell Latitude D820 running [[Windows 7#Editions|Windows 7 Professional]].]]\n\nThe D800 was Dell's first widescreen Latitude notebook.\n\nThe D8x0 series models roughly parallel the technology in the D6x0 models other than for screen size; they do not share a battery form factor with the D6x0 series. The D820 and D830 add an ExpressCard socket, not available in the D6x0 series. The D830 is capable of accepting 8&nbsp;GB of physical memory with updated firmware.\n\nThe D800 equated to the Precision M60, and the D810 to the Precision M70. They were for all intents and purposes identical except for the graphics card, certification and in the case of the M70, the lid.\n\nThe near-clone Inspirons for the D800 and D810 were the Inspiron 8500 and 8600; the D820 and D830 share hardware with Precision models M65 and M4300 respectively. There are even known cases of \"mixed-mode\" samples of the latter, where the Dell-recorded type according to the service tag and markings differs from the BIOS-reported type with an identical service tag.\n\nBoth Latitude D820 and D830 have stereo speakers mounted on both sides of the keyboard.\n\n===Latitude D5x0 series===\nThe Latitude D500 series is a set of \"entry level\" business models; they are built on a 15\" non-widescreen form factor, although models before the D530 were sold with both 14.1\" and 15\" screens (the 14.1\" having a wider [[bezel (screen)|bezel]].) They are 2-spindle devices (removable optical drive interchangeable with D6xx/D8xx machines), and roughly follow the technical generations (chipset and processor-wise) of the D6x0 and D8x0 series. The D530 was Dell's last non-widescreen Latitude model.\n\nThe Latitude D531 was also available, being the cheapest Latitude available at the time due to using AMD processors and cutting back on a few features. It was essentially a D830 with no PC Card slot, no trackpoint, an option for a 14\" screen (If this was chosen it would have a similar wider bezel as on the earlier D5xx series machines), an AMD-based motherboard. DVD Drives, Screen Assemblies (If the laptop was ordered with the 15\" screen), RAM, and Hard Drives/Caddies were interchangeable.\n\n===Latitude D4x0 series===\n[[File:Dell Latitude D410 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.jpeg|thumb|Dell Latitude D410 running [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]]]\n\nThe D400 and D410 were 12\" non-widescreen (4:3 aspect ratio) ultra-portable notebooks, roughly following the technology of the comparable generations of the series. The D400 had a design that was similar to the D610 and came with a ULV Pentium M (Banias). The D410 came with a ULV Pentium M (Dothan).\n\nThe D420 and D430 are 12.1\" widescreen ultra-portable notebooks. The D420 came with either an [[Intel Core Solo]] U1300 ULV 1.06&nbsp;GHz, [[Intel Core Duo]] U2400 ULV 1.06&nbsp;GHz or Intel Core Duo U2500 ULV 1.2&nbsp;GHz. Unlike its bigger D620 brother, the D420's CPU was a soldered-in [[Ball grid array|BGA]] and therefore is not up-gradable. The D430 came with either an Intel Core Solo U1400 ULV 1.2&nbsp;GHz or Intel Core 2 Duo U7600 1.2&nbsp;GHz; the U7700 Processor (1.33&nbsp;GHz) was later made available as an option.\n\n[[File:Dell Latitude D400 & D410.jpg|thumb|A Dell Latitude D400 running [[Linux Mint]] and a D410 running [[Windows XP]].]]\n\nWhile the D8x0, D6x0 and D5x0 models were all introduced simultaneously with each generation, the D4x0 series were generally introduced a couple of months after their counterparts. Also, since they use ULV (ultra-low-voltage) processors and chipsets, and are generally less powerful, the technology does not correspond as closely as it does between other models in each generation&nbsp;\u2014 for example, the D420 uses the [[parallel ATA]] hard drive (1.8\") rather than the SATA (2.5\") interface in the D520/620/820.\n\nIn a 22C\u00b0 ambient the D430 U7700 processor has been measured to run from 62C\u00b0 at idle to 85C\u00b0 under heavy system loads, that is, within 10C\u00b0 of Intel's max. temperature rating for the processor.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The D4x0 series has been replaced by the E4200 model.\n\n===Latitude C series===\nThe Latitude C-series notebooks covered the range of processors from the Pentium 166&nbsp;MHz to the Pentium 4-M. Models in this series included the CP (Pentium processors), CPi (Pentium II processors), CPx, C600 and C800 (Mobile Pentium III processors), CPt, C500 and C510 (Celeron processors), C400, C610 and C810 (Pentium 3-M processors) and C640 and C840 (Mobile Pentium 4-M).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/manuals?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&~ck=anavml|title=Manuals \u2013Dell US|first=Dell|last=US|date=|website=support.dell.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Latitude C500.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Latitude C500]]\n\nC series laptops were notable for their consistent and interchangeable accessories across this wide range of processors. The series was one of the first to offer the UXGA 1600x1200 resolution display and included a NVidia GeForce MX400 32&nbsp;MB video accelerator to complement the display requirements. A robust design made it a favorite in harsher climates; however, this design lacked the visual appeal of many of its competitors.<ref name=\"zdnet.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/reviews/hardware/laptops/soa/Dell-Latitude-C840-Powerful-and-ugly/0,2000065761,120265151,00.htm|title=Latest Topics \u2013ZDNet|author=|date=|website=ZDNet}}</ref>\n\nThe most popular of the C-series included the C800, C810, C840, and later the C640.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe later C-series models mostly had near clones sold as the Inspiron 4000 and 8000 series:\n* C840 cloned as the Inspiron 8200 and Precision M50\n* C810 cloned as the Inspiron 8100 and Precision M40\n* C800 cloned as the Inspiron 8000\n* C640 cloned as the Inspiron 4150 and as the Inspiron 2650\n* C610 cloned as the Inspiron 4100\n* C600 cloned as the Inspiron 4000\n* CPxJ cloned as the Inspiron 3800\n* CPxH cloned as the Inspiron 3700\n\nAn interesting note on the C840 is that it was the last Dell notebook (along with its sister models the Inspiron 8200 and Precision M50) to have both a \"fixed\" optical drive as well as a modular bay, making it a \"three-spindle\" notebook. The modular bay could also be used for a second battery identical to the primary battery rather than a special modular bay battery. It used a Pentium 4-M processor and DDR SDRAM.<ref name=\"zdnet.com.au\"/>\nThe Dell C840 can support up to one gigabyte of RAM in each of two slots, for a total of two gigabytes in all. The GPU can also be upgraded on the C840/M50/i8200, from a GeForce2 Go to the Quadro4 Go 700 from the Precision M50.\n\n===Other models===\nThe Latitude ATG was a semi-rugged version of the D620, and was Dell's only semi-rugged offering, while their fully rugged offering originally consisted of the Augmentix XTG630, a D630 in a fully rugged case, and later the D630 XFR. The ATG as well as the XFR have a protective glass glued on top of the screen that often has glue leaking onto the display causing air bubbles to form.\n\n=== Latitude XT ===\nThe Latitude XT was a touch-screen convertible-tablet computer.\n\n===Latitude XT problems===\nIn July 2008, Dell released [[multi-touch]] touch-screen drivers for the Latitude XT Tablet, claiming the \"industry's first convertible tablet with multi-touch capabilities.\"[11] Dell has partnered with [[N-trig]], providers of DuoSense technology, combining pen, capacitive touch and multi-touch in a single device. N-trig's DuoSense dual-mode digitizer uses both pen and zero-pressure capacitive touch to provide a true hands-on computing experience for mobile computers and other digital input products over a single device.\n\nA large number of user reports suggest that the Dell Latitude XT suffers from a major problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/10/20/multi-touch-giving-dell-latitude-xt-users-fits/|title=Multi-touch display giving Dell Latitude XT users fits?|author=|date=|website=engadget.com}}</ref> The N-Trig digitizer interfaces to the XT by an internal USB port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zproxy.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/n-trig-failure-to-open-device/|title=n-trig: Failure to open Device|author=|date=8 October 2008|website=wordpress.com}}</ref> Users report that any other USB device which is plugged in may, and usually does, prevent the N-Trig applet (program which controls the features) from identifying the N-Trig hardware. In addition, there have been reports that certain other drivers, such as iTunes Helper, may cause this or a similar problem. Other users report no problems from iTunes. According to the reports, this still leaves the dual sense but without Multi-Touch and other advanced features, \"which render the auto and dual mode useless. The digitizer will only start working again after consecutive reboots.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/dell_latitude_xt_multitouch_screen_has_digitizer_issues|title=PC gaming hardware \u2013PC Gamer|author=|date=|website=maximumpc.com}}</ref> There have also been reports that the driver may crash, catastrophically or non-catastrophically, leaving no screen input at all. A re-boot may solve the problem, but often users found that the driver installation is damaged, requiring a re-installation of the drivers. But the install program will not un-install if it doesn't recognize the N-Trig hardware. In this case, the alternatives are (1) restore the entire operating system from backup, (2) manually un-install by erasing all N-Trig programs and drivers then editing the registry to remove all references to N-Trig, then re-install the N-Trig software, or (3) do a complete re-install of Windows.\n\nThese problems have been reported both with XP and Vista, 32 and 64 bit. In addition, Dell sells a MediaBase with an internal DVD drive. The drive also interfaces by way of a USB connection inside the MediaBase. Most, but not all, users of the MediaBase report that it prevents the drivers from loading.\n\n===NVidia GPU problems===\nMany D620/D630 and D820/D830 models (and related [[Dell Precision|Precision]] models) with NVidia mobile GPUs may experience [[GeForce 8 Series#GeForce 8M Series|graphics failure]]. A Class Action Lawsuit settlement by NVidia was reached where certain Dell models were provided with replacement motherboards at no expense.\n\n===Recall affecting D Series batteries===\nDell posted notices to many of their laptop customers on August 14, 2006, saying that the Sony batteries on the D410, D500, D505, D510, D520, D600/D610, D620, and D800/D810 models were prone to bursting into flames, or even exploding.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/node/7807419|title=Too hot to handle|author=|date=2006-08-17|journal=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905234726/http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 |archivedate=2007-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe batteries on any of these computers purchased between April 2004 and July 18, 2006 were supposed to be removed and the computers run on AC power until replacements arrived.

Crises are deemed to be negative changes in the [[security]], [[economic]], [[political]], [[societal]], or [[Environmental policy|environmental]] [[affair]]s, especially when they occur abruptly, with little or no [[Warning system|warning]]. More loosely, it is a term meaning \"a testing time\" or an \"[[emergency]] event\".\n\n[[File:War-of-the-worlds-tripod.jpg|thumb|The [[Alien (franchise)|alien]] invasion in [[War of the Worlds]] was a fictitious crisis]]\n\n== Definition ==\nCrisis is often linked to the concept of [[psychological stress]] and used to suggest a frightening or fraught experience. In general, crisis is the situation of a \"complex system\" (family, economy, society. Note that simple systems do not enter crises. We can speak about a crisis of moral values, an economical or political crisis, but not a motor crisis) when the system functions poorly (the system still functions, but does not break down), an immediate decision is necessary to stop the further disintegration of the system, but the causes of the dysfunction are not immediately identified (the causes are so many, or unknown, that it is impossible to take a rational, informed decision to reverse the situation).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bundy|first=J.|author2=Pfarrer, M.

J. (2003). Risk communication in a High Reliability Organization: APHIS PPQ's inclusion of risk in decision making. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Proquest Information and Learning.</ref> argues that \"crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained.\" Therefore the fourth defining quality is the need for change. If change is not needed, the event could more accurately be described as a failure.\n\nApart from natural crises that are inherently unpredictable (volcanic eruptions, tsunami etc.) most of the crises that we face are created by man. Hence the requirements of their being 'unexpected' depends upon man failing to note the onset of crisis conditions. Some of our inability to recognise crises before they become dangerous is due to denial and other psychological responses <ref>Mitroff.I. (2005) Why some companies emerge stronger and better from a crisis, p36</ref> that provide succour and protection for our emotions.\n\nA different set of reasons for failing to notice the onset of crises is that we allow ourselves to be 'tricked' into believing that we are doing something for reasons that are false. In other words, we are doing the wrong things for the right reasons. For example, we might believe that we are solving the threats of climate change by engaging in economic trading activity that has no real impact on the climate. Mitroff and Silvers <ref>Mitroff & Silvers, (2009) Dirty rotten strategies</ref> posit two reasons for these mistakes, which they classify as Type 3 (inadvertent) and Type 4 (deliberate) errors.\n\nThe effect of our inability to attend to the likely results of our actions can result in crisis.\n\nFrom this perspective we might usefully learn that failing to understand the real causes of our difficulties is likely to lead to repeated downstream 'blowback'. Where [[Nation state|states]] are concerned, Michael Brecher, based on [[Case study|case studies]] of the [[International Crisis Behavior]] (ICB) project, suggested a different way of defining crisis as conditions are perceptions held by the highest level [[Decision making|decision-makers]] of the actor concerned:<ref>Shlaim, Avi, ''The United States and the Berlin Blockade, 1948\u20131949: a study in crisis decision-making'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, p.5</ref>\n1. [[threat]] to basic values, with a [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] or subsequent\n2. high [[probability]] of involvement in [[combat|military hostilities]], and the awareness of\n3. finite time for response to the external value threat.\n\n===Chinese word for \"crisis\"===\n{{main|Chinese word for \"crisis\"}}\n<nowiki>It is frequently said in Western motivational speaking that the Chinese word for \"crisis\" is composed of two Chinese characters signifying \"danger\" and \"opportunity\" respectively. This is, however, considered by linguists to be a misperception. {{</nowiki>[[Template:Citation needed|Citation needed]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>\n\n==Political crisis==\n{{see also|Constitutional crisis}}\n{{category see also|Government crises}}\n\n== Economic ==\n{{main|Crisis (economic)|l1=Economic crisis|Financial crisis}}\nAn ''economic crisis'' is a sharp transition to a [[recession]]. See for example [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)]], [[South American economic crisis of 2002]], [[Economic crisis of Cameroon]].

In this case, the impact of humans' alteration of the [[ecosystem]] has led to widespread and/or long-lasting consequences. It can include the deaths of animals (including humans) and plant systems, or severe disruption of human life, possibly requiring migration.\n\n=== Natural disaster ===\n{{main|Natural disaster}}\n\nA ''natural disaster'' is the consequence of a '''natural [[hazard]]''' (e.g. [[volcanic eruption]], [[earthquake]], [[landslide]]) which moves from potential into an active phase, and as a result affects human activities.  Human vulnerability, exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate [[emergency management]], leads to financial, structural, and human losses.  The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster, their resilience.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=G. Bankoff, G. Frerks, D.

An endangered species is usually a taxonomic [[species]], but may be another [[evolutionary significant unit]]. The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) has classified 38 percent of the 44,837 species assessed by 2008 as threatened.<ref name = \"IUCN\">[http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/the_iucn_red_list_a_key_conservation_tool_factsheet_en.pdf Factsheet: The IUCN Red List a key conservation tool (2008)]</ref>\n\n== International ==\n{{main|International crisis|Crisis management}}\n\nFor information about crises in the field of study in [[international relations]], see [[crisis management]] and [[international crisis]]. In this context, a crisis can be loosely defined as a situation where there is a perception of threat, heightened anxiety, expectation of possible violence and the belief that any actions will have far-reaching consequences (Lebow, 7\u201310).\n\n== Personal ==\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_131.png|thumb|right|Messengers going to Job, each with bad news, 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nA personal crisis occurs when an individual can no longer cope with a situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\">Lanceley, F. J. (2003). On-Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators, Second Edition (2nd ed.). London: CRC Press.</ref> This is preceded by events of an extraordinary nature triggering extreme tension and stress within an individual, i.e., the crisis, which then requires major decisions or actions to resolve. Crises can be triggered by a wide range of situations including, but not limited to, [[extreme weather]] conditions, sudden change in employment/financial state, medical emergencies, long-term illness, and social or familial turmoil. Crises are simply a change in the events that comprise the day-to-day life of a person and those in their close circle, such as the loss of a job, extreme financial hardship, substance addiction/abuse and other situations that are life altering and require action that is outside the \"normal\" daily routine. A person going through a crisis experiences a state of mental disequilibrium, in which the ego struggles to balance both internal and external demands.<ref name=\"Woolley\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woolley | first1 = N | year = 1990 | title = Crisis theory: A paradigm of effective intervention with families of critically ill people | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 1402\u20131408 | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2648.1990.tb01782.x}}</ref> In this case, said person resorts to [[coping mechanism]]s to deal with the stress. Various coping mechanisms include:<ref name=\"NBPG\">Nursing Best Practice Guideline: Shaping the future of Nursing. (Electronic book). Appendix C - Assessment of coping skills and support systems. (Page 53). Executive Director: Doris Grispun, RN, MScN, PhD. Date: August 2002.</ref>\n* High emotions (crying, physical withdrawal)\n* Defence mechanisms (denial, repression)\n* Making rash decisions\n* Acting out\n* Putting things on hold\n\nIn some cases, it is difficult for an individual undergoing a crisis to adapt to the situation. As it is outside of their normal range of functioning, it is common that one endures a struggle to control emotions. This lack of control can lead to suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, trouble with the law and general avoidance of resources available for help. One such resource used to aid an individual in crisis is their social support system, which can come in the form of family, friends, coworkers, or health professionals. It is important that a support system consists of people that the individual trusts. Although these support systems play a crucial role in aiding an individual through a crisis, they are also the underlying cause of two thirds of mental health crises.<ref name=\"NBPG\"/> The aforementioned mental health crises can include marital issues, abandonment, parental conflict and family struggles.\n\nIn order to aid someone in a crisis, it is crucial to be able to identify the signs that indicate they are undergoing an internal conflict. These signs, as well as the aforementioned coping mechanisms, include:<ref name=\"Lancely\"/><ref>Vecchi, G. M. (2009). Conflict and crisis communication. Annals of the American Psychotherapy Association, 12(2), 32-29.</ref>\n* Irrational and/or narrow thinking\n* Lowered attention span\n* Unclear motives\n* Disorganized approach to problem solving\n* Resistance to communication\n* Inability to differ between large and small issues\n* Change/alteration to social networks\n\n===Ways to manage a crisis===\nAs aforementioned, a crisis to this day can be overcome by implementing mechanisms such as: [[sleep]], [[Social rejection|rejection]], physical [[exercise]], [[meditation]] and [[thinking]]. To assist individuals in regaining emotional equilibrium, intervention can be used. The overall goal of a crisis intervention is to get the individual back to a pre-crisis level of functioning or higher with the help of a social support group. As said by Judith Swan, there's a strong correlation between the client's emotional balance and the trust in their support system in helping them throughout their crisis.<ref>Swan, J., & Hamilton, P.M. (2014). Mental health crisis management. Wild Iris Medical Education, Inc.</ref> The steps of crisis intervention are: to assess the situation based on behaviour patterns of the individual, decide what type of help is needed (make a plan of action) and finally to take action/intervention, based on the individual's skills to regain equilibrium.<ref name=\"Woolley\"/>\n\nThe Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario proposed the ABC model for dealing with client's interventions in crises:<ref>Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario. (2006). Crisis intervention. Toronto, ON: Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario.</ref>\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n    |1=<!--A-->Basic attending skills (making the person comfortable, remaining calm, etc.)\n    |2=<!--B-->Identifying the problem and therapeutic interaction (explore their perceptions, identify sources of emotional distress, identify impairments in behavioural functioning, use therapeutic interactions)\n    |3=<!--C-->Coping (identify coping attempts, present alternative coping strategies, follow up post-crisis)\n}}\n\n===Benefits of listening in a crisis===\nMoreover, another method for helping individuals who are suffering in a crisis is active listening; it is defined as seeing circumstances from another perspective and letting the other person know that the negotiator (the helper) understands their perspective. Through this, they establish trust and rapport by demonstrating empathy, understanding and objectivity in a non-judgmental way. It is important for the negotiator to listen to verbal and non-verbal reactions of the person in need, in order to be able to label the emotion that the individual is showing. Thus, this demonstrates that the helper is tuned in emotionally. Furthermore, there are other techniques that can be used to demonstrate actively listening such as: paraphrasing, silence and reflecting or mirroring.

In general, crisis is the situation of a \"complex system\" (family, economy, society. Note that simple systems do not enter crises. We can speak about a crisis of moral values, an economical or political crisis, but not a motor crisis) when the system functions poorly (the system still functions, but does not break down), an immediate decision is necessary to stop the further disintegration of the system, but the causes of the dysfunction are not immediately identified (the causes are so many, or unknown, that it is impossible to take a rational, informed decision to reverse the situation).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bundy|first=J.|author2=Pfarrer, M.

J. (2003). Risk communication in a High Reliability Organization: APHIS PPQ's inclusion of risk in decision making. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Proquest Information and Learning.</ref> argues that \"crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained.\" Therefore the fourth defining quality is the need for change. If change is not needed, the event could more accurately be described as a failure.\n\nApart from natural crises that are inherently unpredictable (volcanic eruptions, tsunami etc.) most of the crises that we face are created by man. Hence the requirements of their being 'unexpected' depends upon man failing to note the onset of crisis conditions. Some of our inability to recognise crises before they become dangerous is due to denial and other psychological responses <ref>Mitroff.I. (2005) Why some companies emerge stronger and better from a crisis, p36</ref> that provide succour and protection for our emotions.\n\nA different set of reasons for failing to notice the onset of crises is that we allow ourselves to be 'tricked' into believing that we are doing something for reasons that are false. In other words, we are doing the wrong things for the right reasons. For example, we might believe that we are solving the threats of climate change by engaging in economic trading activity that has no real impact on the climate. Mitroff and Silvers <ref>Mitroff & Silvers, (2009) Dirty rotten strategies</ref> posit two reasons for these mistakes, which they classify as Type 3 (inadvertent) and Type 4 (deliberate) errors.\n\nThe effect of our inability to attend to the likely results of our actions can result in crisis.\n\nFrom this perspective we might usefully learn that failing to understand the real causes of our difficulties is likely to lead to repeated downstream 'blowback'. Where [[Nation state|states]] are concerned, Michael Brecher, based on [[Case study|case studies]] of the [[International Crisis Behavior]] (ICB) project, suggested a different way of defining crisis as conditions are perceptions held by the highest level [[Decision making|decision-makers]] of the actor concerned:<ref>Shlaim, Avi, ''The United States and the Berlin Blockade, 1948\u20131949: a study in crisis decision-making'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, p.5</ref>\n1. [[threat]] to basic values, with a [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] or subsequent\n2. high [[probability]] of involvement in [[combat|military hostilities]], and the awareness of\n3. finite time for response to the external value threat\n\n===Chinese word for \"crisis\"===\n{{main|Chinese word for \"crisis\"}}\n<nowiki>It is frequently said in Western motivational speaking that the Chinese word for \"crisis\" is composed of two Chinese characters signifying \"danger\" and \"opportunity\" respectively. This is, however, considered by linguists to be a misperception. {{</nowiki>[[Template:Citation needed|Citation needed]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>\n\n==Political crisis==\n{{see also|Constitutional crisis}}\n{{category see also|Government crises}}\n\n== Economic ==\n{{main|Crisis (economic)|l1=Economic crisis|Financial crisis}}\nAn ''economic crisis'' is a sharp transition to a [[recession]]. See for example [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)]], [[South American economic crisis of 2002]], [[Economic crisis of Cameroon]]. [[Crisis theory]] is a central achievement in the conclusions of [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of Capital.\n\nA [[financial crisis]] may be a [[banking crisis]] or [[currency crisis]].\n\n== Environmental ==\nCrises pertaining to the environment include:\n\n=== Environmental disaster ===\n{{main|Environmental disaster}}\n\nAn '''environmental disaster''' is a [[disaster]] that is due to human activity and should not be confused with [[natural disaster]]s ''([[#Natural disaster|see below]])''. In this case, the impact of humans' alteration of the [[ecosystem]] has led to widespread and/or long-lasting consequences. It can include the deaths of animals (including humans) and plant systems, or severe disruption of human life, possibly requiring migration.\n\n=== Natural disaster ===\n{{main|Natural disaster}}\n\nA ''natural disaster'' is the consequence of a '''natural [[hazard]]''' (e.g. [[volcanic eruption]], [[earthquake]], [[landslide]]) which moves from potential into an active phase, and as a result affects human activities.  Human vulnerability, exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate [[emergency management]], leads to financial, structural, and human losses.  The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster, their resilience.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=G. Bankoff, G. Frerks, D.

An endangered species is usually a taxonomic [[species]], but may be another [[evolutionary significant unit]]. The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) has classified 38 percent of the 44,837 species assessed by 2008 as threatened.<ref name = \"IUCN\">[http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/the_iucn_red_list_a_key_conservation_tool_factsheet_en.pdf Factsheet: The IUCN Red List a key conservation tool (2008)]</ref>\n\n== International ==\n{{main|International crisis|Crisis management}}\n\nFor information about crises in the field of study in [[international relations]], see [[crisis management]] and [[international crisis]]. In this context, a crisis can be loosely defined as a situation where there is a perception of threat, heightened anxiety, expectation of possible violence and the belief that any actions will have far-reaching consequences (Lebow, 7\u201310).\n\n== Personal ==\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_131.png|thumb|right|Messengers going to Job, each with bad news, 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nA personal crisis occurs when an individual can no longer cope with a situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\">Lanceley, F. J. (2003). On-Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators, Second Edition (2nd ed.). London: CRC Press.</ref> This is preceded by events of an extraordinary nature triggering extreme tension and stress within an individual, i.e., the crisis, which then requires major decisions or actions to resolve. Crises can be triggered by a wide range of situations including, but not limited to, [[extreme weather]] conditions, sudden change in employment/financial state, medical emergencies, long-term illness, and social or familial turmoil. Crises are simply a change in the events that comprise the day-to-day life of a person and those in their close circle, such as the loss of a job, extreme financial hardship, substance addiction/abuse and other situations that are life altering and require action that is outside the \"normal\" daily routine. A person going through a crisis experiences a state of mental disequilibrium, in which the ego struggles to balance both internal and external demands.<ref name=\"Woolley\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woolley | first1 = N | year = 1990 | title = Crisis theory: A paradigm of effective intervention with families of critically ill people | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 1402\u20131408 | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2648.1990.tb01782.x}}</ref> In this case, said person resorts to [[coping mechanism]]s to deal with the stress. Various coping mechanisms include:<ref name=\"NBPG\">Nursing Best Practice Guideline: Shaping the future of Nursing. (Electronic book). Appendix C - Assessment of coping skills and support systems. (Page 53). Executive Director: Doris Grispun, RN, MScN, PhD. Date: August 2002.</ref>\n* High emotions (crying, physical withdrawal)\n* Defence mechanisms (denial, repression)\n* Making rash decisions\n* Acting out\n* Putting things on hold\n\nIn some cases, it is difficult for an individual undergoing a crisis to adapt to the situation. As it is outside of their normal range of functioning, it is common that one endures a struggle to control emotions. This lack of control can lead to suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, trouble with the law and general avoidance of resources available for help. One such resource used to aid an individual in crisis is their social support system, which can come in the form of family, friends, coworkers, or health professionals. It is important that a support system consists of people that the individual trusts. Although these support systems play a crucial role in aiding an individual through a crisis, they are also the underlying cause of two thirds of mental health crises.<ref name=\"NBPG\"/> The aforementioned mental health crises can include marital issues, abandonment, parental conflict and family struggles.\n\nIn order to aid someone in a crisis, it is crucial to be able to identify the signs that indicate they are undergoing an internal conflict. These signs, as well as the aforementioned coping mechanisms, include:<ref name=\"Lancely\"/><ref>Vecchi, G. M. (2009). Conflict and crisis communication. Annals of the American Psychotherapy Association, 12(2), 32-29.</ref>\n* Irrational and/or narrow thinking\n* Lowered attention span\n* Unclear motives\n* Disorganized approach to problem solving\n* Resistance to communication\n* Inability to differ between large and small issues\n* Change/alteration to social networks\n\n===Ways to manage a crisis===\nAs aforementioned, a crisis to this day can be overcome by implementing mechanisms such as: [[sleep]], [[Social rejection|rejection]], physical [[exercise]], [[meditation]] and [[thinking]]. To assist individuals in regaining emotional equilibrium, intervention can be used. The overall goal of a crisis intervention is to get the individual back to a pre-crisis level of functioning or higher with the help of a social support group. As said by Judith Swan, there's a strong correlation between the client's emotional balance and the trust in their support system in helping them throughout their crisis.<ref>Swan, J., & Hamilton, P.M. (2014). Mental health crisis management. Wild Iris Medical Education, Inc.</ref> The steps of crisis intervention are: to assess the situation based on behaviour patterns of the individual, decide what type of help is needed (make a plan of action) and finally to take action/intervention, based on the individual's skills to regain equilibrium.<ref name=\"Woolley\"/>\n\nThe Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario proposed the ABC model for dealing with client's interventions in crises:<ref>Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario. (2006). Crisis intervention. Toronto, ON: Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario.</ref>\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n    |1=<!--A-->Basic attending skills (making the person comfortable, remaining calm, etc.)\n    |2=<!--B-->Identifying the problem and therapeutic interaction (explore their perceptions, identify sources of emotional distress, identify impairments in behavioural functioning, use therapeutic interactions)\n    |3=<!--C-->Coping (identify coping attempts, present alternative coping strategies, follow up post-crisis)\n}}\n\n===Benefits of listening in a crisis===\nMoreover, another method for helping individuals who are suffering in a crisis is active listening; it is defined as seeing circumstances from another perspective and letting the other person know that the negotiator (the helper) understands their perspective. Through this, they establish trust and rapport by demonstrating empathy, understanding and objectivity in a non-judgmental way. It is important for the negotiator to listen to verbal and non-verbal reactions of the person in need, in order to be able to label the emotion that the individual is showing. Thus, this demonstrates that the helper is tuned in emotionally. Furthermore, there are other techniques that can be used to demonstrate actively listening such as: paraphrasing, silence and reflecting or mirroring. The goal in active listening is to keep the person talking about their situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\" />\n\n== In chaos theory==\n{{main| Crisis (dynamical systems)}}\n\nWhen the control parameter of a chaotic system is modified, the chaotic [[attractor]] touches an unstable\nperiodic orbit inside the basin of attraction inducing a sudden expansion in the attractor.\nThis phenomenon is termed as interior crisis in a chaotic system.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Constitutional crisis]]\n* [[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Crisis state]]\n* [[Crisis management]]\n* [[Hostage crisis]]\n* [[Distress signal]]\n** [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]\n** [[SOS]]\n{{col-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Ecological crisis]]\n* [[Energy crisis]]\n* [[Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management]]\n* [[Mid-life crisis]]\n* [[Revolution]]\n* [[War]]\n* [[Crysis]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Borodzicz, E.

Aylen then became engineer officer of the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Kelvin (F37)|HMS ''Kelvin'']], which formed part of the [[5th Destroyer Flotilla]] under [[Louis Mountbatten|Captain the Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. On one occasion, while the ''Kelvin'' was in [[Bombay]] for repairs, Aylen and a party of sailors visited the [[Khyber Pass]]. Aylen and the ''Kelvin'' then went on to see action at the [[Second Battle of Sirte]] on 22 March 1942. He received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] for his efforts during the action.\n\n==Germany==\nHe briefly left front-line service towards the end of the war and was based at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Desiring to return to a more active role he volunteered for the [[30 Assault Unit|30th Assault Unit]], under the intelligence officer [[Ian Fleming|Cdr Ian Fleming, RNVR]]. He advanced with [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] troops across the [[Rhine]] and headed for the [[U-boat]] research establishments on the Baltic coast as the German army collapsed. Aylen then moved to [[Flensburg]] with orders to gather evidence on technical aid supplied by Germany to Japan, and was involved in the questioning of the remaining senior member of the [[Seekriegsleitung|German Admiralty]].\n\nAfter the end of the war and between May and November 1945 he took over the [[Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft|Walterwerke]] and questioned scientist [[Hellmuth Walter]] about his work with [[hydrogen peroxide]]. He was instrumental in persuading Walter to bring their equipment to [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Vickers' shipyard]] at Barrow. Aylen was appointed OBE for his work in Germany.\n\n==Post war==\nAylen spent two years aboard the destroyer [[HMS Cossack (R57)|HMS ''Cossack'']] at [[Hong Kong]], and then at the training establishment, [[HMS Caledonia (1946 shore establishment)|HMS ''Caledonia'']]. Two years were spent on the [[Admiralty Interview Board]], followed by a posting as the Home Fleet Engineering Officer, and then [[Admiral-Superintendent|Admiral Superintendent]] at [[Rosyth Dockyard]].\n\nHe was first appointed Commander of the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]] from 7 August 1958 to 7 July 1960 when he held the rank of Captain upon promotion to Rear-Admiral he continued as commander from 7 July 1960 to 30 July 1960.\n\nAylen, by now appointed CB, worked for the [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers]] after his retirement from the navy in 1962 and lived at [[Honiton]], though he remained an active commentator on naval affairs.

Aylen and the ''Kelvin'' then went on to see action at the [[Second Battle of Sirte]] on 22 March 1942. He received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] for his efforts during the action.\n\n==Germany==\nHe briefly left front-line service towards the end of the war and was based at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Desiring to return to a more active role he volunteered for the [[30 Assault Unit|30th Assault Unit]], under the intelligence officer [[Ian Fleming|Cdr Ian Fleming, RNVR]]. He advanced with [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] troops across the [[Rhine]] and headed for the [[U-boat]] research establishments on the Baltic coast as the German army collapsed. Aylen then moved to [[Flensburg]] with orders to gather evidence on technical aid supplied by Germany to Japan, and was involved in the questioning of the remaining senior member of the [[Seekriegsleitung|German Admiralty]].\n\nAfter the end of the war and between May and November 1945 he took over the [[Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft|Walterwerke]] and questioned scientist [[Hellmuth Walter]] about his work with [[hydrogen peroxide]]. He was instrumental in persuading Walter to bring their equipment to [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Vickers' shipyard]] at Barrow. Aylen was appointed OBE for his work in Germany.\n\n==Post war==\nAylen spent two years aboard the destroyer [[HMS Cossack (R57)|HMS ''Cossack'']] at [[Hong Kong]], and then at the training establishment, [[HMS Caledonia (1946 shore establishment)|HMS ''Caledonia'']]. Two years were spent on the [[Admiralty Interview Board]], followed by a posting as the Home Fleet Engineering Officer, and then [[Admiral-Superintendent|Admiral Superintendent]] at [[Rosyth Dockyard]].\n\nHe was first appointed Commander of the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]] from 7 August 1958 to 7 July 1960 when he held the rank of Captain upon promotion to Rear-Admiral he continued as commander from 7 July 1960 to 30 July 1960.\n\nAylen, by now appointed CB, worked for the [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers]] after his retirement from the navy in 1962 and lived at [[Honiton]], though he remained an active commentator on naval affairs. He died on 5 November 2003, survived by his son and daughters.\n\n== Sources ==\n*Extracted from [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1447608/Rear-Admiral-Jan-Aylen.html Obituary - Rear-Admiral Jan Aylen, The Daily Telegraph, 24 November 2003]\n*[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1025299.ece Obituary - Rear-Admiral Jan Aylen, The Times, 25 November 2003]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersA8.html#Aylen_IG Royal Navy (RN) Officers 1939-1945]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aylen, Jan}}\n[[Category:1910 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n[[Category:People educated at Blundell's School]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy admirals]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy officers of World War II]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy Commando officers]]\n[[Category:People from Saltash]]\n[[Category:Devonport Services R.F.C. players]]\n", "name_user": "Gazamp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:AddedPortal:Cornwall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Aylen"}

He was initially a wing spiker in junior high school and is currently a middle blocker. He inherits the number 10 from his idol, the former Karasuno ace known as the Little Giant. His play style makes him an excellent decoy, and though he wishes to become the team's ace, he grows to learn the importance of the decoy role and embraces it. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular. He is able to play exceptionally well when partnered with Kageyama as his setter.

He is the team's setter and was notoriously known as the \"King of the Court\" in junior high. While prodigiously talented, Kageyama's arrogant demeanor and inability to cooperate with teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match, which deeply affected him and earned his nickname. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball. Kageyama is regarded by many to be a genius, with exceptional accuracy and instincts, and is one of the team's pillars. Nevertheless, he has poor social skills and difficulty expressing himself, often engaging in shouting matches with Hinata.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Daichi Sawamura|\u6fa4\u6751 \u5927\u5730|Sawamura Daichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]]<ref name=haikyuucast2>{{cite web|title=Satoshi Hino, Miyu Irino, Yuu Hayashi Join Haikyuu Anime Cast|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-13/satoshi-hino-miyu-irino-yuu-hayashi-join-haikyu-anime-cast|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>|Justin Doran<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Keita Tanaka (2015, 2018),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/><ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\">{{cite news | first=Rafael Antonio | last=Pineda | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-27/haikyu-5th-stage-play-new-cast-visual-debut-dates-revealed/.124542 | title=Haikyu!! 5th Stage Play's New Cast, Visual, Debut Dates Revealed | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2017-11-27 | accessdate=2019-07-15 }}</ref> Kentaro Akisawa (2016-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\"/> Sho Higano (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Sawamura is the captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He is a wing spiker, and very dependable at receiving.

He is cheerful, soft-spoken, and empathetic - Coach Ukai notes that he has the full trust of his teammates. Sugawara is often able to devise new tactics and ideas, as well as sense if a fellow player is off their game.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ry\u016bnosuke Tanaka|\u7530\u4e2d \u9f8d\u4e4b\u4ecb|Tanaka Ry\u016bnosuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Hayashi]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast2\" />|Greg Cote<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: [[Kouhei Shiota]] (2015-2018),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Ko Kanegae (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Tanaka is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker.

He's considered the team's ace and powerhouse. His long hair, tall stature, and impressive strength often intimidate others at first, while some onlookers even suggest he is full-grown man who was held back. Despite this, he is timid and sometimes struggles with self-doubt, often referred to as having a \"glass heart\".

Nishinoya is considered the backbone of the team, as his specialties are receives and block recovery. He has a close friendship with Asahi, refusing to play unless the latter returned to his role as the team's ace.

He's known to have a \"disgusting personality\" amongst both opponents and his own teammates because of his smug attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blas\u00e9 exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weaknesses.\n:He works extremely hard, as is evident by his vigorous practices and injuries caused by overworking in training before. His own teammates have pointed out his rigorous schedule. In addition, Oikawa spends time watching past games of his rivals, observing their movements ahead of time and strategizing how to defeat them. His intelligence and game sense are also unparalleled, as shown when he points out his opponents' weaknesses in a short period of time. He is also capable of rising his teammates' performance by passing them the perfect tosses, no matter their habits or his relationships towards them. \n:In his free time, he coaches his nephew and other children at Lil Tykes Volleyball Classroom.

When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Issei Matsukawa|\u677e\u5ddd \u4e00\u9759|Matsukawa Issei}} \n:{{voiced by|Isamu Y\u016bsen|Paul Locklear<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Matsukawa is one of the middle blockers and a third-year student.

He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aoba J\u014dsai team to look up to and respect him.

He seems to enjoy being challenged, due to the fact that he smiled when Nishinoya used the same move as him when he set from the back row. It is shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Ky\u014dtani after he misses a point, regardless of Ky\u014dtani's lack of proximity with the rest of the team.

Kageyama did not like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kentar\u014d Ky\u014dtani|\u4eac\u8c37 \u8ce2\u592a\u90ce|Ky\u014dtani Kentar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!!

His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.\n:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.\n\n===Nekoma High===\nThe word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese. Thus, when there used to be rivalry between Nekoma and Karasuno, it was often referred to as the \"trashcan showdown\" or \"Cat Vs. Crow\".

He is deemed to be talented middle blocker by coach Ukai Jr. During practice matches, he gives a lot of tips and advice to Tsukishima (particularly) about blocking, as he wants to fulfill his coach's dream of battling it out with Karasuno at the Nationals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nobuyuki Kai|\u6d77 \u4fe1\u884c|Kai Nobuyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takanori Hoshino]]|Joel McCray<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kai is a third-year student at Nekoma High and is the vice-captain and wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out, and also has bad luck when it comes to girls. He and Kenma would often have arguments, since he believes in putting in all his power and going all out, but Kenma doesn't like to spend his energy.

He is an introvert, choosing to play video games instead of playing outside and doesn't interact well with people. But he is very skilled at volleyball, since he is very observant due to him being nervous around people, and has the ability to come up with excellent strategies to counter the opposite team. He is childhood friends with Kuroo. He also became good friends with Hinata after meeting by coincidence when the both of them happen to get lost. Their encounter had taken place before they'd met officially for a practice game between their schools. He is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' for the Nekoma team, and all of his teammates are very protective of him and admire him greatly. It is shown that he texts Hinata often, revealing that even though they have opposite personalities, they are still good friends with each other.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sh\u014dhei Fukunaga|\u798f\u6c38 \u62db\u5e73|Fukunaga Sh\u014dhei}}\n:{{voiced by|Sh\u014dta Ch\u014dnan|Matthew Carter<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Fukunaga is a second-year student at Nekoma and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality. He is the first player who was able to stop Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick strike fully. His positive attitude shows most when he praises Hinata for being able to come up with a new shot in the middle of the game, after the weird quick was stopped. He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they were playing as rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lev Haiba|\u7070\u7fbd \u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30d5|Haiba Ri\u0113bu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mark Ishii]]|Mike Yager<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>}}\n:Lev is a first-year at Nekoma and a middle blocker.

He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|\u9752\u6839 \u9ad8\u4f38|Aone Takanobu}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended for Hinata when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Obara|\u5c0f\u539f \u8c4a|Obara Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|Isamu Yusen|Jason Duga}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kousuke Sakunami|\u4f5c\u4e26 \u6d69\u8f14|Sakunami Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|Mao \u014cnishi|Joel McCray}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and libero for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kanji Koganegawa |\u9ec4\u91d1\u5ddd\u8cab\u81f3|Koganegawa Kanji}}\n:{{voiced by|Masayuki Shouji|Mason Butler}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Haikyu!!

Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very new to setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead. He has an extremely energetic personality and believes that a player should give everything they have in a game. He, too, later ends up being friends with Hinata.\n\n===Fukurodani Academy===\n\nThe word 'Fukuro' in the school name means 'owl'.

He is called 'simple-minded' by his teammates and is easily flattered by praise, as shown by Hinata and his teammates. He especially like praise from Akaashi, and has begged him multiple times for it. In spite of this, he is a very talented volleyball player, being one of the top 5 aces in the country. He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he is never bothered by how strong the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a \"weird\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keiji Akaashi|\u8d64\u8466 \u4eac\u6cbb|Akaashi Keiji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Jeremy Gee}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy.

He is also a talented setter.\n\n===Shiratorizawa Academy===\nThe word 'Shiratori' in the school name \"Shiratorizawa\" means 'swan'. They were the undefeated champions in Miyagi prefecture. Their play style centers around the powerful \"left cannon\", i.e., around the ace wing spiker. Coach Ukai Jr has commented that the Shiratori team's power is more of an addition of each player's strength, as compared to other teams' multiplication, since each player only plays to his own skills.\n;{{nihongo|Wakatoshi Ushijima|\u725b\u5cf6\u82e5\u5229|Ushijima Wakatoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|Ry\u014dta Takeuchi|Joe Daniels}}<ref name=\"Shiratorizawa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-14/3rd-haikyu-anime-casts-shiratorizawa-gakuen-volleyball-club/.104311|title=3rd Haikyu!!

He, unlike the other Shiratorizawa players, did not receive a sports scholarship to Shiratorizawa.

Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular.

He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball.

He's known to have a \"disgusting personality\" amongst both opponents and his own teammates because of his smug attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blas\u00e9 exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weaknesses.\n:He works extremely hard, as is evident by his vigorous practices and injuries caused by overworking in training before. His own teammates have pointed out his rigorous schedule. In addition, Oikawa spends time watching past games of his rivals, observing their movements ahead of time and strategizing how to defeat them. His intelligence and game sense are also unparalleled, as shown when he points out his opponents' weaknesses in a short period of time. He is also capable of rising his teammates' performance by passing them the perfect tosses, no matter their habits or his relationships towards them. \n:In his free time, he coaches his nephew and other children at Lil Tykes Volleyball Classroom.

When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Issei Matsukawa|\u677e\u5ddd \u4e00\u9759|Matsukawa Issei}} \n:{{voiced by|Isamu Y\u016bsen|Paul Locklear<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Matsukawa is one of the middle blockers and a third-year student.

He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aoba J\u014dsai team to look up to and respect him.

Kageyama did not like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kentar\u014d Ky\u014dtani|\u4eac\u8c37 \u8ce2\u592a\u90ce|Ky\u014dtani Kentar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!!

His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.\n:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.\n\n===Nekoma High===\nThe word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese.

Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|\u9752\u6839 \u9ad8\u4f38|Aone Takanobu}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended for Hinata when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Obara|\u5c0f\u539f \u8c4a|Obara Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|Isamu Yusen|Jason Duga}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kousuke Sakunami|\u4f5c\u4e26 \u6d69\u8f14|Sakunami Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|Mao \u014cnishi|Joel McCray}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and libero for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kanji Koganegawa |\u9ec4\u91d1\u5ddd\u8cab\u81f3|Koganegawa Kanji}}\n:{{voiced by|Masayuki Shouji|Mason Butler}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Haikyu!!

Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very new to setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead. He has an extremely energetic personality and believes that a player should give everything they have in a game. He, too, later ends up being friends with Hinata.\n\n===Fukurodani Academy===\n\nThe word 'Fukuro' in the school name means 'owl'.

He is called 'simple-minded' by his teammates and is easily flattered by praise, as shown by Hinata and his teammates. He especially like praise from Akaashi, and has begged him multiple times for it. In spite of this, he is a very talented volleyball player, being one of the top 5 aces in the country. He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he is never bothered by how strong the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a \"weird\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keiji Akaashi|\u8d64\u8466 \u4eac\u6cbb|Akaashi Keiji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Jeremy Gee}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy.

He is also a talented setter.\n\n===Shiratorizawa Academy===\nThe word 'Shiratori' in the school name \"Shiratorizawa\" means 'swan'. They were the undefeated champions in Miyagi prefecture. Their play style centers around the powerful \"left cannon\", i.e., around the ace wing spiker. Coach Ukai Jr has commented that the Shiratori team's power is more of an addition of each player's strength, as compared to other teams' multiplication, since each player only plays to his own skills.\n;{{nihongo|Wakatoshi Ushijima|\u725b\u5cf6\u82e5\u5229|Ushijima Wakatoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|Ry\u014dta Takeuchi|Joe Daniels}}<ref name=\"Shiratorizawa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-14/3rd-haikyu-anime-casts-shiratorizawa-gakuen-volleyball-club/.104311|title=3rd Haikyu!!

He is known as the 'Guess Monster' as his blocking style is guess blocking, which involves guessing which spiker the opposite team's setter will pass the ball to, and also where the spiker will hit the ball. His guesses are known to be either 120% or 0%, since if they are right, he will definitely block them, but if they are wrong, there is no way he can stop them.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tsutomu Goshiki|\u4e94\u8272\u5de5|Goshiki Tsutomu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shimba Tsuchiya]]|Howard Wang}}<ref name=\"Shiratorizawa\"/><ref name=\":0\" />\n:Goshiki is a first year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

He, unlike the other Shiratorizawa players, did not receive a sports scholarship to Shiratorizawa. He watched the match between Shiratorizawa Middle School volleyball team and Kitagawa Daichii, and decides to join Shiratorizawa, since the pressure of winning will not lay on the setter, by Shiratorizawa's play style.

With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131988), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref name=\"elliott\">{{cite book |author1=White, Harry |author2=Boydell, Barra  |title=The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland |publisher=University College Dublin Press |date=15 September 2013 |location=Dublin |pages= |url=http://www.ucdpress.ie/display.asp?isbn=9781906359782 |isbn=978-1906359782 }}</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref name=\"elliott\"/>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative.

Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Harry |title=The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland |journal=The Irish Review |volume=6 |issue=Spring 1989 |pages=39_45 |publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork |date=1989 |url= |jstor=29735420 |issn= 07907850 |doi=10.2307/29735420 |accessdate= }}</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J.

Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref name=\"bodley elliott\"/> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018).

With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131988), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref name=\"elliott\">{{cite book |author1=White, Harry |author2=Boydell, Barra  |title=The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland |publisher=University College Dublin Press |date=15 September 2013 |location=Dublin |pages= |url=http://www.ucdpress.ie/display.asp?isbn=9781906359782 |isbn=978-1906359782 }}</ref>\n\nRobin Elliott: \"White, Harry\", in: '''' (2013), see Bibliography.</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993.

Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007).

Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref name=\"bodley elliott\"/> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Polite Forms |work= |publisher=Carysfort Press |date=30 March 2012 |url=http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 }}</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Well-tempered Festschrift.

{"title_page": "Trade in Maya civilization", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2013}}\n{{Maya civilization}} \n[[File:Maritime Trade Goods Chart.jpg|thumb|Ancient Maya Maritime Trade Resources]]\n'''Trade in Maya civilization''' was a crucial factor in maintaining [[Maya city|Maya cities]].\n\nChief staples of Maya economic activities were centered primarily around foods like [[fish]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[maize|corn]], [[honey]], [[beans]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[vegetables]], [[chocolate]] drinks; raw materials such as limestone, marble, jade, wood, copper and gold; and manufactured goods such as paper, books, furniture, jewelry, clothing, carvings, toys, weapons, and luxury goods. The Maya also had an important service sector, through which mathematicians, farming consultants, artisans, architects, astronomers, scribes and artists would sell their services.\n\nSpecialized craftsmen also played a large part, creating luxury items and developing devices to overcome specific problems usually by royal decree. They also engaged in long range trade of almost any other necessities such as salt, potato, stone and luxury items because there was a large need for trade in order to bring such basic goods together. The types of trade varied greatly regionally with specific districts of kingdoms typically specializing in a specific trade which contained workers of every skill set needed to produce their designated specialty. Areas were typically given a designated specialty based upon the resources available in their areas which allowed for very rapid production and distribution of a regions products.\n\n==Structure==\nThe Maya relied on a strong middle class of skilled and semi-skilled workers and artisans which produced both commodities and specialized goods.<ref>{{cite hi guys welcome to my new viedo today we will be playing minecreaft\nweb|url=http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Mapping_the_Mirador_Basin:_Exploration_and_New_Technology_in_the_Cradle_of_Maya_Civilization|title=Mapping the Mirador Basin: Exploration and New Technology in the Cradle of Maya Civilization|publisher=}}</ref> Governing this middle class was smaller class of specially educated merchant governors who would direct regional economies based upon simple supply and demand analysis who would place mass orders as needed by other regions. Above the merchants were highly skilled specialists such as artists, mathematicians, architects, advisers, astronomers. The specialist class would sell their services and create luxury goods based upon their specific skill set. At the top of the structure was a ruler, or rulers, and an array of advisers who would manage trade with other kingdoms, ensure that regions remained stable, inject capital into specific sectors and authorize construction of large public works.\n \nFor decades, Maya exchange systems and overall economic systems have been viewed as overly simplistic and adhering to ideas of preindustrial political economies put forth by Polanyi.<ref> (Feinman and Garraty 2010:169; Hirth 1996:204)</ref> In the mid-20th century, political economy was examined with an emphasis on identifying the evolution of political organization rather than understanding the economic systems that set the foundation for how they function.<ref>(Hirth 1996:203)</ref>  Polanyi put forth three modes of exchange for the Maya: reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange, which limited Maya societies to chiefdom levels of societal complexity.<ref> (Dahlin 2009:342)</ref> In Polanyi's model of Maya economy there existed highly centralized control of exchange by the elite members of society who maintained their status and a system of civic-ceremonial infrastructure through taxation of tribute goods followed by redistribution down the social ladder to secure loyalty and fealty from others.<ref> (Dahlin 2009:342)</ref>\n\nPolanyi's legacy and the subsequent substantive versus formalist debate have reduced interest in the discussion of preindustrial market economies and have created a market/no market dichotomy in political economy literature.<ref> (Feinman and Garraty 2010:169)</ref> However, as more research has been conducted on Maya trade and exchange systems there have been multiple models put forth that recognize higher levels of complexity, various degrees of participation, and fluctuating economic hello\n scales related to political organization and collapse.<ref> (Rathje and Sabloff 1973; Hirth 1996; Feinman and Garraty 2010; Braswell 2010)</ref> The delineation of trade routes, and acceptance of marketplaces and market exchange economies, has increased due in large part to the archaeological research surrounding Maya obsidian procurement, distribution, production, and exchange.<ref> (Asaro et al. 1978; Golitko and Feinman 2015; Shaw 2012; Coronel 2011)</ref>\n\nIt is now believed that Classic Maya cities were highly integrated and urbanized yes\n, featuring marketplaces and market economies to exchange many goods including obsidian.

For more expensive purchases gold, jade and copper were used as a means of exchange.a<ref>http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/aztec/maya_commercial.html</ref> However, these mediums of exchange are not \"money\" in the modern sense, in different sites and cities, these mediums of exchange were valued differently.<ref name=\"How the Ancient Maya Did Business\">{{Cite web|title = How the Ancient Maya Did Business|url = http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/Maya/p/Ancient-Maya-Economy-And-Trade.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nBecause of the readily available trade resources and local merchants in most of the Maya territory, small towns did not need to take part in long-distance trading and limited trade to local exchange. Despite the fact that the area was rich in resources, even the most self-sufficient farm families, which were the vast majority of the population, still had to participate in exchanges in order to obtain the necessities (the necessities would generally include some pottery, bronze or copper tools, salt, and imported fish for inland areas). As craftsmen in small cities began to specialize and the cities began to grow, so did the need for increased trade. Cities such as [[Tikal]] and [[El Mirador]] are two such examples. Tikal, specifically, had a population somewhere in the range of 60,000\u2013120,000 people, which means it would have needed to get food and other goods from up to 100&nbsp;km away. Because of the size of these, they would have also needed a larger amount of control from the Rulers to oversee it. Eventually the increased trade, and growing cities gave the Rulers more power over their territory and their subjects.\n\nHowever, not only the central cities in the empire grew. Because of the increased amount of traffic through the smaller cities along trade routes, these once isolated cities grew too, creating a fairly consistent amount of growth throughout the [[Maya civilization#Postclassic period|Post-Classic period]].\n\nEvidence discovered in the past few decades seems to prove that trade was widespread among the Maya. Artifacts collected under grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[National Geographic Society]], and [[Howard University]], show that hard stones and many other goods were moved great distances (despite the inefficiency of moving goods without so-called 'beasts of burden'). Modern chemical tests have taken these artifacts and confirmed that they originated in locations great distances away. There is also documented trade of goods ranging from honey to [[quetzal]] feathers throughout the Maya region.\n\nThe goods, which were moved and traded around the empire at long distance, include: [[salt]], cotton mantels, slaves, quetzal feathers, flint, chert, obsidian, jade, colored shells, [[Honey]], cacao, copper tools, and ornaments. Due to the lack of wheeled cars and use of animals, these goods traveled Maya area by the sea.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Maya|last = Coe|first = Michael D.|publisher = Thames & Hudson; Eighth edition|date = January 31, 2011|isbn = 978-0500289020|location = |pages = 214}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Maya were so skilled at producing and distributing a wide variety of goods, they built a lifestyle based on trade throughout all of Mesoamerica, which spread to many different groups of people.  It is suggested that because the Maya were so skilled as traders, they may have spared themselves from the wrath of the expanding Aztec empire.  The Aztecs valued the Maya for their able to produce and trade a variety of different commodities, and because of this, the Aztecs did not feel the need to conquer the Maya.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Maya|last = Coe|first = Michael|publisher = Thames & Hudson|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-500-28902-0|location = |pages = 215}}</ref>\n\n==Commodities==\n[[File:Takalik Abaj obsidian 1.jpg|thumb|left|Raw obsidian and obsidian blades, examples of Maya commodities,]]\nAs trade grew in the Postclassic period, so did the demand for commodities.

But some of the other commodities like gold, jade, copper, obsidian and other raw materials were goods that upper class and rulers used to show off their power.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How the Ancient Maya Did Business|url = http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/Maya/p/Ancient-Maya-Economy-And-Trade.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref>\n\n===Salt===\nArguably the most important of these commodities was salt. Salt was not only an important part of the Maya diet, but it also was critical in the preservation of food. By covering meat and other food items in salt the Maya were able to dehydrate it so that it would not rot. Salt, for the most part, was produced near the oceans by drying out large flats of seawater. After the flats were dry, the salt could be collected and moved throughout the empire. The greatest producer of salt in all of Mesoamerica was Yucat\u00e1n, in which the peoples specialized in salt collection and at one point monopolized the entire salt industry.  Although there were several other salt wells further inland, the Yucat\u00e1n people were able to monopolize the salt industry because sea salt was the most valuable and highly demanded kind of salt throughout the Mayan empire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt is estimated that the Early Classic Tikal's population of roughly 45,000 consumed approximately 131.4 tons of salt annually. Not only is it required in diet, but it can also be used as a preservative. Salt was also frequently used for ritual and medicinal purposes. It is also believed that salt was commonly used during childbirth and death. A midwife would offer salt to both parents at birth and a saline solution was sprinkled throughout the house following the death of a family member. Veterans of battle often wore  armor, consisting of short cotton jackets packed with rock salt\u2014the equivalent of the modern \"flack jacket\" and tight bindings of leather or cloth on forearms and legs. Cotton armor is so much more effective than any other protection.\n\nThree major sources of Salt have been identified for the Pet\u00e9n Lowlands Maya sites, the Pacific Lowlands, the Caribbean coast and the Salinas de los Nueve Cerros in the Chixoy river in the Highlands of Alta Verapaz in Guatemala, where the salt is obtained from a brine springs that flows from a Salt dome, curiously its color is black, this site produced an estimated of 2,000 tons per year.  Other in- land sources such as San Mateo Ixtat\u00e1n in Huehuetenango and Sacapulas in Quich\u00e9 also have been documented and are still in use. The Salt was obtained in disposable tin unfired  brine-cooking vessels, such as the ones still used in Sacapulas and San Mateo Ixtat\u00e1n, Guatemala, that not only evaporated the water, but made blocks of salt, the vessel was thus, a single use. In The Pacific Lowlands, platforms were used to obtain sun-dry salt, near La Blanca such platforms have been documented ca 1000 BC, and are perhaps the oldest in Mesoamerica.\n\nBoth methods were used in the production of salt, as has been proved in Nueve Cerros by Andrews and Dillon. The salt was then transported using the river routes, such as the Chixoy, that forms the Usumacinta when it confluences with the Pasi\u00f3n river near Altar de Sacrificios.<ref name=\"Maya Trade and Economy\">{{Cite web|title = Maya Trade and Economy|url = http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_trade_and_economy.htm|website = www.authenticmaya.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120907230229/http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_trade_and_economy.htm|archivedate = 2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Cocoa ===\nChocolate was used throughout the Maya region to make sauces, and for drinks. It was grown mostly in the lowlands, so it was often transported to the highlands. Chocolate has a long and interesting history in Mesoamerica. From the very beginning of Mesoamerican culture some 3500 years ago, it has been associated with long distance trade and luxury. The  Pacific Coast of Guatemala, thought to be the original source of Olmec culture, was, and remained, an important area of cacao cultivation. The Maya passed on the knowledge of cacao through oral histories, in Jade and Obsidian among other  stonework, pottery and the creation of intricate, multicolored documents (codices) that extolled cacao and documented its use in everyday life and rituals, centuries before the arrival of the Spanish. In the centuries after initial contact between the Spaniards and indigenous peoples of the New World, hundreds of descriptive accounts, monographs and treatises were published that contained information on the agricultural, botanical, economic, geographical, historical, medical and nutritional aspects of cacao/chocolate.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cacao|url = http://www.authenticmaya.com/cacao.htm|website = www.authenticmaya.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016093808/http://www.authenticmaya.com/cacao.htm|archivedate = 2015-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Ceramics and Furniture===\nCeramics and furniture were produced in specialized workshops, before being traded for other goods. Often the work produced by a particular artist, or workhouse was heavily sought after by the elite classes of Maya society and therefore artists were usually supported by and primarily catered to the wealthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/maya.htm|title=MAYA, A History of The Mayans|publisher=}}</ref> Art goods such as jade carvings, paintings, ornate furniture and metal ornaments were also circulated through kingdoms, and local areas amongst the elite classes. This was usually the case because of the strong symbol of power and wealth the fine arts provided. The ceramics produced were mainly plates, vases, and cylindrical drinking vessels. When painted, these pots were usually painted red, with gold and black detailing.\n\n===Jade and Obsidian===\n{{see also|Obsidian use in Mesoamerica}}\n\nRare stones such as jade and pyrite were also very important to the Maya elite. These stones were relatively hard to acquire, so having such treasures helped them to solidify their positions in the society. Many of the stones were collected in the highlands of the empire in [[Guatemala]], so when long-distance trade developed, the Maya were able to move more of these precious stones to the lowland cities.\n\nThe Jade route was mainly the [[Motagua river]] and a recently discovered land route in the [[Sierra de las Minas]], and then distributed to all the Maya area and beyond, using canoes in the Caribbean routes, as well as the [[Pasi\u00f3n River]] route via the land route through [[Alta Verapaz]]. A unique and valuable trade item tends to become more valuable as it is traded farther from the source. The incentive is to profit by continuing to trade it until one of three things happens: an owner can't bear to part with it, it reaches a cultural area where it is not valued, or it reaches the bitter end of the trade route.\n\nFor the jadeite axes found on the island of [[Antigua]], the second and third may have both applied. Antigua was the far eastern edge of the [[Taino]] cultural area and of the Caribbean island chain. This finding is significant geologically and archaeologically as it argues for the primacy of Guatemala as the New World source of jadeite jade and refutes an assertion that all exotic gems and minerals in the Eastern Caribbean were sourced from South America, as no jadeite rock is known from there. (See [[Jade]]). The Caribbean route is also the most likely Olmec trade route for Jade.\n\nThe fact that [[Cancu\u00e9n]] appears to have prospered for hundreds of years without warfare and that commerce appeared to play a far more important role in everyday life than religion contradicts the widespread view among scholars that religion and warfare were the sources of power for Maya rulers, particularly toward the end of their dominance, after about 600 A.D.\n\nThis is true also for the Obsidian, transported from the [[El Chayal]] ({{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} north from Kaminaljuy\u00fa), [[San Mart\u00edn Jilotepeque]] and  from the [[Ixtepeque]] quarries, using  a river that confluences with the Motagua River, then it was transported from the Caribbean shores, using the [[R\u00edo Azul]], [[Holmul River (Guatemala)]], and the [[Mopan River]] systems, to distribute it to the major centers in Pet\u00e9n.\n\nIn El Ba\u00fal Cotzumalguapa, in the Pacific Lowlands, large workshops have been documented, the production of artifacts was aimed at manufacturing two major products: prismatic blades and projectile points. Both technological types required specialized skills and a centralized productive organization. The major purpose of this production was serving the local and probably the regional demand of cutting tools, throwing weapons with a cutting point, and instruments for scraping, polishing and perforating, all of which could be a part of household maintenance activities.<ref name=\"Maya Trade and Economy\"/> Economic restructuring during the transition from the [[Maya civilization#Classic period|Classic]] to the Postclassic periods, as well as the beginning of trade over water, allowed for larger volumes of long-distance trade to occur, and therefore the commodities were able to reach throughout the entire Maya region.\n\n====Preclassic Maya-Protoclassic Periods Obsidian====\nObsidian exchange in the [[Preclassic Maya]] period (2000 BC- 250 AD) largely focused on importing large macrocores and flake nodes from Guatemalan highland sources such as Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal. The varying presence and proportions of these different highland obsidian sources at sites across the Maya lowlands suggest multiple trade networks operating independently during the Preclassic. The Tajumulco obsidian source was used as early as the Archaic period (3500-2000 BC) and the Ixtepeque, El Chayal, and San Martin Jilotepque sources were utilized beginning in the Early Preclassic as evidenced by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, or INAA (Asaro et al. 1978:439). El Chayal obsidian from the Guatemalan highlands being found at Preclassic levels in Olmec regions on the Southern Gulf Coast and throughout the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula point to extensive trade networks connecting the Maya region to other parts of Mesoamerica (Asaro et al. 1978; Hirth et al. 2013). The Northern Belize site of Colha demonstrates the recognition of obsidian as a utilitarian resource during the Preclassic, even when other lithic resources such as chert deposits are locally available (Brown et al. 2004).\n\nPreclassic people in the Copan Valley in Western Honduras utilized obsidian primarily from the Guatemalan highlands but also in small quantities from La Esperanza in Honduras and Ucareo and Pachuca in Central Mexico (Aoyama 2001). This is further evidence of extensive trade networks operating in the Preclassic.  Copan demonstrates that there was variation in obsidian technology and trade in the Preclassic. This region did not feature blade production technology until the Late Preclassic, instead primarily relying on informal nodes and flakes with very limited trade of prismatic blades, which is abnormal when compared to surrounding areas (Aoyama 2001). Some regions, such as the inland Central Pet\u00e9n and the Puuc region in Northern Yucat\u00e1n, had relatively low access to obsidian despite drawing from the same primary sources of Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal in the Guatemalan highlands as other regions of Mesoamerica (Rice 1984; Braswell et al. 2011). This variation has been explained by examining potential inland and riverine trade routes that when combined allow for further transport of bulk obsidian from highlands into lowlands as well as competing commercial and distributional systems created by sociopolitical relationships (Hester et al. 1980; Hammon 1972). More recent network analyses that examine the distribution of obsidian and relationship between actors in the exchange systems aid in understanding this variation as well. These network cluster models highlight the prominence of the Southern Gulf region creating connections between Eastern and Western Mesoamerican obsidian exchange as well as the Pacific coastal region bridging the gap as well (Golitko and Feinman 2015). This could explain the lower quantities and smaller scale of obsidian production in the Maya region during the Preclassic. \n\t\nThe Protoclassic is growing in acceptance as a distinct period in Maya history, but is generally referred to as the Terminal Preclassic (0 \u2013 250 AD). Increases in obsidian production technology, procurement, and distribution can be used as lines of evidence in this debate. In Copan and its hinterland regions the pattern of large flakes spalls and small nodules continued until the late Protoclassic when the population increased and a subsequent rise in production technology (Aoyama 2001). Polyhedral cores and blade production debitage are noted in assemblages related to principle urban group residences suggesting political control by a ruler over obsidian trade and distribution (Aoyama 2001). This time period is also when Teotihuacan was established and rose to prominence in Central Mexico. It has been theorized that Teotihuacan dominated the procurement of nearby obsidian sources and controlled the trade of obsidian into the Maya region due to the increasing presence of Central Mexican obsidian in Maya contexts (Aoyama 2001; Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972). Network clustering and distribution analysis shows Teotihuacan as not being thoroughly connected to the overall obsidian exchange systems during the Protoclassic which means control over obsidian cannot explain the city's rise to prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015; Spence 1996). During this time there was also a considerable decrease across the Maya region in the use of Ixtepeque and San Martin Jiotepeque obsidian and increases in El Chayal obsidian; a pattern that continued into the Classic (Hester et al. 1980; Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Healy et al. 1984).\n\n====Classic Period Obsidian====\nThe Classic period Maya region featured large scale prismatic blade production, the exchange of polyhedral cores, and large scale sociopolitical and economic organization (Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Knight and Glascock 2009). A very common form of obsidian used to transport it and derive blades from was the polyhedral core, which was most frequently used from the Early to Late Classic (Trachman 1999). Prismatic blades made from polyhedral cores have been found at Copan and its hinterland regions; a dramatic increase in these blades during the Classic has been attributed to a royal dynasty assuming control over procurement of obsidian and production at two workshops in Copan's epicenter (Aoyama 2001). Most of this obsidian came from the Ixtepeque source to make utilitarian blades that all residents had access to, but green obsidian from central Mexico has been found in elite contexts, suggesting long distance exchange ties to Teotihuacan (Aoyama 2001). It is now believed that Classic Maya cities were highly integrated and urbanized, featuring marketplaces and market economies to exchange many goods including obsidian. A market exchange mechanism has been noted at Classic period Calakmul murals that depict a range of specialists near an area that appears to be a market (Feinman and Garraty 2010). Linguistic evidence shows that there are words in the Yucatec Maya language for \u201cmarket\u201d and \u201cwhere one buys and sells\u201d (Coronel et al. 2015). Network and cluster analyses show Teotihuacan as being more integrated into the overall obsidian exchange network, but not as highly involved as traditionally believed in the literature that posits the city as the dominate connection between East-West Pachuca, Otumba, and Ucareo obsidian exchange networks (Golitko and Feinman 2015). The Maya region is highly integrated into the overall network but it appears that several routes connected the East and West due to the variety of large, urbanized Maya centers as well as marketplace distribution economies (Golitko and Feinman 2015). Teotihuacan is not the superordinate obsidian source for Classic Maya centers, but rather just one large node in the overall system (Golitko and Feinman 2015). El Chayal appears as the dominant source in many regions during the Early Classic, such as Chunchucmil, Wild Cane Cay, Tikal, the Puuc region, the Peten, and Usamacinta River Basin (Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972; Hutson et al. 2010; Moholy-Nagy 1984; McKillop 1989).\n\nTikal played a crucial role in obsidian procurement, production, and distribution during the Classic. Tikal dominated the Great Western Trade Route that transported the widely used El Chayal obsidian during the Early Classic (250-550 AD), sharing dominion with Calakmul and Dos Pilas during the Late Classic (Woodfill and Andrieu 2012). At Tikal, the El Chayal obsidian core to blade ratio discovered was 1:22; this overrepresentation of cores suggests blades being produced and distributed from Tikal through a unique economic system and control over a major trade route (Woodfill and Andrieu 2012). During the Late Classic the Northern Lowlands and Yucutan Peninsula feature prominent East-West obsidian connections, likely due to the decline of Teotihuacan and the Southern Maya Lowland region (Golitko and Feinman 2010). At Late Classic Coba, marketplaces were determined to have existed in two large plazas that featured multiple causeway entrances, linear/parallel market stall architecture, and geochemical signatures of high Phosphorus levels in arranged patterns which indicate the presence of traded organic goods (Coronel et al. 2015). In the Puuc region, more central Mexican obsidian entered and while it does appear to be limited to elites only it does appear to be a highly commercialized and valued exchange good linked to Chichen Itza and market distribution (Braswell et al. 2011). The Ixtepeque source dominated at Copan in the Late/Terminal Classic but it is found more frequently in blade and spear tip forms suggesting instability concurrent with regional collapse at the time (Aoyama 2001). The gradual decline of Chichen Itza beginning in the Terminal Classic and lasting into the Early Postclassic is noted in obsidian cluster and network analyses through a much weaker connection between East and West Mesoamerica; Guatemalan and Honduras sources used in that region and Central Mexican sources used in that region which much less exchange occurring (Golitko and Feinman 2014).\n\n====Post-Classic Period Obsidian====\nObsidian trade was largely relegated to the coast with the collapse of Classic Maya society in the Northern and Southern Lowland regions that occupied the inland areas the Yucutan and River basins. The period from 900-1500 AD saw 80% of the population in the Yucutan remain within 50&nbsp;km of the coast (Rathje and Sabloff 1973). Chichen Itza and Cozumel were used as trading bases by invaders in the Early Postclassic but after a mainland collapse the centralized commercial systems in place collapsed as well (Rathje and Sabloff 1973). For Postclassic Copan, an obsidian pattern similar to the Preclassic returned; nonspecialized production utilizing Ixtepeque obsidian used smaller flakes as opposed to polyhedral cores, resulting in fewer prismatic blades and an overall decline in the quantity and quality of utilitarian obsidian found at the site (Aoyama 2001). Obsidian network and cluster analysis shows weak integration in the Early Postclassic but overall greater integration focused on coastal trade nodes for the Late Postclassic Maya region with reformed connections between East and West, but the inland routes do not regain their former prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015). Very little Central Mexican obsidian is found among Postclassic sites; much of it is believed to be recycled from earlier periods. The site of Colha in Belize utilized Ixtepeque in the Postclassic (Hester et al. 1980). The island site of Wild Cane Cay near Belize was an important port of trade for obsidian among the Postclassic Maya. Obsidian found at Wild Cane Cay is primarily from Highland Guatemala sources but there is some from Central Mexico, with an 80% increase in overall densities mainly in the form of cores during the Postclassic (Mckillop 1989). An estimated 21,686 cores overwhelmingly linked to production areas is recorded for the Postclassic at this site which far exceeds household needs (Mckillop 1989). This positions Wild Cane Cay as an important port of trade in the Postclassic exchange system of obsidian. Ambergis Key on the coast of Belize shows procurement of already reduced polyhedral cores primarily from Ixtepeque obsidian, but other Guatemalan sources are noted (Stemp et al. 2011). The arrival of the Spanish pushed the coastal Maya back inland, disrupting obsidian trade systems developed during the Postclassic which caused the use of recycled cored to rise (Stemp et al. 2011).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geography of Mesoamerica]]\n*[[Maritime trade in the Maya civilization]]\n*[[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica]]\n*[[Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Coe, Michael D., \"The Maya\", Eighth Edition, Thames & Hudson, 2011\n\n== Further reading ==\n* McKillop, Heather. \"The Ancient Maya: New Perspectives\"''.''

The Maya also had an important service sector, through which mathematicians, farming consultants, artisans, architects, astronomers, scribes and artists would sell their services.\n\nSpecialized craftsmen also played a large part, creating luxury items and developing devices to overcome specific problems usually by royal decree. They also engaged in long range trade of almost any other necessities such as salt, potato, stone and luxury items because there was a large need for trade in order to bring such basic goods together. The types of trade varied greatly regionally with specific districts of kingdoms typically specializing in a specific trade which contained workers of every skill set needed to produce their designated specialty. Areas were typically given a designated specialty based upon the resources available in their areas which allowed for very rapid production and distribution of a regions products.\n\n==Structure==\nThe Maya relied on a strong middle class of skilled and semi-skilled workers and artisans which produced both commodities and specialized goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Mapping_the_Mirador_Basin:_Exploration_and_New_Technology_in_the_Cradle_of_Maya_Civilization|title=Mapping the Mirador Basin: Exploration and New Technology in the Cradle of Maya Civilization|publisher=}}</ref> Governing this middle class was smaller class of specially educated merchant governors who would direct regional economies based upon simple supply and demand analysis who would place mass orders as needed by other regions. Above the merchants were highly skilled specialists such as artists, mathematicians, architects, advisers, astronomers. The specialist class would sell their services and create luxury goods based upon their specific skill set. At the top of the structure was a ruler, or rulers, and an array of advisers who would manage trade with other kingdoms, ensure that regions remained stable, inject capital into specific sectors and authorize construction of large public works.\n \nFor decades, Maya exchange systems and overall economic systems have been viewed as overly simplistic and adhering to ideas of preindustrial political economies put forth by Polanyi.<ref> (Feinman and Garraty 2010:169; Hirth 1996:204)</ref> In the mid-20th century, political economy was examined with an emphasis on identifying the evolution of political organization rather than understanding the economic systems that set the foundation for how they function.<ref>(Hirth 1996:203)</ref>  Polanyi put forth three modes of exchange for the Maya: reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange, which limited Maya societies to chiefdom levels of societal complexity.<ref> (Dahlin 2009:342)</ref> In Polanyi's model of Maya economy there existed highly centralized control of exchange by the elite members of society who maintained their status and a system of civic-ceremonial infrastructure through taxation of tribute goods followed by redistribution down the social ladder to secure loyalty and fealty from others.<ref> (Dahlin 2009:342)</ref>\n\nPolanyi's legacy and the subsequent substantivist versus formalist debate have reduced interest in the discussion of preindustrial market economies and have created a market/no market dichotomy in political economy literature.<ref> (Feinman and Garraty 2010:169)</ref> However, as more research has been conducted on Maya trade and exchange systems there have been multiple models put forth that recognize higher levels of complexity, various degrees of participation, and fluctuating economic scales related to political organization and collapse.<ref> (Rathje and Sabloff 1973; Hirth 1996; Feinman and Garraty 2010; Braswell 2010)</ref> The delineation of trade routes, and acceptance of marketplaces and market exchange economies, has increased due in large part to the archaeological research surrounding Maya obsidian procurement, distribution, production, and exchange.<ref> (Asaro et al. 1978; Golitko and Feinman 2015; Shaw 2012; Coronel 2011)</ref>\n\nIt is now believed that Classic Maya cities were highly integrated and urbanized, featuring marketplaces and market economies to exchange many goods including obsidian.

For more expensive purchases gold, jade and copper were used as a means of exchange.a<ref>http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/aztec/maya_commercial.html</ref> However, these mediums of exchange are not \"money\" in the modern sense, in different sites and cities, these mediums of exchange were valued differently.<ref name=\"How the Ancient Maya Did Business\">{{Cite web|title = How the Ancient Maya Did Business|url = http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/Maya/p/Ancient-Maya-Economy-And-Trade.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nBecause of the readily available trade resources and local merchants in most of the Maya territory, small towns did not need to take part in long-distance trading and limited trade to local exchange. Despite the fact that the area was rich in resources, even the most self-sufficient farm families, which were the vast majority of the population, still had to participate in exchanges in order to obtain the necessities (the necessities would generally include some pottery, bronze or copper tools, salt, and imported fish for inland areas). As craftsmen in small cities began to specialize and the cities began to grow, so did the need for increased trade. Cities such as [[Tikal]] and [[El Mirador]] are two such examples. Tikal, specifically, had a population somewhere in the range of 60,000\u2013120,000 people, which means it would have needed to get food and other goods from up to 100&nbsp;km away. Because of the size of these, they would have also needed a larger amount of control from the Rulers to oversee it. Eventually the increased trade, and growing cities gave the Rulers more power over their territory and their subjects.\n\nHowever, not only the central cities in the empire grew. Because of the increased amount of traffic through the smaller cities along trade routes, these once isolated cities grew too, creating a fairly consistent amount of growth throughout the [[Maya civilization#Postclassic period|Post-Classic period]].\n\nEvidence discovered in the past few decades seems to prove that trade was widespread among the Maya. Artifacts collected under grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[National Geographic Society]], and [[Howard University]], show that hard stones and many other goods were moved great distances (despite the inefficiency of moving goods without so-called 'beasts of burden'). Modern chemical tests have taken these artifacts and confirmed that they originated in locations great distances away. There is also documented trade of goods ranging from honey to [[quetzal]] feathers throughout the Maya region.\n\nThe goods, which were moved and traded around the empire at long distance, include: [[salt]], cotton mantels, slaves, quetzal feathers, flint, chert, obsidian, jade, colored shells, [[Honey]], cacao, copper tools, and ornaments. Due to the lack of wheeled cars and use of animals, these goods traveled Maya area by the sea.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Maya|last = Coe|first = Michael D.|publisher = Thames & Hudson; Eighth edition|date = January 31, 2011|isbn = 978-0500289020|location = |pages = 214}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Maya were so skilled at producing and distributing a wide variety of goods, they built a lifestyle based on trade throughout all of Mesoamerica, which spread to many different groups of people.  It is suggested that because the Maya were so skilled as traders, they may have spared themselves from the wrath of the expanding Aztec empire.  The Aztecs valued the Maya for their able to produce and trade a variety of different commodities, and because of this, the Aztecs did not feel the need to conquer the Maya.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Maya|last = Coe|first = Michael|publisher = Thames & Hudson|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-500-28902-0|location = |pages = 215}}</ref>\n\n==Commodities==\n[[File:Takalik Abaj obsidian 1.jpg|thumb|left|Raw obsidian and obsidian blades, examples of Maya commodities,]]\nAs trade grew in the Postclassic period, so did the demand for commodities.

But some of the other commodities like gold, jade, copper, obsidian and other raw materials were goods that upper class and rulers used to show off their power.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How the Ancient Maya Did Business|url = http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/Maya/p/Ancient-Maya-Economy-And-Trade.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref>\n\n===Salt===\nArguably the most important of these commodities was salt. Salt was not only an important part of the Maya diet, but it also was critical in the preservation of food. By covering meat and other food items in salt the Maya were able to dehydrate it so that it would not rot. Salt, for the most part, was produced near the oceans by drying out large flats of seawater. After the flats were dry, the salt could be collected and moved throughout the empire. The greatest producer of salt in all of Mesoamerica was Yucat\u00e1n, in which the peoples specialized in salt collection and at one point monopolized the entire salt industry.  Although there were several other salt wells further inland, the Yucat\u00e1n people were able to monopolize the salt industry because sea salt was the most valuable and highly demanded kind of salt throughout the Mayan empire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt is estimated that the Early Classic Tikal's population of roughly 45,000 consumed approximately 131.4 tons of salt annually. Not only is it required in diet, but it can also be used as a preservative. Salt was also frequently used for ritual and medicinal purposes. It is also believed that salt was commonly used during childbirth and death. A midwife would offer salt to both parents at birth and a saline solution was sprinkled throughout the house following the death of a family member. Veterans of battle often wore  armor, consisting of short cotton jackets packed with rock salt\u2014the equivalent of the modern \"flack jacket\" and tight bindings of leather or cloth on forearms and legs. Cotton armor is so much more effective than any other protection.\n\nThree major sources of Salt have been identified for the Pet\u00e9n Lowlands Maya sites, the Pacific Lowlands, the Caribbean coast and the Salinas de los Nueve Cerros in the Chixoy river in the Highlands of Alta Verapaz in Guatemala, where the salt is obtained from a brine springs that flows from a Salt dome, curiously its color is black, this site produced an estimated of 2,000 tons per year.  Other in- land sources such as San Mateo Ixtat\u00e1n in Huehuetenango and Sacapulas in Quich\u00e9 also have been documented and are still in use. The Salt was obtained in disposable tin unfired  brine-cooking vessels, such as the ones still used in Sacapulas and San Mateo Ixtat\u00e1n, Guatemala, that not only evaporated the water, but made blocks of salt, the vessel was thus, a single use. In The Pacific Lowlands, platforms were used to obtain sun-dry salt, near La Blanca such platforms have been documented ca 1000 BC, and are perhaps the oldest in Mesoamerica.\n\nBoth methods were used in the production of salt, as has been proved in Nueve Cerros by Andrews and Dillon. The salt was then transported using the river routes, such as the Chixoy, that forms the Usumacinta when it confluences with the Pasi\u00f3n river near Altar de Sacrificios.<ref name=\"Maya Trade and Economy\">{{Cite web|title = Maya Trade and Economy|url = http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_trade_and_economy.htm|website = www.authenticmaya.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120907230229/http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_trade_and_economy.htm|archivedate = 2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Cocoa ===\nChocolate was used throughout the Maya region to make sauces, and for drinks. It was grown mostly in the lowlands, so it was often transported to the highlands. Chocolate has a long and interesting history in Mesoamerica. From the very beginning of Mesoamerican culture some 3500 years ago, it has been associated with long distance trade and luxury. The  Pacific Coast of Guatemala, thought to be the original source of Olmec culture, was, and remained, an important area of cacao cultivation. The Maya passed on the knowledge of cacao through oral histories, in Jade and Obsidian among other  stonework, pottery and the creation of intricate, multicolored documents (codices) that extolled cacao and documented its use in everyday life and rituals, centuries before the arrival of the Spanish. In the centuries after initial contact between the Spaniards and indigenous peoples of the New World, hundreds of descriptive accounts, monographs and treatises were published that contained information on the agricultural, botanical, economic, geographical, historical, medical and nutritional aspects of cacao/chocolate.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cacao|url = http://www.authenticmaya.com/cacao.htm|website = www.authenticmaya.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016093808/http://www.authenticmaya.com/cacao.htm|archivedate = 2015-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Ceramics and Furniture===\nCeramics and furniture were produced in specialized workshops, before being traded for other goods. Often the work produced by a particular artist, or workhouse was heavily sought after by the elite classes of Maya society and therefore artists were usually supported by and primarily catered to the wealthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/maya.htm|title=MAYA, A History of The Mayans|publisher=}}</ref> Art goods such as jade carvings, paintings, ornate furniture and metal ornaments were also circulated through kingdoms, and local areas amongst the elite classes. This was usually the case because of the strong symbol of power and wealth the fine arts provided. The ceramics produced were mainly plates, vases, and cylindrical drinking vessels. When painted, these pots were usually painted red, with gold and black detailing.\n\n===Jade and Obsidian===\n{{see also|Obsidian use in Mesoamerica}}\n\nRare stones such as jade and pyrite were also very important to the Maya elite. These stones were relatively hard to acquire, so having such treasures helped them to solidify their positions in the society. Many of the stones were collected in the highlands of the empire in [[Guatemala]], so when long-distance trade developed, the Maya were able to move more of these precious stones to the lowland cities.\n\nThe Jade route was mainly the [[Motagua river]] and a recently discovered land route in the [[Sierra de las Minas]], and then distributed to all the Maya area and beyond, using canoes in the Caribbean routes, as well as the [[Pasi\u00f3n River]] route via the land route through [[Alta Verapaz]]. A unique and valuable trade item tends to become more valuable as it is traded farther from the source. The incentive is to profit by continuing to trade it until one of three things happens: an owner can't bear to part with it, it reaches a cultural area where it is not valued, or it reaches the bitter end of the trade route.\n\nFor the jadeite axes found on the island of [[Antigua]], the second and third may have both applied. Antigua was the far eastern edge of the [[Taino]] cultural area and of the Caribbean island chain. This finding is significant geologically and archaeologically as it argues for the primacy of Guatemala as the New World source of jadeite jade and refutes an assertion that all exotic gems and minerals in the Eastern Caribbean were sourced from South America, as no jadeite rock is known from there. (See [[Jade]]). The Caribbean route is also the most likely Olmec trade route for Jade.\n\nThe fact that [[Cancu\u00e9n]] appears to have prospered for hundreds of years without warfare and that commerce appeared to play a far more important role in everyday life than religion contradicts the widespread view among scholars that religion and warfare were the sources of power for Maya rulers, particularly toward the end of their dominance, after about 600 A.D.\n\nThis is true also for the Obsidian, transported from the [[El Chayal]] ({{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} north from Kaminaljuy\u00fa), [[San Mart\u00edn Jilotepeque]] and  from the [[Ixtepeque]] quarries, using  a river that confluences with the Motagua River, then it was transported from the Caribbean shores, using the [[R\u00edo Azul]], [[Holmul River (Guatemala)]], and the [[Mopan River]] systems, to distribute it to the major centers in Pet\u00e9n.\n\nIn El Ba\u00fal Cotzumalguapa, in the Pacific Lowlands, large workshops have been documented, the production of artifacts was aimed at manufacturing two major products: prismatic blades and projectile points. Both technological types required specialized skills and a centralized productive organization. The major purpose of this production was serving the local and probably the regional demand of cutting tools, throwing weapons with a cutting point, and instruments for scraping, polishing and perforating, all of which could be a part of household maintenance activities.<ref name=\"Maya Trade and Economy\"/> Economic restructuring during the transition from the [[Maya civilization#Classic period|Classic]] to the Postclassic periods, as well as the beginning of trade over water, allowed for larger volumes of long-distance trade to occur, and therefore the commodities were able to reach throughout the entire Maya region.\n\n====Preclassic Maya-Protoclassic Periods Obsidian====\nObsidian exchange in the [[Preclassic Maya]] period (2000 BC- 250 AD) largely focused on importing large macrocores and flake nodes from Guatemalan highland sources such as Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal. The varying presence and proportions of these different highland obsidian sources at sites across the Maya lowlands suggest multiple trade networks operating independently during the Preclassic. The Tajumulco obsidian source was used as early as the Archaic period (3500-2000 BC) and the Ixtepeque, El Chayal, and San Martin Jilotepque sources were utilized beginning in the Early Preclassic as evidenced by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, or INAA (Asaro et al. 1978:439). El Chayal obsidian from the Guatemalan highlands being found at Preclassic levels in Olmec regions on the Southern Gulf Coast and throughout the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula point to extensive trade networks connecting the Maya region to other parts of Mesoamerica (Asaro et al. 1978; Hirth et al. 2013). The Northern Belize site of Colha demonstrates the recognition of obsidian as a utilitarian resource during the Preclassic, even when other lithic resources such as chert deposits are locally available (Brown et al. 2004).\n\nPreclassic people in the Copan Valley in Western Honduras utilized obsidian primarily from the Guatemalan highlands but also in small quantities from La Esperanza in Honduras and Ucareo and Pachuca in Central Mexico (Aoyama 2001). This is further evidence of extensive trade networks operating in the Preclassic.  Copan demonstrates that there was variation in obsidian technology and trade in the Preclassic. This region did not feature blade production technology until the Late Preclassic, instead primarily relying on informal nodes and flakes with very limited trade of prismatic blades, which is abnormal when compared to surrounding areas (Aoyama 2001). Some regions, such as the inland Central Pet\u00e9n and the Puuc region in Northern Yucat\u00e1n, had relatively low access to obsidian despite drawing from the same primary sources of Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal in the Guatemalan highlands as other regions of Mesoamerica (Rice 1984; Braswell et al. 2011). This variation has been explained by examining potential inland and riverine trade routes that when combined allow for further transport of bulk obsidian from highlands into lowlands as well as competing commercial and distributional systems created by sociopolitical relationships (Hester et al. 1980; Hammon 1972). More recent network analyses that examine the distribution of obsidian and relationship between actors in the exchange systems aid in understanding this variation as well. These network cluster models highlight the prominence of the Southern Gulf region creating connections between Eastern and Western Mesoamerican obsidian exchange as well as the Pacific coastal region bridging the gap as well (Golitko and Feinman 2015). This could explain the lower quantities and smaller scale of obsidian production in the Maya region during the Preclassic. \n\t\nThe Protoclassic is growing in acceptance as a distinct period in Maya history, but is generally referred to as the Terminal Preclassic (0 \u2013 250 AD). Increases in obsidian production technology, procurement, and distribution can be used as lines of evidence in this debate. In Copan and its hinterland regions the pattern of large flakes spalls and small nodules continued until the late Protoclassic when the population increased and a subsequent rise in production technology (Aoyama 2001). Polyhedral cores and blade production debitage are noted in assemblages related to principle urban group residences suggesting political control by a ruler over obsidian trade and distribution (Aoyama 2001). This time period is also when Teotihuacan was established and rose to prominence in Central Mexico. It has been theorized that Teotihuacan dominated the procurement of nearby obsidian sources and controlled the trade of obsidian into the Maya region due to the increasing presence of Central Mexican obsidian in Maya contexts (Aoyama 2001; Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972). Network clustering and distribution analysis shows Teotihuacan as not being thoroughly connected to the overall obsidian exchange systems during the Protoclassic which means control over obsidian cannot explain the city's rise to prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015; Spence 1996). During this time there was also a considerable decrease across the Maya region in the use of Ixtepeque and San Martin Jiotepeque obsidian and increases in El Chayal obsidian; a pattern that continued into the Classic (Hester et al. 1980; Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Healy et al. 1984).\n\n====Classic Period Obsidian====\nThe Classic period Maya region featured large scale prismatic blade production, the exchange of polyhedral cores, and large scale sociopolitical and economic organization (Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Knight and Glascock 2009). A very common form of obsidian used to transport it and derive blades from was the polyhedral core, which was most frequently used from the Early to Late Classic (Trachman 1999). Prismatic blades made from polyhedral cores have been found at Copan and its hinterland regions; a dramatic increase in these blades during the Classic has been attributed to a royal dynasty assuming control over procurement of obsidian and production at two workshops in Copan's epicenter (Aoyama 2001). Most of this obsidian came from the Ixtepeque source to make utilitarian blades that all residents had access to, but green obsidian from central Mexico has been found in elite contexts, suggesting long distance exchange ties to Teotihuacan (Aoyama 2001). It is now believed that Classic Maya cities were highly integrated and urbanized, featuring marketplaces and market economies to exchange many goods including obsidian. A market exchange mechanism has been noted at Classic period Calakmul murals that depict a range of specialists near an area that appears to be a market (Feinman and Garraty 2010). Linguistic evidence shows that there are words in the Yucatec Maya language for \u201cmarket\u201d and \u201cwhere one buys and sells\u201d (Coronel et al. 2015). Network and cluster analyses show Teotihuacan as being more integrated into the overall obsidian exchange network, but not as highly involved as traditionally believed in the literature that posits the city as the dominate connection between East-West Pachuca, Otumba, and Ucareo obsidian exchange networks (Golitko and Feinman 2015). The Maya region is highly integrated into the overall network but it appears that several routes connected the East and West due to the variety of large, urbanized Maya centers as well as marketplace distribution economies (Golitko and Feinman 2015). Teotihuacan is not the superordinate obsidian source for Classic Maya centers, but rather just one large node in the overall system (Golitko and Feinman 2015). El Chayal appears as the dominant source in many regions during the Early Classic, such as Chunchucmil, Wild Cane Cay, Tikal, the Puuc region, the Peten, and Usamacinta River Basin (Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972; Hutson et al. 2010; Moholy-Nagy 1984; McKillop 1989).\n\nTikal played a crucial role in obsidian procurement, production, and distribution during the Classic. Tikal dominated the Great Western Trade Route that transported the widely used El Chayal obsidian during the Early Classic (250-550 AD), sharing dominion with Calakmul and Dos Pilas during the Late Classic (Woodfill and Andrieu 2012). At Tikal, the El Chayal obsidian core to blade ratio discovered was 1:22; this overrepresentation of cores suggests blades being produced and distributed from Tikal through a unique economic system and control over a major trade route (Woodfill and Andrieu 2012). During the Late Classic the Northern Lowlands and Yucutan Peninsula feature prominent East-West obsidian connections, likely due to the decline of Teotihuacan and the Southern Maya Lowland region (Golitko and Feinman 2010). At Late Classic Coba, marketplaces were determined to have existed in two large plazas that featured multiple causeway entrances, linear/parallel market stall architecture, and geochemical signatures of high Phosphorus levels in arranged patterns which indicate the presence of traded organic goods (Coronel et al. 2015). In the Puuc region, more central Mexican obsidian entered and while it does appear to be limited to elites only it does appear to be a highly commercialized and valued exchange good linked to Chichen Itza and market distribution (Braswell et al. 2011). The Ixtepeque source dominated at Copan in the Late/Terminal Classic but it is found more frequently in blade and spear tip forms suggesting instability concurrent with regional collapse at the time (Aoyama 2001). The gradual decline of Chichen Itza beginning in the Terminal Classic and lasting into the Early Postclassic is noted in obsidian cluster and network analyses through a much weaker connection between East and West Mesoamerica; Guatemalan and Honduras sources used in that region and Central Mexican sources used in that region which much less exchange occurring (Golitko and Feinman 2014).\n\n====Post-Classic Period Obsidian====\nObsidian trade was largely relegated to the coast with the collapse of Classic Maya society in the Northern and Southern Lowland regions that occupied the inland areas the Yucutan and River basins. The period from 900-1500 AD saw 80% of the population in the Yucutan remain within 50&nbsp;km of the coast (Rathje and Sabloff 1973). Chichen Itza and Cozumel were used as trading bases by invaders in the Early Postclassic but after a mainland collapse the centralized commercial systems in place collapsed as well (Rathje and Sabloff 1973). For Postclassic Copan, an obsidian pattern similar to the Preclassic returned; nonspecialized production utilizing Ixtepeque obsidian used smaller flakes as opposed to polyhedral cores, resulting in fewer prismatic blades and an overall decline in the quantity and quality of utilitarian obsidian found at the site (Aoyama 2001). Obsidian network and cluster analysis shows weak integration in the Early Postclassic but overall greater integration focused on coastal trade nodes for the Late Postclassic Maya region with reformed connections between East and West, but the inland routes do not regain their former prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015). Very little Central Mexican obsidian is found among Postclassic sites; much of it is believed to be recycled from earlier periods. The site of Colha in Belize utilized Ixtepeque in the Postclassic (Hester et al. 1980). The island site of Wild Cane Cay near Belize was an important port of trade for obsidian among the Postclassic Maya. Obsidian found at Wild Cane Cay is primarily from Highland Guatemala sources but there is some from Central Mexico, with an 80% increase in overall densities mainly in the form of cores during the Postclassic (Mckillop 1989). An estimated 21,686 cores overwhelmingly linked to production areas is recorded for the Postclassic at this site which far exceeds household needs (Mckillop 1989). This positions Wild Cane Cay as an important port of trade in the Postclassic exchange system of obsidian. Ambergis Key on the coast of Belize shows procurement of already reduced polyhedral cores primarily from Ixtepeque obsidian, but other Guatemalan sources are noted (Stemp et al. 2011). The arrival of the Spanish pushed the coastal Maya back inland, disrupting obsidian trade systems developed during the Postclassic which caused the use of recycled cored to rise (Stemp et al. 2011).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geography of Mesoamerica]]\n*[[Maritime trade in the Maya civilization]]\n*[[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica]]\n*[[Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Coe, Michael D., \"The Maya\", Eighth Edition, Thames & Hudson, 2011\n\n== Further reading ==\n* McKillop, Heather. \"The Ancient Maya: New Perspectives\"''.''

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

His initial estimate was for an extra two thousand troops but he later raised that to five thousand.<ref name=pakenham76 /> In the end the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] decided to send ten thousand extra troops but they also appointed Lieutenant General Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George White]] to supersede Symons as GOC in Natal.<ref name=pakenham93>Pakenham 1979, p.93 & p.96</ref>\n\nHowever, before White arrived at [[Cape Town]] Penn Symons (who was known as a \"fire eater\"), had on his own authority deployed one of his brigades seventy miles north of [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] at a town called [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]].<ref name=pakenham98>Pakenham 1979, p.98-99</ref> The position of both Ladysmith and Dundee was precarious as they stand in a triangle of Natal north of the [[Tugela River]] with the Orange Free State to the west and the Transvaal to the east. White wanted to recall the Dundee garrison to Ladysmith but because of political pressures from Sir [[Walter Hely-Hutchinson]], the Governor of Natal, he agreed to leave them there.<ref name=pakenham108>Pakenham 1979, p.108-109</ref> The Boers declared war on 11 October and began crossing the Natal borders the following day.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27157|page=497|date=26 January 1900}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Talana Hill====\n{{Main|Battle of Talana Hill}}\n\nOn 20 October 1899 as dawn broke, men of the Dundee garrison spotted Boer troops on the nearby Talana hill (at {{coord|28|6|49|S|30|12|18|E}}) who proceeded to open fire on the town with their [[Creusot 75mm guns]]. Symons was annoyed by the \"impudence\" of the Boers to attack before breakfast.<ref name=burnett13>Burnett 1905, p.13</ref> The British guns moved to return fire as the general surveyed the Boer positions and gave orders to his commanding officers.<ref name=pakenham125>Pakenham 1979, p.125-130</ref>\n\nSymons believed in old fashioned military tactics of [[Close order formation|close order]], where by concentrating troops on the attack he hoped to smash the Boer defences. The reality was that these formations were not designed to be used against long range [[bolt action]] rifles and Symons' brigades would be the first of many in this war to pay the heavy cost of the mistake, as many generals would repeat it. However, his orders for the cavalry commander, Colonel M\u00f6ller, were less conventional, telling him to act on his own initiative; it would be another costly mistake.<ref name=pakenham125 />\n\nAt 7.30am the infantry battalions set off from the east of the town; first the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]], then the 1st [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and lastly the 1st [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] (the 1st [[Leicestershire Regiment]] were left to guard the camp). The first part of the advance went well and they reached a small wood at the foot of the hill where they found some shelter but beyond the wood there was a wall with a small gap and then open ground. Some of the Dublins were pinned down in a ditch ahead and the Fusiliers were lining the wall to the left. Shortly after 9am Symons rode up to the wood being followed by an [[aide-de-camp]] holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled. He ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by his pennant. After a few moments he returned and was helped to remount his horse. He then rode back from the front lines until he was out of sight from his troops before he asked for assistance from the Indian stretcher bearers as he had been shot in the stomach.<ref name=pakenham125 /><!--literally in the digestive organ, or more generally in the abdomen?-->\n\n==Death==\nIn excruciating pain from a severe wound to his stomach, Symons was taken to the 20th Field Hospital at Dundee. Despite this, all that he wanted to know was, \"have they got the hill?\"<ref name=pakenham125 /> While the battle was won, their position at Dundee quickly became untenable. After a few wasted days, Symons' replacement, Brigadier General Yule, decided to abandon the town along with the most severely wounded to the Boers, stealing away at night to Ladysmith. The next day, the town surrendered and thus Symons became a prisoner of war along with many others. He clearly felt betrayed by Yule and just before he died on 23 October he implored the medical officer, Major Donegan, to \"tell everyone I died facing the enemy, tell everyone I died facing the enemy\".<ref name=pakenham142>Pakenham 1979, p.142-147</ref>\n[[File:Victoria Gardens, Saltash - geograph.org.uk - 709984.jpg|thumb|The Symons monument, Saltash]]\n[[Winston Churchill]] wrote in his telegrams to [[The Morning Post]]:\n{{quote|So Sir Penn Symons is killed!  Well, no one would have laid down his life more gladly in such a cause.  Twenty years ago the merest chance saved him from the massacre at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Islandhlwana]], and Death promoted him in an afternoon from subaltern to senior captain.  Thenceforward his rise was rapid.  He commanded the First Division of the Tirah Expeditionary Force among the mountains with prudent skill.  His brigades had no misfortunes: his rearguards came safely into camp.  In the spring of 1898, when the army lay around Fort Jumrood, looking forward to a fresh campaign, I used often to meet him.  Everyone talked of Symons, of his energy, of his jokes, of his enthusiasm.  It was Symons who had built a racecourse on the stony plain; who had organised the Jumrood Spring Meeting; who won the principal event himself, to the delight of the private soldiers, with whom he was intensely popular; who, moreover, was to be first and foremost if the war with the tribes broke out again; and who was entrusted with much of the negotiations with their jirgas.  Dinner with Symons in the mud tower of Jumrood Fort was an experience.  The memory of many tales of sport and war remains.  At the end the General would drink the old Peninsular toasts: 'Our Men', 'Our Women', 'Our Religion', 'Our Swords', 'Ourselves', 'Sweethearts and Wives', and 'Absent Friends'\u2013one for every night of the week.

His initial estimate was for an extra two thousand troops but he later raised that to five thousand.<ref name=pakenham76 /> In the end the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] decided to send ten thousand extra troops but they also appointed Lieutenant General Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George White]] to supersede Symons as GOC in Natal.<ref name=pakenham93>Pakenham 1979, p.93 & p.96</ref>\n\nHowever, before White arrived at [[Cape Town]] Penn Symons (who was known as a \"fire eater\"), had on his own authority deployed one of his brigades seventy miles north of [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] at a town called [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]].<ref name=pakenham98>Pakenham 1979, p.98-99</ref> The position of both Ladysmith and Dundee was precarious as they stand in a triangle of Natal north of the [[Tugela River]] with the Orange Free State to the west and the Transvaal to the east. White wanted to recall the Dundee garrison to Ladysmith but because of political pressures from Sir [[Walter Hely-Hutchinson]], the Governor of Natal, he agreed to leave them there.<ref name=pakenham108>Pakenham 1979, p.108-109</ref> The Boers declared war on 11 October and began crossing the Natal borders the following day.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27157|page=497|date=26 January 1900}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Talana Hill====\n{{Main|Battle of Talana Hill}}\n\nOn 20 October 1899 as dawn broke, men of the Dundee garrison spotted Boer troops on the nearby Talana hill (at {{coord|28|6|49|S|30|12|18|E}}) who proceeded to open fire on the town with their [[Creusot 75mm guns]]. Symons was annoyed by the \"impudence\" of the Boers to attack before breakfast.<ref name=burnett13>Burnett 1905, p.13</ref> The British guns moved to return fire as the general surveyed the Boer positions and gave orders to his commanding officers.<ref name=pakenham125>Pakenham 1979, p.125-130</ref>\n\nSymons believed in old fashioned military tactics of [[Close order formation|close order]], where by concentrating troops on the attack he hoped to smash the Boer defences. The reality was that these formations were not designed to be used against long range [[bolt action]] rifles and Symons' brigades would be the first of many in this war to pay the heavy cost of the mistake, as many generals would repeat it. However, his orders for the cavalry commander, Colonel M\u00f6ller, were less conventional, telling him to act on his own initiative; it would be another costly mistake.<ref name=pakenham125 />\n\nAt 7.30am the infantry battalions set off from the east of the town; first the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]], then the 1st [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and lastly the 1st [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] (the 1st [[Leicestershire Regiment]] were left to guard the camp). The first part of the advance went well and they reached a small wood at the foot of the hill where they found some shelter but beyond the wood there was a wall with a small gap and then open ground. Some of the Dublins were pinned down in a ditch ahead and the Fusiliers were lining the wall to the left. Shortly after 9am Symons rode up to the wood being followed by an [[aide-de-camp]] holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled. He ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by his pennant. After a few moments he returned and was helped to remount his horse. He then rode back from the front lines until he was out of sight from his troops before he asked for assistance from the Indian stretcher bearers as he had been shot in the stomach.<ref name=pakenham125 /><!--literally in the digestive organ, or more generally in the abdomen?-->\n\n==Death==\nIn excruciating pain from a severe wound to his stomach, Symons was taken to the 20th Field Hospital at Dundee. Despite this, all that he wanted to know was, \"have they got the hill?\"<ref name=pakenham125 /> While the battle was won, their position at Dundee quickly became untenable. After a few wasted days, Symons' replacement, Brigadier General Yule, decided to abandon the town along with the most severely wounded to the Boers, stealing away at night to Ladysmith. The next day, the town surrendered and thus Symons became a prisoner of war along with many others. He clearly felt betrayed by Yule and just before he died on 23 October he implored the medical officer, Major Donegan, to \"tell everyone I died facing the enemy, tell everyone I died facing the enemy\".<ref name=pakenham142>Pakenham 1979, p.142-147</ref>\n[[File:Victoria Gardens, Saltash - geograph.org.uk - 709984.jpg|thumb|The Symons monument, Saltash]]\n[[Winston Churchill]] wrote in his telegrams to [[The Morning Post]]:\n{{quote|So Sir Penn Symons is killed!  Well, no one would have laid down his life more gladly in such a cause.  Twenty years ago the merest chance saved him from the massacre at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Islandhlwana]], and Death promoted him in an afternoon from subaltern to senior captain.  Thenceforward his rise was rapid.  He commanded the First Division of the Tirah Expeditionary Force among the mountains with prudent skill.  His brigades had no misfortunes: his rearguards came safely into camp.  In the spring of 1898, when the army lay around Fort Jumrood, looking forward to a fresh campaign, I used often to meet him.  Everyone talked of Symons, of his energy, of his jokes, of his enthusiasm.  It was Symons who had built a racecourse on the stony plain; who had organised the Jumrood Spring Meeting; who won the principal event himself, to the delight of the private soldiers, with whom he was intensely popular; who, moreover, was to be first and foremost if the war with the tribes broke out again; and who was entrusted with much of the negotiations with their jirgas.  Dinner with Symons in the mud tower of Jumrood Fort was an experience.  The memory of many tales of sport and war remains.  At the end the General would drink the old Peninsular toasts: 'Our Men', 'Our Women', 'Our Religion', 'Our Swords', 'Ourselves', 'Sweethearts and Wives', and 'Absent Friends'\u2013one for every night of the week.  The night I dined the toast was 'Our Men'.
