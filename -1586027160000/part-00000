The most outstanding  metalwork produced in ninth century [[England]] was decorated in the animated, complex style.

[[T.D. Kendrick|Sir Thomas Kendrick]] was the first historian to illustrate the  uninterrupted use of Anglo-Saxon animal ornament, from the last days of Roman Britain to the early Anglo-Saxon period. Danish archaeologist, [[Johannes Br\u00f8ndsted]], acknowledged the historical importance of the lively decorative elements of the hoard by naming the ninth century style, the \"Trewhiddle style\".{{sfn|Wilson|1961|pp=99-102}}\n\nTrewhiddle style is most likely the outcome of evolving Anglo-Saxon art forms. The [[Animal style#Germanic animal style|Animal style]] decoration and complex patterns that were found in early England, continued to develop over time. According to David M. Wilson, \"If we look at the animal ornament on the metalwork of any period between 450 and 950, we can see the same traditions at work. The animal on the Faversham brooch, the animal on the [[Sutton Hoo]] clasps, and the animal on the horse trappings of [[K\u00e4llby]] are in a sequence that leads up to Trewhiddle and beyond.\" <ref name=\"Hinton\">{{cite journal |last1=Hinton |first1=David A. |title=Late Anglo-Saxon metalwork: an assesment |journal=Anglo-Saxon England |date=1975 |volume=4 |pages=171\u2013180 |jstor=44511008 |doi=10.1017/S0263675100002775 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sutton Hoo]] shoulder clasp, by c. 620, in an older style.]]\n\nArt historians have recognized important similarities between Trewhiddle art and Irish art, yet no historian has proposed that Trewhiddle art was influenced by Irish art. It is most likely that the animal art of the Trewhiddle objects originated in England and to a small degree was influenced by [[Continental Europe|Continental]] art from the Mediterranean, [[Francia]], or [[Celts|Celtic]] world.{{sfn|Wilson|1961|p=103}}\n\nEarlier scholars have theorized that the Trewhiddle style was confined to the ninth century. The style has been difficult to date given the lack of independent dating evidence associated with Trewhiddle finds. It has been suggested, as more Trewhiddle artefacts continue to be found, that the birth of the Trehiddle style may have occurred in the eighth century. It has also been suggested, given more recent excavation of  Trewhiddle style artefacts, including those found at Anglo-Saxon sites in Yorkshire in the 1980s and the late 1990s, that the Trewhiddle style continued to be produced in [[Northern England]] into the tenth century. Until more information becomes available to Trewhiddle scholars, the style continues to be dated to the ninth century.{{sfn|Thomas|2006|pp=144, 156, 157, 163}}\n \n{{Quote box\n|width     =15em\n|border    = 2px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #FFFACD\t\t\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = \"[Trewhiddle] style has long been recognised as a defining characteristic of much of the ornamental metalwork dated to the 9th century .... During the course of the 9th century, and arguably into the 10th, the Trewhiddle style enjoyed unrivalled prominence in the decoration of high-class metalwork and on the evidence of frequent attempts to copy its motifs in cheaper metals, it was a fashion to which most of the populace aspired.\"\n|salign    = right\n|source=\u2014 ''Gabor Thomas'', 2000.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=71}}}}\n\n==Style features== \nThe Trewhiddle style is recognized for its intricately carved decoration, including animal, plant, interlace and geometric patterns; [[Niello|niello]] inlays, densely decorated surfaces, and dome-headed rivets. A defining feature is the dividing of the main area of decoration into small panels, typically separated by beaded borders. Panels usually contain a single motif, typically a crouching, backward-looking or biting animal.{{sfn|Wilson|1961|pp=104-105}} Speckling of individual motifs was a technique frequently used to create surface texture or movement.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=72}}\n\nThe animal forms are many, including variations of mythical birds, snakes and beasts, usually depicted in profile. Plant motifs vary from intricately carved individual leaves to complete plants, often combined with animal forms and interlace.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=71}} Interlace is more commonly seen combined with zoomorphic and plant motifs, rather than on its own. When used singly, the interlace pattern is typically simple and closed. When used with plant or animal forms, the decoration is generally a more complex design.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=72}}\n\n==Metalwork== \nTrewhiddle style was primarily used to decorate metalwork. During the late Anglo-Saxon era, [[Silver|silver]] was the [[precious metal]] most commonly used to create Trewhiddle style jewellery and to decorate weapons. [[Vikings|Viking]] trade and expansion  during the ninth and tenth centuries brought new supplies of silver from the [[Near East]] to England and [[Scandinavia]]. The rapid change from the use of gold to silver in metalwork manufacturing, was due to abundant new supplies of silver that were made available to craftsmen during this time period. Subsequently, gold became the preferred metal to manufacture finger-rings or for gilding and inlay.{{sfn|Tait|1986|p=112}}  \n\n===Weapons=== \n[[File:Sword_Pommel_from_the_Bedale_Hoard_YORYM_2014_149_1-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bedale Hoard]] sword pommel]] \nTrewhiddle was a commonly used decoration style for late Anglo-Saxon swords.

Until more information becomes available to Trewhiddle scholars, the style continues to be dated to the ninth century.{{sfn|Thomas|2006|pp=144, 156, 157, 163}}\n \n{{Quote box\n|width     =15em\n|border    = 2px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #FFFACD\t\t\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = \"[Trewhiddle] style has long been recognised as a defining characteristic of much of the ornamental metalwork dated to the 9th century .... During the course of the 9th century, and arguably into the 10th, the Trewhiddle style enjoyed unrivalled prominence in the decoration of high-class metalwork and on the evidence of frequent attempts to copy its motifs in cheaper metals, it was a fashion to which most of the populace aspired.\"\n|salign    = right\n|source=\u2014 ''Gabor Thomas'', 2000.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=71}}}}\n\n==Style features== \nThe Trewhiddle style is recognized for its intricately carved decoration, including animal, plant, interlace and geometric patterns; [[Niello|niello]] inlays, densely decorated surfaces, and dome-headed rivets. A defining feature is the dividing of the main area of decoration into small panels, typically separated by beaded borders. Panels usually contain a single motif, typically a crouching, backward-looking or biting animal.{{sfn|Wilson|1961|pp=104-105}} Speckling of individual motifs was a technique frequently used to create surface texture or movement.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=72}}\n\nThe animal forms are many, including variations of mythical birds, snakes and beasts, usually depicted in profile. Plant motifs vary from intricately carved individual leaves to complete plants, often combined with animal forms and interlace.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=71}} Interlace is more commonly seen combined with zoomorphic and plant motifs, rather than on its own. When used singly, the interlace pattern is typically simple and closed. When used with plant or animal forms, the decoration is generally a more complex design.{{sfn|Thomas|2000|p=72}}\n\n==Metalwork== \nTrewhiddle style was primarily used to decorate metalwork. During the late Anglo-Saxon era, [[Silver|silver]] was the [[precious metal]] most commonly used to create Trewhiddle style jewellery and to decorate weapons. [[Vikings|Viking]] trade and expansion  during the ninth and tenth centuries brought new supplies of silver from the [[Near East]] to England and [[Scandinavia]]. The rapid change from the use of gold to silver in metalwork manufacturing, was due to abundant new supplies of silver that were made available to craftsmen during this time period. Subsequently, gold became the preferred metal to manufacture finger-rings or for gilding and inlay.{{sfn|Tait|1986|p=112}}  \n\n===Weapons=== \n[[File:Sword_Pommel_from_the_Bedale_Hoard_YORYM_2014_149_1-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bedale Hoard]] sword pommel]] \nTrewhiddle was a commonly used decoration style for late Anglo-Saxon swords. [[The Abingdon Sword|The Abingdon sword]], found near the village of  [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] and now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], is decorated with silver mounts inlaid with [[Niello|niello]]. The [[River Witham sword]], has a silver Trewhiddle style hilt is decorated with animal motifs, inlaid with niello.{{sfn|Davidson|1998|p=69}}  \n\nThe sword pommel from the [[Bedale Hoard]], is engraved with panels of gold foil inlay, and decorated with carved, intertwined animals and an intricate gold leaf pattern.

The H\u00f8ven hilt is decorated with intertwined bird and animal forms, similar in style to the [[Fuller Brooch]].{{sfn|Davidson|1998|p=70}}\n\n===Jewellery=== \n[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 005-crop.jpg|Pentney Hoard brooch|thumb|right|Pentney Hoard brooch]] \n\nAnglo-Saxon jewellery during the ninth and early tenth century is renowned for its superb craftsmanship and animated, intricately carved designs.

The circular brooch illustrates the embodiment of the Five Senses.
