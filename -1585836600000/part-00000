Hall]] from Congress after Hall was named U. N. Special Envoy for Hunger Issues by President [[George W. Bush]]. Earlier that year, Turner won the Republican nomination when he decisively defeated Roy Brown with 80% of the vote. Brown was the son and grandson of a former area Republican Congressmen [[Bud Brown (politician)|Bud Brown]] and [[Clarence J. Brown]] and operated a local newspaper company named Brown Publishing. In the general election, Turner defeated Congressman Tony Hall\u2019s chief of staff, Rick Carne, after Carne won the nomination to succeed his former boss.  Turner got a substantial assist from the 2000s round of redistricting.  The old [[Ohio's 7th congressional district|7th]] had been a fairly compact district centered on Dayton.  However, redistricting added some Republican-leaning suburbs to the east.\n\n===2004===\nIn [[United States House elections, 2004|2004]], Turner defeated former businesswoman Jane Mitakides with over 62% of the vote. The district was considered a key area in the swing state of Ohio in that year\u2019s presidential race.\n\n===2006===\nIn [[United States House elections, 2006|2006]], the Democrats planned to target Turner for defeat. Three Democrats entered the Third District Primary to run against Turner in the general election. [[Veterinarian]] Stephanie Studebaker defeated local bankruptcy attorney David Fierst and recalled Waynesville Mayor Charles W. Sanders. Studebaker had previously affiliated with former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean|Howard Dean\u2019s]] Presidential campaign in Ohio during the 2004 race. After winning the nomination, Studebaker and her husband Sam were both arrested for domestic violence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcnewsnet.com/main.asp?SectionID=15&SubSectionID=260&ArticleID=141279&TM=71415.87 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194854/http://www.tcnewsnet.com/main.asp?SectionID=15&SubSectionID=260&ArticleID=141279&TM=71415.87 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref> Studebaker subsequently dropped out of the race citing her family concerns and impending legal issues.  Following Studebaker\u2019s withdrawal, four Democrats entered a special election primary to face Turner, eventually settling on former Assistant [[United States Attorney]] Richard Chema. Turner defeated Chema with 58% of the vote.\n\n===2008===\n{{See also|2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio#District 3}}\nJane Mitakides beat Sanders in a primary in 2008 and faced Turner in a rematch from 2004. Turner again focused largely on economic issues of job creation and protection for workers impacted by the national and regional recession. In a difficult political climate for Republicans, Turner defeated Mitakides with 64% of the vote, his largest margin of victory in any election.\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio#District 3}}\nTurner was challenged by first time Democratic nominee 25 year old Joe Roberts in the general election and won with 68 percent of the vote.\n\n===2012===\n{{See also|2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio#District 10}}\nAfter redistricting, Turner's district was renumbered as the [[Ohio's 10th congressional district|10th district]].

With the declaration of the  [[Soviet-Japanese War]], the [[Soviet Union]] occupied the north of [[Korea]], and the [[United States]] occupied the south, with the boundary between their zones being the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].\n\nWith the onset of the [[Cold War]], negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to lead to an independent and unified Korean state. In 1948, [[1948 South Korean Constitutional Assembly election|UN-supervised elections]] were held in the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|US-occupied south]] only. The American-backed [[Syngman Rhee]] won the election while [[Kim Il-sung]] was appointed as the leader of North Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea, which was promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula. \n\nIn 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, North Korea invaded South Korea in attempt to unify the peninsula under its communist rule. The subsequent [[Korean War]], which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a [[Korean Armistice Agreement|stalemate]] and has left the two Koreas separated by the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) up to the present day.  \n\nOn April 27, 2018, during the [[April 2018 inter-Korean summit|2018 Inter-Korean Summit]], the [[Panmunjom Declaration]] for Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula was adopted between the [[Supreme Leader of North Korea]], [[Kim Jong-un]], and the [[President of South Korea]], [[Moon Jae-in]].  Later that same year, following the [[September 2018 inter-Korean summit|September Inter-Korean Summit]], several actions were taken toward reunification along the border, such as the dismantling of guard posts and the creation of buffer zones to prevent clashes.  On 12 December 2018, soldiers from both Koreas crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) into the opposition countries for the first time in history.<ref name=cbsnewsdec12>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-south-korea-troops-cross-demilitarized-zone-in-peace-first-time/|title=Troops cross North-South Korea Demilitarized Zone in peace for 1st time ever|website=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=ecdec12>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/north-and-south-korean-soldiers-enter-each-others-territory/north-invades-the-south/slideshow/67057861.cms|title=North and South Korean soldiers enter each other's territory|website=The Economic Times|accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n===Japanese rule (1910\u20131945)===\n{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}\nWhen the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended in 1905 Korea became a nominal [[protectorate]] of Japan, and was annexed by Japan in 1910.

With the declaration of the  [[Soviet-Japanese War]], the [[Soviet Union]] occupied the north of [[Korea]], and the [[United States]] occupied the south, with the boundary between their zones being the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].\n\nWith the onset of the [[Cold War]], negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to lead to an independent and unified Korean state. In 1948, [[1948 South Korean Constitutional Assembly election|UN-supervised elections]] were held in the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|US-occupied south]] only. The American-backed [[Syngman Rhee]] won the election while [[Kim Il-sung]] was appointed as the leader of North Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea, which was promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula. \n\nIn 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, North Korea invaded South Korea in attempt to unify the peninsula under its communist rule. The subsequent [[Korean War]], which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a [[Korean Armistice Agreement|stalemate]] and has left the two Koreas separated by the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) up to the present day.  \n\nOn April 27, 2018, during the [[April 2018 inter-Korean summit|2018 Inter-Korean Summit]], The [[Panmunjom Declaration]] for Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula was adopted between the [[Supreme Leader of North Korea]], [[Kim Jong-un]], and the [[President of South Korea]], [[Moon Jae-in]].  Later that same year, following the [[September 2018 inter-Korean summit|September Inter-Korean Summit]], several actions were taken toward reunification along the border, such as the dismantling of guard posts and the creation of buffer zones to prevent clashes.  On 12 December 2018, soldiers from both Koreas crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) into the opposition countries for the first time in history.<ref name=cbsnewsdec12>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-south-korea-troops-cross-demilitarized-zone-in-peace-first-time/|title=Troops cross North-South Korea Demilitarized Zone in peace for 1st time ever|website=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=ecdec12>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/north-and-south-korean-soldiers-enter-each-others-territory/north-invades-the-south/slideshow/67057861.cms|title=North and South Korean soldiers enter each other's territory|website=The Economic Times|accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n===Japanese rule (1910\u20131945)===\n{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}\nWhen the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended in 1905 Korea became a nominal [[protectorate]] of Japan, and was annexed by Japan in 1910.

The United Nations intervened to protect the South, sending a US-led force. As it occupied the south, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea attempted to unify Korea under its regime, initiating the nationalisation of industry, land reform, and the restoration of the People's Committees.<ref>{{cite book | title = Korea since 1850 | last1 = Lone |  first1 = Stewart| last2 = McCormack | first2 = Gavan | authorlink2 = Gavan McCormack | publisher = Longman Cheshire | location = Melbourne | year = 1993 | p=112 }}</ref>\n\nWhile UN intervention was conceived as restoring the border at the 38th parallel, Syngman Rhee argued that the attack of the North had obliterated the boundary.
