Ben dives in after them, and although Ryn escapes, Ian is trapped by the time Ben reaches him. Ben frees him and they return to the surface. Two weeks later, Ian makes public his footage of Ryn, forcing Ben and Maddie to try to get her out of the town. Two months later, Bristol Cove is under martial law. The military is preventing outsiders from entering, while only allowing access to its citizens. Ben and Maddie are wanted as the military continues to search for Ryn, who has now been out of the water for more than two months. As Ben and Maddie hide Ryn before she can be captured, the military apprehend Helen and the other human/merperson hybrids. Trackers were implanted in them after Beth and some prisoners tried to break out and were shot. They were also experimented upon to see how fast they heal. Xander and Calvin use a lure with a transmission of Donna's screams on it to capture a mermaid, who turns out to be Cami. She is tranquilized and sold to a collector. Having to go off-road to avoid a checkpoint on their route to the Canadian border, Ben, Maddie and Ryn hide out in a cabin as they wait for nightfall. Later that night, the military arrives with Ted and Sheriff Bishop. Although Ted tries to persuade Ben to give Ryn up, Ben takes him hostage to attempt an escape, only for a sniper to fire his gun, inadvertently hitting Maddie. As Ben and Ryn are restrained, Sheriff Bishop tries to save Maddie, but she dies in his arms.\n\nIt is then revealed that all of this was a flashforward - experienced by Ben in the seconds prior to rescuing Ian - to a probable outcome of saving him. He instead decides to leave Ian and returns to the surface alone, later claiming to Maddie that he couldn't save him. The newspaper lists Ian's death as an accident. Helen claims that he got what he deserved, since due to his interference, Ryn's embryo could not be implanted. Ted continues to have confusing memories from the night of the boat accident ten years previously, and Sheriff Bishop agrees to try to obtain the coast guard's report from the incident. The embryo that belonged to Ryn and her mate was instead implanted into Meredith to grant Bryan and Leela a full-blood merperson child of their own. Ben lies in bed, haunted by his decision to leave Ian to drown in order to protect the diminishing existence of the merpeople as well as the human/merpeople hybrids.\n |LineColor       = 1B2A36\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2020)===\n{{Episode table |background=#005F6C |overall=5 |season=5 |title=17 |director=11 |writer=27 |airdate=10 |viewers=9 |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 27\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Borders\n |DirectedBy      = [[Joe Menendez]]\n |WrittenBy       = Eric Wald\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |Viewers         = 0.51<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-thursday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-2-2020.html}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

Ryn's older sister and Chris, a crew member and fisherman on board Bristol Cove's well-known fishing boat ''the North Star'', were captured by the military. When Ryn unexpectedly requires marine biologist Ben Powell and his girlfriend Madeline \"Maddie\" Bishop's aid to help her find her sister.

At the Military lab, tests are being conducted using Ryn's sister's stem cells and they come upon a frightening conclusion that the mermaids are not all what they appear to be. Ben shows Maddie the video footage recorded in the seal den where he dived in the water to save Ryn but was met with her violence instead.

Ben dives in after them, and although Ryn escapes, Ian is trapped by the time Ben reaches him. Ben frees him and they return to the surface. Two weeks later, Ian makes public his footage of Ryn, forcing Ben and Maddie to try to get her out of the town. Two months later, Bristol Cove is under martial law. The military is preventing outsiders from entering, while only allowing access to its citizens. Ben and Maddie are wanted as the military continues to search for Ryn, who has now been out of the water for more than two months. As Ben and Maddie hide Ryn before she can be captured, the military apprehend Helen and the other human/merperson hybrids. Trackers were implanted in them after Beth and some prisoners tried to break out and were shot. They were also experimented upon to see how fast they heal. Xander and Calvin use a lure with a transmission of Donna's screams on it to capture a mermaid, who turns out to be Cami. She is tranquilized and sold to a collector. Having to go off-road to avoid a checkpoint on their route to the Canadian border, Ben, Maddie and Ryn hide out in a cabin as they wait for nightfall. Later that night, the military arrives with Ted and Sheriff Bishop. Although Ted tries to persuade Ben to give Ryn up, Ben takes him hostage to attempt an escape, only for a sniper to fire his gun, inadvertently hitting Maddie. As Ben and Ryn are restrained, Sheriff Bishop tries to save Maddie, but she dies in his arms.\n\nIt is then revealed that all of this was a flashforward - experienced by Ben in the seconds prior to rescuing Ian - to a probable outcome of saving him. He instead decides to leave Ian and returns to the surface alone, later claiming to Maddie that he couldn't save him. The newspaper lists Ian's death as an accident. Helen claims that he got what he deserved, since due to his interference, Ryn's embryo could not be implanted. Ted continues to have confusing memories from the night of the boat accident ten years previously, and Sheriff Bishop agrees to try to obtain the coast guard's report from the incident. The embryo that belonged to Ryn and her mate was instead implanted into Meredith to grant Bryan and Leela a full-blood merperson child of their own. Ben lies in bed, haunted by his decision to leave Ian to drown in order to protect the diminishing existence of the merpeople as well as the human/merpeople hybrids.\n |LineColor       = 1B2A36\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2020)===\n{{Episode table |background=#005F6C |overall=5 |season=5 |title=17 |director=11 |writer=27 |airdate=10 |viewers=9 |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 27\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Borders\n |DirectedBy      = [[Joe Menendez]]\n |WrittenBy       = Eric Wald\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |Viewers         = \n |ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.
