''Episcopos'' means literally ''overseer'' and describes the function of the elder, rather than the maturity of the officer. A [[bishop]] holds the highest office of the church (there is no Patriarch or Pope over bishops).\n* Preaching (the ministry of the Word) and the administration of the sacraments is ordinarily entrusted to specially trained elders (known as ministers of the Word and [[Sacrament]],<ref name=\"form1645\" /> sometimes called \"teaching elders\") in each local [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]], approved for these tasks by a governing presbytery, or classis, and called by the local congregation.\n* In addition to these ministers, there are also \"others \u2026 with gifts for government \u2026 commonly call[ed] \"elders\"<ref name=\"form1645\" /> or \"ruling elders\" (but not in the sense of \"''presbyteros''\").\n* Pastoral care, [[church discipline]], leadership and legislation are committed to the care of ruling assemblies of presbyters among whom the ministers and \"ruling elders\" are equal participants.\n* All Christian people together are the priesthood (see [[priesthood of all believers]]), on behalf of whom the elders are called to serve by the consent of the congregation.\n\n[[Presbyterianism]] uses a conciliar method of church government (that is, leadership by the group or council). Thus, the presbyters and \"elders\" govern together as a group, and at all times the office is for the service of the congregation, to pray for them and to encourage them in the faith.

However, sometimes it is admitted that episcopacy was a form of government that was used very early in the church for practical reasons.\n\nPresbyterianism is also distinct from [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]], in that individual congregations are not independent, but are answerable to the wider church, through its governing bodies (presbyteries, synods and assemblies). Moreover, the ordained ministry possesses a distinct responsibility for preaching and sacraments. [[Congregational church]]es are sometimes called \"Presbyterian\" if they are governed by a council of elders; but the difference is that every local congregation is independent, and its elders are accountable to its members, and congregationalism's wider assemblies are not ordinarily empowered to enforce discipline.

The terms 'lay' and 'clergy' are not properly used in presbyterian polity.\n\nMinisters may be considered equal in status with the other elders, but they have a distinct ordination and distinct function. They are the primary preachers and teachers, celebrants of sacraments. There are sometimes further distinctions between the minister and the other elders. Some Presbyterian denominations enroll ministers as members of their respective congregations, while others enroll the minister as a member of the regional presbytery. The presbyteries are responsible for the ordination of the ministers.\n\nUntil the 20th century, only men had been eligible for ordination as elders or ministers of the word and sacrament.\nThis is widely not the case any longer, although it is usually considered a demarcation issue, distinguishing \"liberal\" from \"conservative\" Presbyterian denominations. In North America, the [[Reformed Church in America]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] (both of Dutch Reformed heritage), [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]], [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States)|Evangelical Presbyterian Church]], [[ECO (denomination)|ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians]], [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] and [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] are denominations with presbyterian polity which allow for the ordination of women.\n\nThe general assembly of a denomination often decides on what grounds a person may be ordained, but the ordination of ministers is the right of the presbytery or classis,\nand the right to extend a call to a minister is the privilege of the members of the parish or congregation.\n<ref name=\"form1645\" />\n<ref name=\"ce\" />\n<ref>As an example of qualifications for office as teaching elder, many denominations require a period of theological education at university level.</ref>\n\n===Deacon===\n\nThe office of [[deacon]] has different meanings among different presbyterian churches. In some churches, deacons exercise responsibility for practical matters of finance and fabric, either separately or together with the elders.\nIn some cases deacons administer the welfare matters of the congregation, while a separate board of management or [[trustee]]s administers the other material business of the congregation, such as its endowments, salaries and buildings.\n\n==Governing bodies==\n\n===Session===\n{{main|Session (Presbyterian)}}\n\nElders make decisions for the local parish through an elected council called the ''Session'' ([[Latin]]. ''sessio'' from ''sedere'' \"to sit\"), sometimes the ''Kirk session'', ''church session,'' or (in [[Continental Reformed church|Continental Reformed]] usage) ''consistory''. The members of the session are the pastor(s) of that congregation (sometimes referred to as a teaching elder) and the installed ruling or canon elders (''ruling'' or ''canon'' because they are responsible for ''measuring'' the spiritual life and work of a congregation). In some Continental Reformed churches, deacons are members of the consistory; others, such as the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]], distinguish between the consistory, comprising the pastor and elders, and the council, which comprises the pastor(s), the elders, and the deacons.<ref>Christian Reformed Church of North America Church Order Article 35 a-b(2015)</ref>\n\nIn most denominations the pastor serves as Moderator and presides over the session ([[primus inter pares]]), in which all elders have an equal vote.<ref name=\"miller\" />{{rp|at=Chapter 9}} In some denominations, the pastor is not given a vote; however, in a sitting body of an even number or with a [[quorum]] of the session counted they can break a tie by a casting vote.\n\nIn the Polity of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the pastor and associate pastor(s) have votes as members of the session on any and all matters;<ref>PCUSA Book of Order G-10.0101</ref> however, often they refrain from voting except in tie situations. The Pastor is not a voting member of the congregation.<ref>PCUSA Book of Order G-7.0308</ref>\n\nWith the Session there is one person, usually an elder but not always, who will be given the title, \"Clerk of Session.\"  This person is more or less the secretary for Session. They take notes on each meeting and are responsible for records of the congregation. In addition they find a wide area of responsibility, including responsibility for conduct of worship should a minister suddenly not be available. \nAlthough it is the responsibility of the Moderator (minister), Session Clerks often have the ability to assist in keeping meetings on track due to skills which are received from experience and the Holy Spirit.\n\n===Presbytery===\n[[File:Presbytery flags.jpg|thumb|320px|Presbytery flags of the [[Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu]]]] \nIn presbyterianism, congregations are united in accountability to a regional body called the ''presbytery, ''or, in Continental Reformed terminology, the ''classis'', which comes from the Latin word for \"fleet.\" Presbyteries are made up of the minister and an elder 'commissioned' from each parish, as well as other clergy, such as theological college professors, chaplains, and retired ministers. When there is a larger number of ordained ministers than ruling elders, additional ruling elders are appointed to redress the imbalance. The commissioners of the presbytery are expected to exercise their own judgement and are not required to represent the majority view of their congregations. In some Dutch Reformed bodies, a classis serves as a delegated body, which ceases to exist in between meetings, whereas a presbytery exists perpetually.\n\nThe officers of a presbytery are a [[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland#Moderators|moderator]] and a [[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland#Clerks|stated or principal clerk]]. The moderator acts as chair of presbytery meetings and has a casting, but not deliberative, vote. As with the moderators of synods and assemblies, the moderatorship is a [[primus inter pares]] position appointed by the presbytery itself. The moderator is addressed as \"moderator\" during meetings, but their position has no bearing outside of the presbytery meeting and affords him/her no special place in other courts, although typically the moderator (especially if a member of the clergy) will conduct worship and oversee ordinations and installations of ministers as a \"liturgical\" bishop, and other ordinances which are seen as acts of the presbytery.\n\nThe stated or principal clerk takes minutes and deals with the correspondence of the presbytery, and is often appointed for an indefinite term. Presbytery Clerks are the ecclesiastical administrators and generally regarded as substantially influential due to their greater experience of the governance of the church and their ordering of the business of the presbytery. They are thus very much more than secretaries and often in fact are the lynch pin of the organisation.\n\nPresbyteries meet at a regularity between monthly and quarterly, some half-yearly.\n\n===Synod===\nIn denominations too large for all the work of the denomination to be done by a single presbytery, the parishes may be divided into several presbyteries under ''synods'' and ''general assemblies'', the synod being the lower court of the two. In the [[United Church of Canada]], this is referred to as \"conferences\" and \"General Council.\" However, the United Church of Canada does not bear the formal ecclesiastical structure of classic Presbyterianism.\n\nOften all members of the constituent presbyteries are members of the synod. Like the commissioners to presbyteries, the commissioners to synods do not act on instruction from their congregations or presbyteries, but exercise their own judgement. A synod also has a moderator and clerk, and generally meet less often than the presbytery.\n\nSome presbyterian churches, like the [[Church of Scotland]], [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]] and [[Presbyterian Church in America]] have no intermediate court between the presbytery and the general assembly.\n\n===General assembly===\nThe ''general assembly'' (or [[General Synod|general synod]]) is the highest court of presbyterian polity. Each presbytery selects a number of its members to be commissioners to the general assembly. The general assembly is chaired by its own [[Moderator of the General Assembly|moderator]], who is usually elected to a single term. He or she is addressed as moderator during meetings, but like the other moderators, their position has no bearing outside of the assembly meeting and affords him/her no special place in other courts. He or she presides over meetings of the assembly, and may be called on in a representative function for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe stated clerk and deputy clerk of the general assembly administer the minutes, correspondence, and business of the assembly. In some cases a separate business convenor is appointed to deal with the agenda. General assemblies meet less regularly than their subordinate courts, often annually, or in the case of the Presbyterian Church (USA), every other year.\n\nThe General Assembly also has members serve as Advisory Delegates. There are four different types of advisory delegates, each with a focus on a different area in the Presbyterian Church like young adult, theological student, missionary and ecumenical. The role of an advisory delegate is to speak about issues or topics that commissioners would usually not worry about or care to speak about during a General Assembly meeting. Advisory Delegates may not present motions or vote in meetings of the General Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcusa.org/site_media/media/uploads/oga/pdf/ga221/221st_general_assembly_yaad_information.pdf|title=General Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe powers of the general assembly are usually wide-ranging. However, they may be limited by some form of external review. For example, the rules of the [[Church of Scotland]] include the [[Barrier Act]], which requires that certain major changes to the polity of the church be referred to the presbyteries, before being enacted by the general assembly.\n\nThere may be issues arising between annual General Assemblies which require urgent attention. In these cases some presbyterian churches have a 'commission of assembly' who will deal with the issue and refer it to the next General Assembly for homologation.\n\n== Regions ==\n{{see also|Presbyterianism#Regions}}\n\n=== British Isles ===\n\nThe word ''[[Presbyterianism]]'', when capitalized, often refers specifically to churches founded on principles of presbyterian polity in the [[British Isles]] and their derivatives in other countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benedict |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Benedict |title=Christ's Churches Purely Reformed: A Social History of Calvinism |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0300105070 |page=xiv}}\n</ref>\n\n=== France ===\n\n[[Image:Croix huguenote.svg|thumb|160px|right|[[Huguenot cross|Huguenot Cross]]]]\n\nIn [[France]], presbyterianism was represented by the [[Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France]].

The logo is a [[Huguenot]] Cross (''Croix Huguenote'') with the burning bush.\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nThe origins of the [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]] lie in the medieval Waldensian movement for religious reform. The [[Waldensians]] adopted Calvinist theology during the Reformation and became the Italian branch of the Reformed churches.

Again, Miller (1831) explains,\n<ref name=\"miller\" />{{rp|at=Chapter 9}}\n\n{{quote|It is their duty to have an eye of inspection and care over all the members of the congregation; and, for this purpose, to cultivate a universal and intimate acquaintance, as far as may be, with every family in the flock of which they are made \"overseers\".}}\n\n===Minister===\n{{See also|Holy Orders#Presbyterian churches}}\n\nIn some denominations they are called ''Ministers of Word and Sacrament'', and in others they are called ''Teaching Elders''. Ministers called to a particular congregation are called ''[[pastor]]s'', and serve a function analogous to [[clergy]] in other denominations.<ref name=\"form1645\">Westminster Assembly, 1645A ''\"[[The Form of Presbyterial Church Government|The Form of Presbyterial Church-Government]]\"'' (ASSEMBLY AT EDINBURGH, February 10, 1645, Sess. 16.\nACT of the GENERAL ASSEMBLY of the KIRK of SCOTLAND, approving the Propositions\nconcerning Kirk-government, and Ordination of Ministers). Online at [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_standards/index.html?mainframe=/documents/wcf_standards/p395-form_presby_gov.html CRTA], retrieved on September 6, 2006.</ref> (Because ruling elders are often ordained in a fashion nearly identical to teaching elders, the distinction between lay and clergy is not as clear under the Presbyterian system as in others.<ref name=\"miller\" />). The terms 'lay' and 'clergy' are not properly used in presbyterian polity.\n\nMinisters may be considered equal in status with the other elders, but they have a distinct ordination and distinct function. They are the primary preachers and teachers, celebrants of sacraments. There are sometimes further distinctions between the minister and the other elders. Some Presbyterian denominations enroll ministers as members of their respective congregations, while others enroll the minister as a member of the regional presbytery. The presbyteries are responsible for the ordination of the ministers.\n\nUntil the 20th century, only men had been eligible for ordination as elders or ministers of the word and sacrament.\nThis is widely not the case any longer, although it is usually considered a demarcation issue, distinguishing \"liberal\" from \"conservative\" Presbyterian denominations. In North America, the [[Reformed Church in America]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] (both of Dutch Reformed heritage), [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]], [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States)|Evangelical Presbyterian Church]], [[ECO (denomination)|ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians]], [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] and [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] are denominations with presbyterian polity which allow for the ordination of women.\n\nThe general assembly of a denomination often decides on what grounds a person may be ordained, but the ordination of ministers is the right of the presbytery or classis,\nand the right to extend a call to a minister is the privilege of the members of the parish or congregation.\n<ref name=\"form1645\" />\n<ref name=\"ce\" />\n<ref>As an example of qualifications for office as teaching elder, many denominations require a period of theological education at university level.</ref>\n\n===Deacon===\n\nThe office of [[deacon]] has different meanings among different presbyterian churches. In some churches, deacons exercise responsibility for practical matters of finance and fabric, either separately or together with the elders.\nIn some cases deacons administer the welfare matters of the congregation, while a separate board of management or [[trustee]]s administers the other material business of the congregation, such as its endowments, salaries and buildings.\n\n==Governing bodies==\n\n===Session===\n{{main|Session (Presbyterian)}}\n\nElders make decisions for the local parish through an elected council called the ''Session'' ([[Latin]]. ''sessio'' from ''sedere'' \"to sit\"), sometimes the ''Kirk session'', ''church session,'' or (in [[Continental Reformed church|Continental Reformed]] usage) ''consistory''. The members of the session are the pastor(s) of that congregation (sometimes referred to as a teaching elder) and the installed ruling or canon elders (''ruling'' or ''canon'' because they are responsible for ''measuring'' the spiritual life and work of a congregation). In some Continental Reformed churches, deacons are members of the consistory; others, such as the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]], distinguish between the consistory, comprising the pastor and elders, and the council, which comprises the pastor(s), the elders, and the deacons.<ref>Christian Reformed Church of North America Church Order Article 35 a-b(2015)</ref>\n\nIn most denominations the pastor serves as Moderator and presides over the session ([[primus inter pares]]), in which all elders have an equal vote.<ref name=\"miller\" />{{rp|at=Chapter 9}} In some denominations, the pastor is not given a vote; however, in a sitting body of an even number or with a [[quorum]] of the session counted they can break a tie by a casting vote.\n\nIn the Polity of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the pastor and associate pastor(s) have votes as members of the session on any and all matters;<ref>PCUSA Book of Order G-10.0101</ref> however, often they refrain from voting except in tie situations. The Pastor is not a voting member of the congregation.<ref>PCUSA Book of Order G-7.0308</ref>\n\nWith the Session there is one person, usually an elder but not always, who will be given the title, \"Clerk of Session.\"  This person is more or less the secretary for Session. They take notes on each meeting and are responsible for records of the congregation. In addition they find a wide area of responsibility, including responsibility for conduct of worship should a minister suddenly not be available. \nAlthough it is the responsibility of the Moderator (minister), Session Clerks often have the ability to assist in keeping meetings on track due to skills which are received from experience and the Holy Spirit.\n\n===Presbytery===\n[[File:Presbytery flags.jpg|thumb|320px|Presbytery flags of the [[Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu]]]] \nIn presbyterianism, congregations are united in accountability to a regional body called the ''presbytery, ''or, in Continental Reformed terminology, the ''classis'', which comes from the Latin word for \"fleet.\" Presbyteries are made up of the minister and an elder 'commissioned' from each parish, as well as other clergy, such as theological college professors, chaplains, and retired ministers. When there is a larger number of ordained ministers than ruling elders, additional ruling elders are appointed to redress the imbalance. The commissioners of the presbytery are expected to exercise their own judgement and are not required to represent the majority view of their congregations. In some Dutch Reformed bodies, a classis serves as a delegated body, which ceases to exist in between meetings, whereas a presbytery exists perpetually.\n\nThe officers of a presbytery are a [[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland#Moderators|moderator]] and a [[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland#Clerks|stated or principal clerk]]. The moderator acts as chair of presbytery meetings and has a casting, but not deliberative, vote. As with the moderators of synods and assemblies, the moderatorship is a [[primus inter pares]] position appointed by the presbytery itself. The moderator is addressed as \"moderator\" during meetings, but their position has no bearing outside of the presbytery meeting and affords him/her no special place in other courts, although typically the moderator (especially if a member of the clergy) will conduct worship and oversee ordinations and installations of ministers as a \"liturgical\" bishop, and other ordinances which are seen as acts of the presbytery.\n\nThe stated or principal clerk takes minutes and deals with the correspondence of the presbytery, and is often appointed for an indefinite term. Presbytery Clerks are the ecclesiastical administrators and generally regarded as substantially influential due to their greater experience of the governance of the church and their ordering of the business of the presbytery. They are thus very much more than secretaries and often in fact are the lynch pin of the organisation.\n\nPresbyteries meet at a regularity between monthly and quarterly, some half-yearly.\n\n===Synod===\nIn denominations too large for all the work of the denomination to be done by a single presbytery, the parishes may be divided into several presbyteries under ''synods'' and ''general assemblies'', the synod being the lower court of the two. In the [[United Church of Canada]], this is referred to as \"conferences\" and \"General Council.\" However, the United Church of Canada does not bear the formal ecclesiastical structure of classic Presbyterianism.\n\nOften all members of the constituent presbyteries are members of the synod. Like the commissioners to presbyteries, the commissioners to synods do not act on instruction from their congregations or presbyteries, but exercise their own judgement. A synod also has a moderator and clerk, and generally meet less often than the presbytery.\n\nSome presbyterian churches, like the [[Church of Scotland]], [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]] and [[Presbyterian Church in America]] have no intermediate court between the presbytery and the general assembly.\n\n===General assembly===\nThe ''general assembly'' (or [[General Synod|general synod]]) is the highest court of presbyterian polity. Each presbytery selects a number of its members to be commissioners to the general assembly. The general assembly is chaired by its own [[Moderator of the General Assembly|moderator]], who is usually elected to a single term. He or she is addressed as moderator during meetings, but like the other moderators, their position has no bearing outside of the assembly meeting and affords him/her no special place in other courts. He or she presides over meetings of the assembly, and may be called on in a representative function for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe stated clerk and deputy clerk of the general assembly administer the minutes, correspondence, and business of the assembly. In some cases a separate business convenor is appointed to deal with the agenda. General assemblies meet less regularly than their subordinate courts, often annually, or in the case of the Presbyterian Church (USA), every other year.\n\nThe General Assembly also has members serve as Advisory Delegates. There are four different types of advisory delegates, each with a focus on a different area in the Presbyterian Church like young adult, theological student, missionary and ecumenical. The role of an advisory delegate is to speak about issues or topics that commissioners would usually not worry about or care to speak about during a General Assembly meeting. Advisory Delegates may not present motions or vote in meetings of the General Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcusa.org/site_media/media/uploads/oga/pdf/ga221/221st_general_assembly_yaad_information.pdf|title=General Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe powers of the general assembly are usually wide-ranging. However, they may be limited by some form of external review. For example, the rules of the [[Church of Scotland]] include the [[Barrier Act]], which requires that certain major changes to the polity of the church be referred to the presbyteries, before being enacted by the general assembly.\n\nThere may be issues arising between annual General Assemblies which require urgent attention. In these cases some presbyterian churches have a 'commission of assembly' who will deal with the issue and refer it to the next General Assembly for homologation.\n\n== Regions ==\n{{see also|Presbyterianism#Regions}}\n\n=== British Isles ===\n\nThe word ''[[Presbyterianism]]'', when capitalized, often refers specifically to churches founded on principles of presbyterian polity in the [[British Isles]] and their derivatives in other countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benedict |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Benedict |title=Christ's Churches Purely Reformed: A Social History of Calvinism |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0300105070 |page=xiv}}\n</ref>\n\n=== France ===\n\n[[Image:Croix huguenote.svg|thumb|160px|right|[[Huguenot cross|Huguenot Cross]]]]\n\nIn [[France]], presbyterianism was represented by the [[Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France]]. There are also Lutherans and Evangelicals. The logo is a [[Huguenot]] Cross (''Croix Huguenote'') with the burning bush.\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nThe origins of the [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]] lie in the medieval Waldensian movement for religious reform. The [[Waldensians]] adopted Calvinist theology during the Reformation and became the Italian branch of the Reformed churches. In 1975 the Waldensian Church joined with the Italian Methodist Church to form the [[Union of Waldensian and Methodist Churches]], which is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], and the [[World Methodist Council]].\n\n==Cultural influences==\n*[[Robert Burns]] published a brief irreverent poem, ''On A Celebrated Ruling Elder'', as an elegy for a Scottish Presbyterian.<ref>Burns, Robert.

To their surprise Cap has no idea what is happening. He tells them he was driving his grandmother, Rain, to the hospital after she broke her hip falling out of a tree. He lives with his Grandma and is schooled by her on a commune called Garland and neither understands the concept of a license nor knows the emergency number 9-1-1 Eventually, the police let him go to see Rain in the hospital. \n# \n# Rain is distraught. She tells the nurses that she cannot go to the hospital for two months because she has to look after Capricorn, who has no one else, and she hates the idea of him being \"contaminated\" by the real world. The doctors tell her she has no choice and they will have to call social services to find him a home and a school until she gets strong again. Luckily for both Cap and Rain, the social worker given Cap's case is a lady called Mrs. Donnelly. Brought up on Garland herself, she understands what Cap must be going through and invites him to stay with her at her house.\n# \n# Cap's first few days at Claverage Middle School (also called C Average by the students) are a nightmare. The first person he meets is Zach Powers, the school bully and popular kid at school. From his clothes and lack of social understanding, Zach can see Cap is the perfect target for him and his friends. The school has a tradition of voting the dorkiest kid in as president so eighth-graders like him can make fun of them and manipulate them to do as they please. The last two presidents had to leave school early due to nervous breakdowns. Zach views Cap as perfect president material.\n# \n# Cap tells Rain that he is not happy at his school. People are violent and have no time for anyone. He wants to go back to Garland. Rain is sympathetic. She tells him that the outside world is an unforgiving place and he should feel sorry for anyone that cannot love like he can. She also expresses guilt because she thinks she should have exposed Cap to the real world sooner.\n# \n# Cap is voted in as president. Everyone is happy, particularly Hugh Winkleman, an unpopular kid who knows it would have been him and not Cap who would have been voted in if Zach hadn't noticed Cap so soon. Zach and his friends Darryl, Naomi and Lena are having a great time sending Cap on wild goose chases. They send him to \"press conferences\" in rooms that don't exist, and Naomi leaves notes from \"Lorelei Lumley\" in his locker. One day Cap finds a dead bird in his locker. Upset, he takes it to the garden and buries it in the flowerbed. As he stands over the grave, he is joined by other children including Naomi, who has a crush on Zach but secretly wishes that he would show as much sensitivity as Cap. Zach gets angry at people's show of respect to the bird.\n# \n# Sadly, Cap's life at home is no better. Mrs. Donnelly's daughter Sophie hates him, even pouring water over his head when he practices tai-chi on the lawn outside. To Sophie, Cap is an embarrassment. Cap responds in his usual affable manner, but the abuse just continues. Mrs. Donnelly tells him Sophie is partly behaving so badly because of her father, Mrs. Donnelly's ex-husband, who is always making promises to her he can't keep, such as forgetting to help teach Sophie how to drive, which gives Cap an idea.\n# \n# Meanwhile, Cap's popularity at school rises two-fold. One day on the school bus, the bus driver has a heart attack, sending the bus veering towards a dump truck. Cap responds immediately, steering the bus away from the truck and to the hospital, where he is arrested. Despite his arrest at the hospital, the students hail him as a hero and begin helping him out with his duties as president. In particular, everyone is keen to help out with the Halloween dance, which is Cap's responsibility as president even though he has never been to a dance. Even the assistant principal, Frank Kasigi, gives him twelve blank checks to pay for everything. However, he tells Cap he must use the checks responsibly. Cap has no idea what he is talking about until he remembers what Rain once said to him: being responsible is helping others. Mr. Kasigi signs the checks before he gives them to Cap because he has to go out of town. With the checks Cap buys and engraves a bracelet for Sophie, pretending it is from her father and donates money to lots of charities, including $1000 to Naomi's \n# \n# The only two people unhappy with Cap's newfound celebrity status are Hugh and Zach. Despite hating each other, they decide to get together and plot Cap's downfall. At the pep rally, they dress Cap up in the opposing team's uniform and send him out onto the football field, and as soon as he steps onto the field the Claverage players all charge and pile onto him, with Darryl at the front. They only realize he is not a football player when his frail stature crumbles under their weight. Later, Darryl, realizing Zach was responsible, approaches him in the corridor. Zach laughs at him, and Darryl, unable to compete with him in an argument of words, raises his fists to punch him. Unfortunately, Cap has stepped between them without Darryl noticing, and his punch lands directly on Cap's nose. Zach uses this to his advantage.\n# \n# An ambulance arrives for Cap, but it is not to take him to a hospital. Rain has arrived at the school to take him back to Garland. Cap has mixed feelings. Though he misses Garland, he was beginning to enjoy his life at Claverage. When they arrive back at the commune, Cap feels a bit depressed. Compared to the outside world, Garland is very dull. Cap is torn between Claverage and Garland.\n# \n# Meanwhile, the students, putting two and two together, think Cap has died, blaming Zach and Hugh for his death. Zach is an outcast and now the victim of spitballs. The only person willing to sit with him at lunch is Hugh Winkleman. Both Zach and Hugh think they are ridiculous, but Zach knows that if he wants to get back his popular status, he needs to take advantage of the situation. With Hugh, he decides to arrange a memorial service for Cap in the school car parking lot.\n# \n# Sophie is doing her driving test when she realizes that the bracelet she thought her father sent her was not from him, but from Cap. She feels remorse about all the things she said and did to him, and all he did was respond in kindness. As soon as she passes her driving test she travels to Garland, determined to take Cap to the Halloween dance. Cap had the same idea and a few miles from the commune, they meet each other. In Sophie's car, they drive to Claverage Middle School.\n# \n# When they arrive at the school, Cap and Sophie are shocked to see everyone in the parking lot holding candles and dressed in hippie clothing. Before long they see Zach step onto the stage, asking people to come up to give their tributes to Cap - \"the best president C Average has ever had.\" One by one, they all tearfully give small speeches until finally Cap comes forward to reveal he is still alive. Everyone goes wild and Darryl steps forward to lift him through the crowd. At the back of the crowd is Rain, observing everything. Cap says goodbye to all 1,100 students individually at the end of the memorial service, because at the beginning of the year, Hugh said he had to know everyone's name to be president.\n# \n# A couple of days later, Cap is at working on the commune by himself when a white Mercedes pulls up and out steps Rain.
