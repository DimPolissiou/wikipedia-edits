Neruda became known as a poet when he was 13 years old, and wrote in a variety of styles, including [[surrealism|surrealist]] poems, historical epics, overtly political manifestos, a prose autobiography, and passionate love poems such as the ones in his collection ''[[Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair]]'' (1924). He won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1971.\n\nNeruda occupied many diplomatic positions in various countries during his lifetime and served a term as a Senator for the [[Chilean Communist Party]]. When President [[Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla]] [[Law of Permanent Defense of Democracy|outlawed communism]] in Chile in 1948, a warrant was issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months in the basement of a house in the port city of [[Valpara\u00edso]]; Neruda escaped through [[Lilpela Pass|a mountain pass]] near [[Maihue Lake]] into Argentina. Years later, Neruda was a close advisor to Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|socialist]] President [[Salvador Allende]].

On 18 July 1917, at the age of thirteen, he published his first work, an essay titled \"Entusiasmo y perseverancia\" (\"Enthusiasm and Perseverance\") in the local daily newspaper ''La Ma\u00f1ana'', and signed it Neftal\u00ed Reyes.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 19</ref> From 1918 to mid-1920, he published numerous poems, such as \"Mis ojos\" (\"My eyes\"), and essays in local magazines as Neftal\u00ed Reyes. In 1919, he participated in the literary contest Juegos Florales del Maule and won third place for his poem \"Comuni\u00f3n ideal\" or \"Nocturno ideal\". By mid-1920, when he adopted the pseudonym Pablo Neruda, he was a published author of poems, prose, and journalism. He is thought to have derived his pen name from the [[Czechs|Czech]] poet [[Jan Neruda]].<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/pablo-neruda-9421737 Pablo Neruda]. Biography.com.</ref> The young poet's intention in publishing under a pseudonym was to avoid his father's disapproval of his poems.\n\nIn 1921, at the age of 16, Neruda moved to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]<ref name=\"Tarn14\"/> to study [[French language|French]] at the [[Universidad de Chile]], with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, he was soon devoting all his time to writing poems and with the help of well-known writer [[Eduardo Barrios]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pablo-Neruda|title=Pablo Neruda {{!}} Chilean poet|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=23 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he managed to meet and impress Don Carlos George Nascimento, the most important publisher in Chile at the time. In 1923, his first volume of verse, ''Crepusculario'' (''Book of Twilights''), was published by Editorial Nascimento, followed the next year by ''[[Veinte poemas de amor y una canci\u00f3n desesperada]]'' (''Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song''),<ref name=\"Tarn14\"/> a collection of love poems that was controversial for its eroticism, especially considering its author's young age. Both works were critically acclaimed and have been translated into many languages. Over the decades, ''Veinte poemas'' sold millions of copies and became Neruda's best-known work, though a second edition did not appear until 1932. Almost one hundred years later, Veinte Poemas still retains its place as the best-selling poetry book in the Spanish language.<ref name=\"Tarn14\"/> By the age of 20, Neruda had established an international reputation as a poet, but faced poverty.<ref name=\"Tarn14\"/>\n\nIn 1926, he published the collection ''Tentativa del hombre infinito'' (''The Attempt of the Infinite Man'') and the novel ''El habitante y su esperanza'' (''The Inhabitant and His Hope'').<ref name=\"Tarn15\">Tarn (1975) p. 15</ref> In 1927, out of financial desperation, he took an honorary consulship in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the capital of the British colony of [[Myanmar|Burma]], then administered from [[New Delhi]] as a province of [[British India]].

During this period, Neruda slowly became estranged from his wife and began a relationship with {{Interlanguage link multi|Delia del Carril|es}}, an Argentine twenty years his senior.\n\n[[File:Graf van Malva Marina Reyes, Oude Begraafplaats, Gouda.jpg|thumb|Grave of Malva Marina, daughter of Pablo Neruda]]\nAs Spain became engulfed in [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], Neruda became intensely politicised for the first time. His experiences during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath moved him away from privately focused work in the direction of collective obligation. Neruda became an ardent [[Communism|Communist]] for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends, as well as that of del Carril, were contributing factors, but the most important catalyst was the execution of Garc\u00eda Lorca by forces loyal to the dictator [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''Espa\u00f1a en el coraz\u00f3n'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'', 1938). He lost his post as consul due to his political militancy.<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/>\n\nNeruda's marriage to Vogelzang broke down and Neruda eventually obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1943. His wife moved to [[Monte Carlo]] to escape the hostilities in Spain and then to the Netherlands with their only child, and he never saw either of them again.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 434</ref> After leaving his wife, Neruda lived with Delia del Carril in France, eventually marrying her (shortly after his divorce) in [[Tetecala]] in 1943.<ref>{{Mark Eisner : Pablo Neruda - The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 306</ref>\n\nFollowing the election of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], whom Neruda supported, as President of Chile in 1938, Neruda was appointed special consul for Spanish emigrants in Paris. There he was responsible for what he called \"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\": transporting 2,000 Spanish refugees who had been housed by the French in [[Concentration camps in France|squalid camps]] to Chile on an old ship called the ''[[Winnipeg (ship)|Winnipeg]]''.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 141</ref> Neruda is sometimes charged with having selected only fellow Communists for emigration, to the exclusion of others who had fought on the side of the Republic.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 145</ref> Many of these Republicans and Anarchists were killed during the German invasion and occupation. Others deny these accusations, pointing out that Neruda chose only a few hundred of the 2,000 refugees personally; the rest were selected by the Service for the Evacuation of Spanish Refugees set up by [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], President of the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish Republican Government in Exile]].\n\n===Mexican appointment===\n\nNeruda's next diplomatic post was as Consul General in [[Mexico City]] from 1940 to 1943.<ref name=\"Tarn17\">Tarn (1975) p. 17</ref> While he was there, he married del Carril, and learned that his daughter Malva had died, aged eight, in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/>\n\nIn 1940, after the failure of an assassination attempt against [[Leon Trotsky]], Neruda arranged a Chilean visa for the Mexican painter [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], who was accused of having been one of the conspirators in the assassination.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 340</ref> Neruda later said that he did it at the request of the Mexican President, [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]]. This enabled Siqueiros, then jailed, to leave Mexico for Chile, where he stayed in Neruda's private residence. In exchange for Neruda's assistance, Siqueiros spent over a year painting a mural in a school in [[Chill\u00e1n]]. Neruda's relationship with Siqueiros attracted criticism, but Neruda dismissed the allegation that his intent had been to help an assassin as \"sensationalist politico-literary harassment\".\n\n===Return to Chile===\n\nIn 1943, after his return to Chile, Neruda made a tour of [[Peru]], where he visited [[Machu Picchu]],<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 244</ref> an experience that later inspired [[The Heights of Macchu Picchu|''Alturas de Macchu Picchu'']], a book-length poem in twelve parts that he completed in 1945 and which expressed his growing awareness of, and interest in, the ancient civilizations of the Americas. He explored this theme further in ''[[Canto General]]'' (1950). In ''Alturas'', Neruda celebrated the achievement of Machu Picchu, but also condemned the slavery that had made it possible. In ''Canto XII'', he called upon the dead of many centuries to be born again and to speak through him. [[Mart\u00edn Espada]], poet and professor of creative writing at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has hailed the work as a masterpiece, declaring that \"there is no greater political poem\".\n\n===Communism===\n\nBolstered by his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, Neruda, like many left-leaning intellectuals of his generation, came to admire the [[Soviet Union]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], partly for the role it played in defeating [[Nazi Germany]] and partly because of an idealist interpretation of [[Marxist]] doctrine.<ref name=\"Feinstein\"/> This is echoed in poems such as \"Canto a Stalingrado\" (1942) and \"Nuevo canto de amor a Stalingrado\" (1943). In 1953, Neruda was awarded the [[Stalin Peace Prize]]. Upon Stalin's death that same year, Neruda wrote an ode to him, as he also wrote poems in praise of [[Fulgencio Batista]], \"Saludo a Batista\" (\"Salute to Batista\"), and later to [[Fidel Castro]]. His fervent Stalinism eventually drove a wedge between Neruda and his long-time friend [[Octavio Paz]], who commented that \"Neruda became more and more Stalinist, while I became less and less enchanted with Stalin.\"<ref>Roman, Joe. (1993)  ''Octavio Paz'' Chelsea House Publishers  {{ISBN|0-7910-1249-2}}</ref> Their differences came to a head after the Nazi-Soviet [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] of 1939, when they almost came to blows in an argument over Stalin. Although Paz still considered Neruda \"The greatest poet of his generation\", in an essay on [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] he wrote that when he thinks of \"Neruda and other famous Stalinist writers and poets, I feel the gooseflesh that I get from reading certain passages of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. No doubt they began in good faith [...] but insensibly, commitment by commitment, they saw themselves becoming entangled in a mesh of lies, falsehoods, deceits and perjuries, until they lost their souls.\"<ref>Paz, Octavio  (1991)  ''On Poets and Others''.

Anxious not to give ammunition to his ideological enemies, he would later refuse publicly to condemn the Soviet repression of dissident writers like [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Joseph Brodsky]], an attitude with which even some of his staunchest admirers disagreed.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 263</ref>\n\n{{Wikisource|I accuse (Neruda)|I Accuse}}\nOn 4 March 1945, Neruda was elected a Communist [[Senate of Chile|Senator]] for the northern provinces of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]] and [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] in the [[Atacama Desert]].<ref>Shull (2009) p. 69</ref><ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 181</ref> He officially joined the [[Communist Party of Chile]] four months later.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> In 1946, the Radical Party's presidential candidate, [[Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla]], asked Neruda to act as his campaign manager. Gonz\u00e1lez Videla was supported by a coalition of left-wing parties and Neruda fervently campaigned on his behalf. Once in office, however, Gonz\u00e1lez Videla turned against the Communist Party and issued the ''[[Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy|Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia]]'' (Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy). The breaking point for Senator Neruda was the violent repression of a Communist-led miners' strike in [[Lota, Chile|Lota]] in October 1947, when striking workers were herded into island military prisons and a [[Pisagua Prison Camp|concentration camp in the town of Pisagua]]. Neruda's criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez Videla culminated in a dramatic speech in the Chilean senate on 6 January 1948, which became known as \"Yo acuso\" (\"I accuse\"), in the course of which he read out the names of the miners and their families who were imprisoned at the concentration camp.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 199</ref>\n\nIn 1959 Neruda was present as [[Fidel Castro]] was honored at a welcoming ceremony offered by the [[Central University of Venezuela]] where he spoke to a massive gathering of students and read his [[Canto a Bolivar]]. Luis B\u00e1ez summarized what Neruda said: ''\"In this painful and victorious hour that the peoples of America live, my poem with changes of place, can be understood directed to Fidel Castro, because in the struggles for freedom the fate of a Man to give confidence to the spirit of greatness in the history of our peoples\".''\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was asked for his opinion of Pablo Neruda. Borges stated, \"I think of him as a very fine poet, a very fine poet. I don't admire him as a man, I think of him as a very mean man.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 95.</ref> He said that Neruda had not spoken out against Argentine President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] because he was afraid to risk his reputation, noting \"I was an Argentine poet, he was a Chilean poet, he's on the side of the Communists; I'm against them. So I felt he was behaving very wisely in avoiding a meeting that would have been quite uncomfortable for both of us.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Exile==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-10640-0020, Berlin, III.

Neruda later moved to [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], in southern Chile. From Valdivia he moved to ''Fundo Huishue'', a forestry estate in the vicinity of [[Huishue Lake]]. Neruda's life underground ended in March 1949 when he fled over the [[Lilpela Pass]] in the [[Andes Mountains]] to [[Argentina]] on horseback. He would dramatically recount his escape from Chile in his Nobel Prize lecture.\n\nOnce out of Chile, he spent the next three years in exile.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> In [[Buenos Aires]], Neruda took advantage of the slight resemblance between him and his friend, the future Nobel Prize-winning novelist and cultural attach\u00e9 to the [[Guatemala]]n embassy [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]], to travel to Europe using Asturias' passport.<ref name=\"Feinstein236\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 236\u20137</ref> [[Pablo Picasso]] arranged his entrance into [[Paris]] and Neruda made a surprise appearance there to a stunned World Congress of Peace Forces{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, while the Chilean government denied that the poet could have escaped the country.<ref name=\"Feinstein236\"/> Neruda spent those three years traveling extensively throughout Europe as well as taking trips to [[India]], [[China]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the Soviet Union. His trip to Mexico in late 1949 was lengthened due to a serious bout of [[phlebitis]].<ref name=\"Feinstein290\">Feinstein (2005) p. 290</ref> A Chilean singer named [[Matilde Urrutia]] was hired to care for him and they began an affair that would, years later, culminate in marriage.<ref name=\"Feinstein290\"/> During his exile, Urrutia would travel from country to country shadowing him and they would arrange meetings whenever they could. Matilde Urrutia was the muse for ''[[Los versos del capit\u00e1n]]'', a book of poetry which Neruda later published anonymously in 1952.\n\n{{Quote box  |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nfrom '''\"Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon\"'''\n\nFull woman, fleshly apple, hot moon,\nthick smell of seaweed, crushed mud and light,\nwhat obscure brilliance opens between your columns?\nWhat ancient night does a man touch with his senses?\n\nLoving is a journey with water and with stars,\nwith smothered air and abrupt storms of flour:\nloving is a clash of lightning-bolts\nand two bodies defeated by a single drop of honey.\n\n</poem>|source =From \"Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon\", <br />''Selected Poems'' translated by Stephen Mitchell (1997) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleharborbooks.com/book/9780061733574|title=Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon: Selected Poems of Pablo Neruda \u2013 Eagle Harbor Book Co.|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile in Mexico, Neruda also published his lengthy epic poem ''[[Canto General]]'', a [[Walt Whitman|Whitmanesque]] catalog of the history, geography, and flora and fauna of South America, accompanied by Neruda's observations and experiences. Many of them dealt with his time underground in Chile, which is when he composed much of the poem. In fact, he had carried the manuscript with him during his escape on horseback. A month later, a different edition of five thousand copies was boldly published in Chile by the outlawed Communist Party based on a manuscript Neruda had left behind. In Mexico, he was granted honorary Mexican citizenship.<ref name=\"Tarn22\">Tarn (1975) p. 22</ref> Neruda's 1952 stay in a villa owned by Italian historian [[Edwin Cerio]] on the island of [[Capri]] was fictionalized in [[Antonio Skarmeta]]'s 1985 novel ''Ardiente Paciencia'' (''Ardent Patience'', later known as ''El cartero de Neruda'', or ''Neruda's Postman''), which inspired the popular film ''[[Il Postino]]'' (1994).<ref name=\"Feinstein278\">Feinstein (2005) p. 278</ref>\n\n===Second return to Chile===\n\n[[File:Pablo Neruda (1966).jpg|thumb|right|Neruda recording his poetry at the U.S. Library of Congress in 1966]]\nBy 1952, the Gonz\u00e1lez Videla government was on its last legs, weakened by corruption scandals. The Chilean Socialist Party was in the process of nominating [[Salvador Allende]] as its candidate for the September 1952 presidential elections and was keen to have the presence of Neruda, by now Chile's most prominent left-wing literary figure, to support the campaign.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> Neruda returned to Chile in August of that year and rejoined Delia del Carril, who had traveled ahead of him some months earlier, but the marriage was crumbling. Del Carril eventually learned of his affair with Matilde Urrutia and he sent her back to Chile in 1955. She convinced the Chilean officials to lift his arrest, allowing Urrutia and Neruda to go to Capri, Italy. Now united with Urrutia, Neruda would, aside from many foreign trips and a stint as Allende's ambassador to France from 1970 to 1973, spend the rest of his life in Chile.\n\nBy this time, Neruda enjoyed worldwide fame as a poet, and his books were being translated into virtually all the major languages of the world.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> He vigorously denounced the United States during the [[Cuban missile crisis]] and later in the decade he likewise repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. But being one of the most prestigious and outspoken left-wing intellectuals alive, he also attracted opposition from ideological opponents. The [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], an anti-communist organization covertly established and funded by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]], adopted Neruda as one of its primary targets and launched a campaign to undermine his reputation, reviving the old claim that he had been an accomplice in the attack on Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940.<ref name=\"Feinstein487\">Feinstein (2005) p. 487</ref> The campaign became more intense when it became known that Neruda was a candidate for the 1964 Nobel Prize, which was eventually awarded to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]<ref name=\"Feinstein334\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 334\u20135</ref> (who rejected it).\n\n[[File:La Sebastiana Neruda 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|La Sebastiana, Neruda's house in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\nIn 1966, Neruda was invited to attend an [[International PEN]] conference in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 341\u20135</ref> Officially, he was barred from entering the U.S. because he was a communist, but the conference organizer, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], eventually prevailed upon the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] Administration to grant Neruda a visa.<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> Neruda gave readings to packed halls, and even recorded some poems for the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> Miller later opined that Neruda's adherence to his communist ideals of the 1930s was a result of his protracted exclusion from \"bourgeois society\". Due to the presence of many [[Eastern Bloc]] writers, Mexican writer [[Carlos Fuentes]] later wrote that the PEN conference marked a \"beginning of the end\" of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/>\n\nUpon Neruda's return to Chile, he stopped in Peru, where he gave readings to enthusiastic crowds in [[Lima]] and [[Arequipa]] and was received by President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> However, this visit also prompted an unpleasant backlash; because the Peruvian government had come out against the government of [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], July 1966 saw more than one hundred Cuban intellectuals retaliate against the poet by signing a letter that charged Neruda with colluding with the enemy, calling him an example of the \"tepid, pro-Yankee revisionism\" then prevalent in Latin America. The affair was particularly painful for Neruda because of his previous outspoken support for the Cuban revolution, and he never visited the island again, even after receiving an invitation in 1968.\n\nAfter the death of [[Che Guevara]] in [[Bolivia]] in 1967, Neruda wrote several articles regretting the loss of a \"great hero\".<ref name=\"Feinstein326\">Feinstein (2005) p. 326</ref> At the same time, he told his friend Aida Figueroa not to cry for Che, but for [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], the father of the Chilean communist movement, who preached a pacifist revolution over Che's violent ways.\n\n==Last years and death==\n[[File:La Chascona Santiago de Chile.jpg|thumb|La Chascona, Neruda's house in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]]]\nIn 1970, Neruda was nominated as a candidate for the Chilean presidency, but ended up giving his support to [[Salvador Allende]], who later won the [[1970 Chilean presidential election|election]] and was inaugurated in 1970 as the first democratically elected socialist head of state.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/><ref name=\"Feinstein367\">Feinstein (2005) p. 367</ref> Shortly thereafter, Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France, lasting from 1970\u20131972; his final diplomatic posting. During his stint in Paris, Neruda helped to renegotiate the external debt of Chile, billions owed to European and American banks, but within months of his arrival in Paris his health began to deteriorate.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> Neruda returned to Chile two and a half years later due to his failing health.\n[[File:Neruda Argentina.jpg|thumb|left| Buenos Aires 1971]]\n\nIn 1971, Neruda was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]],<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> a decision that did not come easily because some of the committee members had not forgotten Neruda's past praise of Stalinist dictatorship.

Both works were critically acclaimed and have been translated into many languages. Over the decades, ''Veinte poemas'' sold millions of copies and became Neruda's best-known work, though a second edition did not appear until 1932.

His experiences during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath moved him away from privately focused work in the direction of collective obligation. Neruda became an ardent [[Communism|Communist]] for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends, as well as that of del Carril, were contributing factors, but the most important catalyst was the execution of Garc\u00eda Lorca by forces loyal to the dictator [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''Espa\u00f1a en el coraz\u00f3n'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'', 1938). He lost his post as consul due to his political militancy.<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/>\n\nNeruda's marriage to Vogelzang broke down and Neruda eventually obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1943. His wife moved to [[Monte Carlo]] to escape the hostilities in Spain and then to the Netherlands with their only child, and he never saw either of them again.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 434</ref> After leaving his wife, Neruda lived with Delia del Carril in France, eventually marrying her (shortly after his divorce) in [[Tetecala]] in 1943.<ref>{{Mark Eisner : Pablo Neruda - The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 306</ref>\n\nFollowing the election of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], whom Neruda supported, as President of Chile in 1938, Neruda was appointed special consul for Spanish emigrants in Paris. There he was responsible for what he called \"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\": transporting 2,000 Spanish refugees who had been housed by the French in [[Concentration camps in France|squalid camps]] to Chile on an old ship called the ''[[Winnipeg (ship)|Winnipeg]]''.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 141</ref> Neruda is sometimes charged with having selected only fellow Communists for emigration, to the exclusion of others who had fought on the side of the Republic.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 145</ref> Many of these Republicans and Anarchists were killed during the German invasion and occupation. Others deny these accusations, pointing out that Neruda chose only a few hundred of the 2,000 refugees personally; the rest were selected by the Service for the Evacuation of Spanish Refugees set up by [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], President of the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish Republican Government in Exile]].\n\n===Mexican appointment===\n\nNeruda's next diplomatic post was as Consul General in [[Mexico City]] from 1940 to 1943.<ref name=\"Tarn17\">Tarn (1975) p. 17</ref> While he was there, he married del Carril, and learned that his daughter Malva had died, aged eight, in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/>\n\nIn 1940, after the failure of an assassination attempt against [[Leon Trotsky]], Neruda arranged a Chilean visa for the Mexican painter [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], who was accused of having been one of the conspirators in the assassination.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 340</ref> Neruda later said that he did it at the request of the Mexican President, [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]]. This enabled Siqueiros, then jailed, to leave Mexico for Chile, where he stayed in Neruda's private residence. In exchange for Neruda's assistance, Siqueiros spent over a year painting a mural in a school in [[Chill\u00e1n]]. Neruda's relationship with Siqueiros attracted criticism, but Neruda dismissed the allegation that his intent had been to help an assassin as \"sensationalist politico-literary harassment\".\n\n===Return to Chile===\n\nIn 1943, after his return to Chile, Neruda made a tour of [[Peru]], where he visited [[Machu Picchu]],<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 244</ref> an experience that later inspired [[The Heights of Macchu Picchu|''Alturas de Macchu Picchu'']], a book-length poem in twelve parts that he completed in 1945 and which expressed his growing awareness of, and interest in, the ancient civilizations of the Americas. He explored this theme further in ''[[Canto General]]'' (1950). In ''Alturas'', Neruda celebrated the achievement of Machu Picchu, but also condemned the slavery that had made it possible. In ''Canto XII'', he called upon the dead of many centuries to be born again and to speak through him. [[Mart\u00edn Espada]], poet and professor of creative writing at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has hailed the work as a masterpiece, declaring that \"there is no greater political poem\".\n\n===Communism===\n\nBolstered by his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, Neruda, like many left-leaning intellectuals of his generation, came to admire the [[Soviet Union]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], partly for the role it played in defeating [[Nazi Germany]] and partly because of an idealist interpretation of [[Marxist]] doctrine.<ref name=\"Feinstein\"/> This is echoed in poems such as \"Canto a Stalingrado\" (1942) and \"Nuevo canto de amor a Stalingrado\" (1943). In 1953, Neruda was awarded the [[Stalin Peace Prize]]. Upon Stalin's death that same year, Neruda wrote an ode to him, as he also wrote poems in praise of [[Fulgencio Batista]], \"Saludo a Batista\" (\"Salute to Batista\"), and later to [[Fidel Castro]]. His fervent Stalinism eventually drove a wedge between Neruda and his long-time friend [[Octavio Paz]], who commented that \"Neruda became more and more Stalinist, while I became less and less enchanted with Stalin.\"<ref>Roman, Joe. (1993)  ''Octavio Paz'' Chelsea House Publishers  {{ISBN|0-7910-1249-2}}</ref> Their differences came to a head after the Nazi-Soviet [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] of 1939, when they almost came to blows in an argument over Stalin. Although Paz still considered Neruda \"The greatest poet of his generation\", in an essay on [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] he wrote that when he thinks of \"Neruda and other famous Stalinist writers and poets, I feel the gooseflesh that I get from reading certain passages of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. No doubt they began in good faith [...] but insensibly, commitment by commitment, they saw themselves becoming entangled in a mesh of lies, falsehoods, deceits and perjuries, until they lost their souls.\"<ref>Paz, Octavio  (1991)  ''On Poets and Others''.

Anxious not to give ammunition to his ideological enemies, he would later refuse publicly to condemn the Soviet repression of dissident writers like [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Joseph Brodsky]], an attitude with which even some of his staunchest admirers disagreed.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 263</ref>\n\n{{Wikisource|I accuse (Neruda)|I Accuse}}\nOn 4 March 1945, Neruda was elected a Communist [[Senate of Chile|Senator]] for the northern provinces of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]] and [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] in the [[Atacama Desert]].<ref>Shull (2009) p. 69</ref><ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 181</ref> He officially joined the [[Communist Party of Chile]] four months later.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> In 1946, the Radical Party's presidential candidate, [[Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla]], asked Neruda to act as his campaign manager. Gonz\u00e1lez Videla was supported by a coalition of left-wing parties and Neruda fervently campaigned on his behalf. Once in office, however, Gonz\u00e1lez Videla turned against the Communist Party and issued the ''[[Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy|Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia]]'' (Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy). The breaking point for Senator Neruda was the violent repression of a Communist-led miners' strike in [[Lota, Chile|Lota]] in October 1947, when striking workers were herded into island military prisons and a [[Pisagua Prison Camp|concentration camp in the town of Pisagua]]. Neruda's criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez Videla culminated in a dramatic speech in the Chilean senate on 6 January 1948, which became known as \"Yo acuso\" (\"I accuse\"), in the course of which he read out the names of the miners and their families who were imprisoned at the concentration camp.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 199</ref>\n\nIn 1959 Neruda was present as [[Fidel Castro]] was honored at a welcoming ceremony offered by the [[Central University of Venezuela]] where he spoke to a massive gathering of students and read his [[Canto a Bolivar]]. Luis B\u00e1ez summarized what Neruda said: ''\"In this painful and victorious hour that the peoples of America live, my poem with changes of place, can be understood directed to Fidel Castro, because in the struggles for freedom the fate of a Man to give confidence to the spirit of greatness in the history of our peoples\".''\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was asked for his opinion of Pablo Neruda. Borges stated, \"I think of him as a very fine poet, a very fine poet. I don't admire him as a man, I think of him as a very mean man.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 95.</ref> He said that Neruda had not spoken out against Argentine President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] because he was afraid to risk his reputation, noting \"I was an Argentine poet, he was a Chilean poet, he's on the side of the Communists; I'm against them. So I felt he was behaving very wisely in avoiding a meeting that would have been quite uncomfortable for both of us.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Exile==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-10640-0020, Berlin, III.

Neruda later moved to [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], in southern Chile. From Valdivia he moved to ''Fundo Huishue'', a forestry estate in the vicinity of [[Huishue Lake]]. Neruda's life underground ended in March 1949 when he fled over the [[Lilpela Pass]] in the [[Andes Mountains]] to [[Argentina]] on horseback. He would dramatically recount his escape from Chile in his Nobel Prize lecture.\n\nOnce out of Chile, he spent the next three years in exile.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> In [[Buenos Aires]], Neruda took advantage of the slight resemblance between him and his friend, the future Nobel Prize-winning novelist and cultural attach\u00e9 to the [[Guatemala]]n embassy [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]], to travel to Europe using Asturias' passport.<ref name=\"Feinstein236\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 236\u20137</ref> [[Pablo Picasso]] arranged his entrance into [[Paris]] and Neruda made a surprise appearance there to a stunned World Congress of Peace Forces{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, while the Chilean government denied that the poet could have escaped the country.<ref name=\"Feinstein236\"/> Neruda spent those three years traveling extensively throughout Europe as well as taking trips to [[India]], [[China]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the Soviet Union.

Many of them dealt with his time underground in Chile, which is when he composed much of the poem. In fact, he had carried the manuscript with him during his escape on horseback.

Del Carril eventually learned of his affair with Matilde Urrutia and he sent her back to Chile in 1955. She convinced the Chilean officials to lift his arrest, allowing Urrutia and Neruda to go to Capri, Italy. Now united with Urrutia, Neruda would, aside from many foreign trips and a stint as Allende's ambassador to France from 1970 to 1973, spend the rest of his life in Chile.\n\nBy this time, Neruda enjoyed worldwide fame as a poet, and his books were being translated into virtually all the major languages of the world.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> He vigorously denounced the United States during the [[Cuban missile crisis]] and later in the decade he likewise repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. But being one of the most prestigious and outspoken left-wing intellectuals alive, he also attracted opposition from ideological opponents. The [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], an anti-communist organization covertly established and funded by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]], adopted Neruda as one of its primary targets and launched a campaign to undermine his reputation, reviving the old claim that he had been an accomplice in the attack on Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940.<ref name=\"Feinstein487\">Feinstein (2005) p. 487</ref> The campaign became more intense when it became known that Neruda was a candidate for the 1964 Nobel Prize, which was eventually awarded to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]<ref name=\"Feinstein334\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 334\u20135</ref> (who rejected it).\n\n[[File:La Sebastiana Neruda 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|La Sebastiana, Neruda's house in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\nIn 1966, Neruda was invited to attend an [[International PEN]] conference in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 341\u20135</ref> Officially, he was barred from entering the U.S. because he was a communist, but the conference organizer, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], eventually prevailed upon the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] Administration to grant Neruda a visa.<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> Neruda gave readings to packed halls, and even recorded some poems for the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> Miller later opined that Neruda's adherence to his communist ideals of the 1930s was a result of his protracted exclusion from \"bourgeois society\". Due to the presence of many [[Eastern Bloc]] writers, Mexican writer [[Carlos Fuentes]] later wrote that the PEN conference marked a \"beginning of the end\" of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/>\n\nUpon Neruda's return to Chile, he stopped in Peru, where he gave readings to enthusiastic crowds in [[Lima]] and [[Arequipa]] and was received by President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> However, this visit also prompted an unpleasant backlash; because the Peruvian government had come out against the government of [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], July 1966 saw more than one hundred Cuban intellectuals retaliate against the poet by signing a letter that charged Neruda with colluding with the enemy, calling him an example of the \"tepid, pro-Yankee revisionism\" then prevalent in Latin America. The affair was particularly painful for Neruda because of his previous outspoken support for the Cuban revolution, and he never visited the island again, even after receiving an invitation in 1968.\n\nAfter the death of [[Che Guevara]] in [[Bolivia]] in 1967, Neruda wrote several articles regretting the loss of a \"great hero\".<ref name=\"Feinstein326\">Feinstein (2005) p. 326</ref> At the same time, he told his friend Aida Figueroa not to cry for Che, but for [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], the father of the Chilean communist movement, who preached a pacifist revolution over Che's violent ways.\n\n==Last years and death==\n[[File:La Chascona Santiago de Chile.jpg|thumb|La Chascona, Neruda's house in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]]]\nIn 1970, Neruda was nominated as a candidate for the Chilean presidency, but ended up giving his support to [[Salvador Allende]], who later won the [[1970 Chilean presidential election|election]] and was inaugurated in 1970 as the first democratically elected socialist head of state.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/><ref name=\"Feinstein367\">Feinstein (2005) p. 367</ref> Shortly thereafter, Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France, lasting from 1970\u20131972; his final diplomatic posting. During his stint in Paris, Neruda helped to renegotiate the external debt of Chile, billions owed to European and American banks, but within months of his arrival in Paris his health began to deteriorate.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> Neruda returned to Chile two and a half years later due to his failing health.\n[[File:Neruda Argentina.jpg|thumb|left| Buenos Aires 1971]]\n\nIn 1971, Neruda was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]],<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> a decision that did not come easily because some of the committee members had not forgotten Neruda's past praise of Stalinist dictatorship.

Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0438|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043d\u0430|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Tones (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness {{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}}. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\n\n==Notation==\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znam\u00ebna'' (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or ''Kryuki'' (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. [[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|200px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]]\n\nThe stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.\n\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0447\u0438\u043a ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nAfter the fall of Kievan Rus' to the [[Mongols]], the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in [[Novgorod]]), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n\nGradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600,<ref>Velimirovic, Milos. \"The Present status of Research in Slavic Chant\". ''Acta Musicologica''. Vol. 44, Fasc. 2 (Jul. \u2013 Dec., 1972), pp. 251</ref> called \"red marks\" (Russian: \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 (''kinovarnye znaki'')), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system.\n\nThe use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the [[raskol|church reforms]] by [[Patriarch Nikon]].

Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0438|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043d\u0430|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Tones (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness {{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}}. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\n\n==Notation==\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znam\u00ebna'' (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or ''Kryuki'' (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. [[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|200px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]]\n\nThe stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.\n\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0447\u0438\u043a ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nAfter the fall of Kievan Rus' to the [[Mongols]], the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in [[Novgorod]]), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].\n\nGradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600,<ref>Velimirovic, Milos. \"The Present status of Research in Slavic Chant\". ''Acta Musicologica''. Vol. 44, Fasc. 2 (Jul. - Dec., 1972), pp. 251</ref> called \"red marks\" (Russian: \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 (''kinovarnye znaki'')), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system.\n\nThe use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the [[raskol|church reforms]] by [[Patriarch Nikon]]. From that time Western music started to penetrate into Russian culture, and the Russian-Orthodox Church introduced a \"Latin\", polyphonic way of singing, based on Polish, German and Italian harmonies. The term \"Latin\" however was considered derogatory, since it also referred to \"heretical Latin faith\".  Znamenny Chant, however, has been preserved to a certain degree in the chanting traditions that are directly descended from it.\n\n[[File:\u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d. \u0421\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0415\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441 1. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c. \u0412..ogg|thumb|left|Fyodor Krestianin (i.e. Christian).

It was released in April 1997 as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]''. The female part of song's chorus is sung by [[Bobo (singer)|Christiane \"Bobo\" Hebold]] of the German [[pop music|pop]] band ''[[Bobo in White Wooden Houses]]''. An English version of \"Engel\" can be found on US special editions of ''Sehnsucht''.\n\n==Music video==\nWhile [[Till Lindemann|Lindemann]], [[Christoph Schneider|Schneider]] and [[Christian Lorenz|Flake]] are in the audience, [[Paul Landers]] can be seen taking Schneider's place by playing the drums and [[Richard Z. Kruspe|Kruspe]] and [[Oliver Riedel|Riedel]] are seen singing. The video references to the 1996 film, [[From Dusk till Dawn]].\n\n==Live performances==\nA regular during the ''Sehnsucht'' tour, it was used as the last song of the main set in non-festival concerts. In the first months of the ''[[Mutter (Rammstein album)|Mutter]]'' (2001) tour, \"Engel\" appeared in the setlists sporadically, but became a regular again in November, and continued as the last song of the main set until the end of the tour.\n\nWhen performed on stage, flames shoot into the air, and Schneider's drumsticks would shoot sparks. On the 'Live aus Berlin' shows, Bobolina joins Rammstein to sing her parts from inside a flaming cage, instead of the usual pre-recorded chorus used in most of the shows. After missing the entire ''Reise, Reise'' tour; \"Engel\" returned to the setlists as the closing song of the Liebe Ist F\u00fcr Alle Da tour, taking place during 2009 and 2011. This time around, vocalist Till Lindemann sang the chorus instead of Bobo's pre-recorded lines. For the pyrotechnics, Lindemann wears a set of angel wings that shoot flames from the tips and that have sparks go off along them.<ref>{{cite web |author1=nasbootlegs |title=RAMMSTEIN - Engel + Final live London 2010 Wembley Arena |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9YkX7pBRm8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Engel was the penultimate song on the setlist during the [[Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour]], and the [[Rammstein Tour 2016|tour]] in 2016\n[[File:Till-ENGEL2.jpg|thumb|Engel in the LIFAD Tour]]\n[[File:Rammstein in Minsk, 2010.jpg|thumb|Rammstein playing \"Engel\" in [[Minsk]], Belarus]]\n\n==In other media==\nThe song was used during the end credits of the 1997 film, [[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]], and also appears on its soundtrack.\n\n==Track listings==\n===Single===\n# Engel - 4:23\n# Sehnsucht - 4:02\n# Rammstein ([[Eskimos and Egypt|Eskimos & Egypt]] [[Radio edit|Radio Edit]]) - 3:40\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt [[Instrumental]] Edit) - 3:32\n# Rammstein (Original) - 4:25\n\n===Fan Edition===\nA second single called ''Engel (Fan Edition)'' was released on 23 May 1997.

It was released in April 1997 as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]''. The female part of song's chorus is sung by [[Bobo (singer)|Christiane \"Bobo\" Hebold]] of the German [[pop music|pop]] band ''[[Bobo in White Wooden Houses]]''. An English version of \"Engel\" can be found on US special editions of ''Sehnsucht''.\n\n==Music video==\nWhile [[Till Lindemann|Lindemann]], [[Christoph Schneider|Schneider]] and [[Christian Lorenz|Flake]] are in the audience, [[Paul Landers]] can be seen taking Schneider's place by playing the drums and [[Richard Z. Kruspe|Kruspe]] and [[Oliver Riedel|Riedel]] are seen singing. The video references to the 1996 film, [[From Dusk till Dawn]].\n\n==Live performances==\nA regular during the ''Sehnsucht'' tour, it was used as the last song of the main set in non-festival concerts. In the first months of the ''[[Mutter (Rammstein album)|Mutter]]'' (2001) tour, \"Engel\" appeared in the setlists sporadically, but became a regular again in November, and continued as the last song of the main set until the end of the tour.\n\nWhen performed on stage, flames shoot into the air, and Schneider's drumsticks would shoot sparks. On the 'Live aus Berlin' shows, Bobolina joins Rammstein to sing her parts from inside a flaming cage, instead of the usual pre-recorded chorus used in most of the shows. After missing the entire ''Reise, Reise'' tour; \"Engel\" returned to the setlists as the closing song of the Liebe Ist F\u00fcr Alle Da tour, taking place during 2009 and 2011. This time around, vocalist Till Lindemann sang the chorus instead of Bobo's pre-recorded lines. For the pyrotechnics, Lindemann wears a set of angel wings that shoot flames from the tips and that have sparks go off along them.<ref>{{cite web |author1=nasbootlegs |title=RAMMSTEIN - Engel + Final live London 2010 Wembley Arena |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9YkX7pBRm8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Engel was the penultimate song on the setlist during the [[Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour]], and the [[Rammstein Tour 2016|tour]] in 2016\n[[File:Till-ENGEL2.jpg|thumb|Engel in the LIFAD Tour]]\n[[File:Rammstein in Minsk, 2010.jpg|thumb|Rammstein playing \"Engel\" in [[Minsk]], Belarus]]\n\n==In other media==\nThe song was used during the end credits of the 1997 film, [[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]] and also appears on its soundtrack.\n\n==Track listings==\n===Single===\n# Engel - 4:23\n# Sehnsucht - 4:02\n# Rammstein ([[Eskimos and Egypt|Eskimos & Egypt]] [[Radio edit|Radio Edit]]) - 3:40\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt [[Instrumental]] Edit) - 3:32\n# Rammstein (Original) - 4:25\n\n===Fan Edition===\nA second single called ''Engel (Fan Edition)'' was released on 23 May 1997.
