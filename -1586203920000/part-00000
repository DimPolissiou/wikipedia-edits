Prior to the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]], Girdap was among the six largest banks in Bulgaria, and during the wars its financial group was the most influential in the country.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nGirdap's constituent assembly was held on 1 December 1881, less than four years after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and the establishment of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]]. At the time, the northeastern Bulgarian city of Ruse was a major economic hub. Ruse prospered due to its role as a major port on the [[Danube]], its rapid industrial development and its well-established ties with [[Central Europe]] along that river. Banking, however, was a new concept, as most people employed the services of money lenders and entrusted their savings to people they knew personally. The founders of Girdap sought to \"liberate the population of money lenders\", in the words of later bank director Boncho Boev.<ref name=\"papazova265\">\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, p. 265.</ref> Due to an overall lack of capital in the country, interest rates of loans given by Girdap were nonetheless high: 15\u201318% as compared to the over 20\u201330% interest rate of money lenders. The bank officially commenced operations on 1 January 1882. It took its name from the Girdap neighbourhood of Ruse where the constituent assembly was held.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0438, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe capital of Girdap at the time of its foundation amounted to 1,380 [[Bulgarian lev|Bulgarian gold leva]], though by the end of 1882 it had increased fivefold to 6,900 gold leva.<ref name=\"papazova265\"/> In 1886, the capital of Girdap amounted to 70,300 leva; in that year, the bank hired a clerk for the first time. In the year of the company's 10th anniversary, 1891, it disposed of 300,000 leva, and in 1894 its capital had increased to 1,000,000 leva. Founded as a depositor's company, it was transformed into a [[joint stock company|joint-stock credit company]] in 1894.<ref name=\"sivri83\">\u0421\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0438, p. 83.</ref> In 1898, Girdap's capital was 1,500,000 leva and a new company statute was approved, which extended the board of managers to 12 members. These included Ruse's wealthiest and most eminent people, most notably the chairman Stefan Simeonov.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0438, pp. 83\u201384.</ref> In the autumn of 1902, Girdap opened its first branch offices outside Ruse: in the port of [[Varna]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Dobruja]]n city of [[Dobrich]] and in [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]), the capital of the Ottoman Empire and largest city of the [[Balkans]]. In Istanbul, the bank was known under a [[French language|French]] name, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Cr\u00e9dit Ghirdap'', though the branch only existed for 18 months and was closed down due to political pressure. An office in [[Silistra]] was opened on 1 August 1910.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0438, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nEver since its establishment Girdap served political interests, and it was later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of [[Stefan Stambolov]]. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Commercial Bank (''Balgarska targovska banka''), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, was close to the Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition.<ref>\u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432, pp. 503-505.</ref> These relations were often damaging to the Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, p. 266.</ref> As the [[Economy of Bulgaria|Bulgarian economy]] consolidated in the first decade of the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] after the Bulgarian Commercial Bank and the [[Deutsche Bank]]-related Credit Bank (''Kreditna banka''). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.<ref>\u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432, p. 506.</ref>\n\n=== Heyday and bankruptcy ===\nGirdap's heyday was during the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]] (1912\u20131918), when it became the leading financial group in the kingdom and remained close to the government. It controlled some 83.97 million leva of invested capital, which put it ahead of the General Credit Society, the Balkan Bank and the Bulgarian Commercial Bank financial group. During the wars, Bulgarian banks established filial companies or invested in new enterprises. Girdap was no exception to that trend.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, p. 267.</ref>\n\nOne of Girdap's notable enterprises was the international transport company Transbalkania which had a capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after [[World War I]], Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to [[Edirne]], [[Alexandroupoli]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Ni\u0161]] and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in [[tobacco]] trade and had warehouses in modern [[Dupnitsa]], [[Blagoevgrad]] and [[Xanthi]]. This led to the establishment of another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (''Balgarska makedonska banka''), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a commercial bank, which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (''Sofiyska banka'', established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest Commercial Bank (''Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka'', established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (''Balgarska garantsionna banka'', established in 1912). The [[Pleven]]-based Lev [[cement]] factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board of managers member Ivan Kovachev as chief shareholder. Ninety percent of the capital of the [[Novi Iskar|Kurilo]] mine in the [[Iskar Gorge]] was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, pp. 267\u2013268.</ref> Despite Girdap's active involvement in assistance to national industry, it failed to make a significant contribution and gradually minimised its participation due to insufficient profits.<ref>Lampe, p. 255.</ref>\n\nAfter World War I, Girdap was deprived of its government protections, as it had no links to the new agrarian government of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]]. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in [[Berkovitsa]] for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the [[Bulgarian National Bank]] closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While at the time the Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of [[bankruptcy]], it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.<ref>\u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432, pp. 509\u2013510, 513\u2013515.</ref>\n\n== Headquarters in Ruse ==\n[[File:Girdap Bank Ruse Bulgaria pre-1913.jpg|right|thumb|The Girdap headquarters before the attic burned down in 1913 and an additional floor was constructed]]\nGirdap's central office in Ruse was located in a historic edifice at 2 Aleksandrovska Street that takes up {{convert|260|m2|sqft}}. It was finished in 1896 and designed either by Stoyan Zolotov and Udo Ribau (architect of what is known as [[Old High School of Music, Rousse|Ruse's Old High School of Music]]) or by Samuil Danailov, at the time still an architecture student. Together with the opposing building owned by [[wine]] merchant Petar Petrov and built in 1897 under [[Vienna|Viennese]] architect Georg Lang, the Girdap headquarters are part of an architectural ensemble highlighting the entrance to Ruse's commercial street from Liberty Square, the location of the [[Monument of Liberty, Rousse|Monument of Liberty]].<ref name=\"sivri83\"/>\n\nThe building's attic was damaged in a fire in 1913.<ref name=\"sivri83\"/> An additional storey was constructed in 1935 under the engineer Todor Tonev, turning the headquarters into a three-storey edifice. The trademark clock was added in the late 19th century. In 1964\u20131967, the building's interior was refurbished so it could accommodate the City People's Council. Today, it houses the administration of Ruse's Chamber of Control.<ref name=\"municipality\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://libruse.bg/Kakvo_novo/Ruse_virt/Dohodno_zdanie/Banka_Girdap/banka_girdap.html|title=\u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0413\u0438\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043f|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u201e\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u201d, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0435|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=3 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710153111/http://libruse.bg/Kakvo_novo/Ruse_virt/Dohodno_zdanie/Banka_Girdap/banka_girdap.html|archivedate=10 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | last = \u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432 | first = \u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d | year = 2007 | title = \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043c |volume=\u0422.

These included Ruse's wealthiest and most eminent people, most notably the chairman Stefan Simeonov.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0438, pp. 83\u201384.</ref> In the autumn of 1902, Girdap opened its first branch offices outside Ruse: in the port of [[Varna]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Dobruja]]n city of [[Dobrich]] and in [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]), the capital of the Ottoman Empire and largest city of the [[Balkans]]. In Istanbul, the bank was known under a [[French language|French]] name, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Cr\u00e9dit Ghirdap'', though the branch only existed for 18 months and was closed down due to political pressure. An office in [[Silistra]] was opened on 1 August 1910.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0438, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nEver since its establishment Girdap served political interests, and it was later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of [[Stefan Stambolov]]. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Commercial Bank (''Balgarska targovska banka''), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, was close to the Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition.<ref>\u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432, pp. 503-505.</ref> These relations were often damaging to the Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, p. 266.</ref> As the [[Economy of Bulgaria|Bulgarian economy]] consolidated in the first decade of the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] after the Bulgarian Commercial Bank and the [[Deutsche Bank]]-related Credit Bank (''Kreditna banka''). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.<ref>\u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432, p. 506.</ref>\n\n=== Heyday and bankruptcy ===\nGirdap's heyday was during the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]] (1912\u20131918), when it became the leading financial group in the kingdom and remained close to the government. It controlled some 83.97 million leva of invested capital, which put it ahead of the General Credit Society, the Balkan Bank and the Bulgarian Commercial Bank financial group. During the wars, Bulgarian banks established filial companies or invested in new enterprises. Girdap was no exception to that trend.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, p. 267.</ref>\n\nOne of Girdap's notable enterprises was the international transport company Transbalkania which had a capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after [[World War I]], Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to [[Edirne]], [[Alexandroupoli]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Ni\u0161]] and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in [[tobacco]] trade and had warehouses in modern [[Dupnitsa]], [[Blagoevgrad]] and [[Xanthi]]. This led to the establishment of another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (''Balgarska makedonska banka''), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a commercial bank, which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (''Sofiyska banka'', established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest Commercial Bank (''Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka'', established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (''Balgarska garantsionna banka'', established in 1912). The [[Pleven]]-based Lev [[cement]] factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board of managers member Ivan Kovachev as chief shareholder. Ninety percent of the capital of the [[Novi Iskar|Kurilo]] mine in the [[Iskar Gorge]] was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430, pp. 267\u2013268.</ref> Despite Girdap's active involvement in assistance to national industry, it failed to make a significant contribution and gradually minimized its participation due to insufficient profits.<ref>Lampe, p. 255.</ref>\n\nAfter World War I, Girdap was deprived of its government protections, as it had no links to the new agrarian government of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]]. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in [[Berkovitsa]] for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the [[Bulgarian National Bank]] closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While at the time the Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of [[bankruptcy]], it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.<ref>\u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432, pp. 509\u2013510, 513\u2013515.</ref>\n\n== Headquarters in Ruse ==\n[[File:Girdap Bank Ruse Bulgaria pre-1913.jpg|right|thumb|The Girdap headquarters before the attic burned down in 1913 and an additional floor was constructed]]\nGirdap's central office in Ruse was located in a historic edifice at 2 Aleksandrovska Street that takes up {{convert|260|m2|sqft}}. It was finished in 1896 and designed either by Stoyan Zolotov and Udo Ribau (architect of what is known as [[Old High School of Music, Rousse|Ruse's Old High School of Music]]) or by Samuil Danailov, at the time still an architecture student. Together with the opposing building owned by [[wine]] merchant Petar Petrov and built in 1897 under [[Vienna|Viennese]] architect Georg Lang, the Girdap headquarters are part of an architectural ensemble highlighting the entrance to Ruse's commercial street from Liberty Square, the location of the [[Monument of Liberty, Rousse|Monument of Liberty]].<ref name=\"sivri83\"/>\n\nThe building's attic was damaged in a fire in 1913.<ref name=\"sivri83\"/> An additional storey was constructed in 1935 under the engineer Todor Tonev, turning the headquarters into a three-storey edifice. The trademark clock was added in the late 19th century. In 1964\u20131967, the building's interior was refurbished so it could accommodate the City People's Council. Today, it houses the administration of Ruse's Chamber of Control.<ref name=\"municipality\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://libruse.bg/Kakvo_novo/Ruse_virt/Dohodno_zdanie/Banka_Girdap/banka_girdap.html|title=\u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0413\u0438\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043f|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u201e\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u201d, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0435|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=3 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710153111/http://libruse.bg/Kakvo_novo/Ruse_virt/Dohodno_zdanie/Banka_Girdap/banka_girdap.html|archivedate=10 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | last = \u0410\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432 | first = \u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d | year = 2007 | title = \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043c |volume=\u0422.

There is a case for regarding the six motets catalogued [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 225\u2013230 as being authenticated, although there is some doubt about one of them, [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'']]. A seventh motet, [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]], which was formerly attributed to Bach's older cousin [[Johann Christoph Bach]], appears to be at least partly by Bach, and if so was probably composed during his Weimar period.\n\n[[BWV 228]] is another motet which appears to have been written at [[Weimar]], between 1708 and 1717, the others were composed in [[Leipzig]]. \nSeveral of the motets were written for funerals. There is some uncertainty as to the extent that motets would have been called for in normal church services - there is evidence that it was considered an archaic form. The text of [[Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt, BWV Anh. 160|''Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt'', BWV Anh. 160]] (whether or not the piece is attributable to Bach) suggests a performance at Christmas. Another possible use is a pedagogical one, Bach's biographer [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]] suggested that the choral writing would have been useful for training Bach's young singers, and Christoph Wolff has argued that this could apply in particular to [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'']].<ref>Wolff, Christoph.

This motet uses [[Psalm 149]]:1\u20133 for its first movement, the third stanza of \"[[Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren]]\" (a 1530 [[hymn]] after [[Psalm 103]] by [[Johann Gramann]]) for the second movement, and [[Psalm 150]]:2 and 6 for its third movement.{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|p=228}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf]]}} (The Spirit gives aid to our weakness), BWV 226, a motet in B-flat major scored for two four-part choirs, was performed in Leipzig in 1729 for the funeral of [[Johann Heinrich Ernesti]].

It takes its title from the hymn \"[[Jesu, meine Freude]]\" by [[Johann Franck]] on which it is based. The stanzas of the chorale are interspersed with passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The chorale melody on which several movements are based was by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653).

The work in two movements draws its text from the [[Book of Isaiah]] and a hymn by [[Paul Gerhardt]]. Traditionally, scholars believed that Bach composed it in Leipzig in 1726, while more recent scholarship suggests for stylistic reasons that it was already composed during Bach's Weimar period. It has been compared to another motet for double choir [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]], which is possibly by Bach.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{cite web | url=http://www.monteverdi.org.uk/downloads/booklets/sdg716.pdf | title=Bach Motets | accessdate=9 September 2015 | author=Gardiner, John Eliot | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203735/http://www.monteverdi.org.uk/downloads/booklets/sdg716.pdf | archive-date=4 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* {{lang|de|[[Komm, Jesu, komm, BWV 229|Komm, Jesu, komm]]}} (Come, Jesus, come), BWV 229, is a motet in [[G minor]] composed in Leipzig, which received its first performance by 1731\u20131732.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden]]}} (Praise the Lord, all ye heathen), BWV 230, is a motet in [[C major]] scored for four voices, which draws its text from [[Psalm 117]]:[[s:Bible (King James)/Psalms#117:1|1\u20132]].

There is a case for regarding the six motets catalogued [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 225\u2013230 as being authenticated, although there is some doubt about one of them, [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'']]. A seventh motet, [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]], which was formerly attributed to Bach's older cousin [[Johann Christoph Bach]], appears to be at least partly by Bach, and if so was probably composed during his Weimar period.\n\n[[BWV 228]] is another motet which appears to have been written at [[Weimar]], between 1708 and 1717, the others were composed in [[Leipzig]]. \nSeveral of the motets were written for funerals. There is some uncertainty as to the extent that motets would have been called for in normal church services - there is evidence that it was considered an archaic form. The text of [[Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt, BWV Anh. 160|''Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt'', BWV Anh. 160]] (whether or not the piece is attributable to Bach) suggests a performance at Christmas. Another possible use is a pedagogical one, Bach's biographer [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]] suggested that the choral writing would have been useful for training Bach's young singers, and Christoph Wolff has argued that this could apply in particular to [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'']].<ref>Wolff, Christoph.

The work in two movements draws its text from the [[Book of Isaiah]] and a hymn by [[Paul Gerhardt]]. Traditionally, scholars believed that Bach composed it in Leipzig in 1726, while more recent scholarship suggests for stylistic reasons that it was already composed during Bach's Weimar period.

The Thomanerchor, for example, recorded the set in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> However, there were several pre-War recordings of the motets. The first recording of a Bach motet was a 1927 version of ''Jesu Meine Freude''.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nOne of the decisions which needs to be made is how many voices to use per part. The motets have been recorded with [[one voice per part]] by [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]]. Most recordings deploy more than one singer per part; for example, [[Masaaki Suzuki]] and his [[Bach Collegium Japan]] use a chorus of eighteen singers.<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach - Motets |website=Bis |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The motets have also been recorded by the British group [[The Sixteen]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |date=1998 |editor1-last=D\u00fcrr |editor1-first=Alfred |editor1-link=Alfred D\u00fcrr |editor2-last=Kobayashi |editor2-first=Yoshitake |title=Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe \u2013 Nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Theresa May]]'s premiership \u2013 a post from which [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned]] in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]] two years later. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the U.K. that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice,\" which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Theresa May]]'s premiership \u2013 a post from which [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned]] in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]] two years later. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the U.K. that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice,\" which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

He was killed in action when a Japanese [[kamikaze]] aircraft struck his flagship {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}} on January 6, 1945 in [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|Lingayen Gulf]], Philippine Islands. He died the next day January 7, 1945 from severely scorched lungs.\n\n==Early life and career==\nTheodore Edson Chandler was born at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], in 1894, on the day after Christmas, the son of Rear Admiral Lloyd Horwitz Chandler, USN, and Mrs. (Agatha Edson) Chandler. He was the grandson of [[William E. Chandler]] (1835\u20131917)  who served as [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] during the [[Chester A. Arthur]] administration and a [[U.S. Senator]] from [[New Hampshire]] and [[Lucy Lambert Hale]] (1841\u20131915).<ref>Bill O'Reilly, \"Killing Lincoln\" pp. 285-286, 2011</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Manlius Pebble Hill School|Manlius School for Boys]] and Swavely's Army and Navy Preparatory School before his appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]] for the Second District of New Hampshire in 1911. As a [[Midshipman#United States Navy from 1845|Midshipman]] he won letters in basketball and lacrosse. He graduated and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]] on 4 June 1915. The new officer received orders to report for duty in the [[battleship]] {{USS|Florida|BB-30|2}}. Chandler next served briefly on board the battleship {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}} before beginning training in the use of [[torpedo]]es at the end of April 1917, on board {{USS|Montana|ACR-13|2}}. On August 2, he completed that assignment and four days later joined the precommissioning complement of the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Conner|DD-72|2}}, then being fitted out at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]].\n\n==World War I and interwar years==\nIn May 1918, [[Lieutenant junior grade]] Chandler sailed in ''Conner'' to [[Brest, France]], his destroyer's base during the last six months of [[World War I]]. After the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]], his service in European waters included a brief term as the temporary commanding officer of ''Conner''.\n\nChandler returned home in April 1919.  On April 28, 1919, he married Beatrice Bowen Fairfax in Washington, D.C.<ref>https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/chandler-ii--ddg-996-.html</ref><ref>[Army and Navy Register, May 3, 1919, p. 561 https://books.google.com/books?id=b0s-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA561&lpg=PA561&dq=Beatrice+Bowen+Fairfax+Chandler&source=bl&ots=ppa7R-ZIln&sig=ACfU3U1ogq4X0I93kIx_WwR6X4UMgI0x9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwipqJLbip_lAhVSHqwKHcRkAREQ6AEwDHoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=Beatrice%20Bowen%20Fairfax%20Chandler&f=false]</ref>  In May, 1919, he reported to the shipyard of the [[William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Co.]] to help outfit the destroyer {{USS|Chandler|DD-206|2}}, named in honor of his late grandfather, former [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William E. Chandler]]. After her commissioning in September, he served in that ship until December 1920, when he was detached to return to the United States.\n\nOn January 2, 1921, he reported for duty at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] at Annapolis, Maryland, and began a 29-month series of ordnance-related studies. On December 26, 1922, Theodora Edson Chandler was born.  She was the only child born to Theodore and Beatrice Chandler.  On June 1, 1923, he completed training duty and, after a brief leave of absence, reported to [[Newport News, Virginia]], on July 4 for duty in conjunction with the outfitting of the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}. The battleship went into commission on 1 December, and Chandler served in her until 16 January 1925 when he transferred to the battleship {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|2}}.\n\nIn June 1926, newly promoted Lt. Comdr. Chandler came ashore once more for a two-year assignment at the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown|Naval Mine Depot, Yorktown]], Virginia. A nine-month tour of duty as gunnery officer in the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Trenton|CL-11|2}} followed. He reported on board the auxiliary vessel {{USS|General Alava|AG-5|2}} on April 24, 1929 but was detached only two days later to assume command of the destroyer {{USS|Pope|DD-225|2}}. In October 1930, he began another series of shore assignments, reporting initially to the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] and then to the [[Army Industrial College]] before rounding out duty ashore with a brief tour in the office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]].\n\nOn May 30, 1932, Chandler resumed sea duty as gunnery officer on the staff of the Commander Destroyers [[Battle Force]]. On February 2, 1934, he assumed command of the destroyer {{USS|Buchanan|DD-131|2}}. Between August 1935 and June 1938, he served three successive tours as assistant [[naval attach\u00e9]]: first at [[Paris]], then at [[Madrid]], and finally at [[Lisbon]].\n\nHe arrived in [[Camden, New Jersey]], in June 1938 to help fit out the light cruiser {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}; and he served as her [[executive officer]] until July 1940. Next, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] for a 15-month assignment in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Near the end of that tour of duty, he was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] on July 18, 1941.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Atlantic campaigns===\nChandler relieved Capt. P.&nbsp;P. Powell as commanding officer of the light cruiser {{USS|Omaha|CL-4|2}} on October 15. Shortly over three weeks later, an event occurred that highlighted Chandler's tour in command of the light cruiser.\n\nOn the morning of November 6, 1941, ''Omaha'', in company with the destroyer {{USS|Somers|DD-381|2}}, came across a darkened ship that acted suspiciously when challenged. That ship\u2014although bearing the name ''Willmoto'' and purportedly operating out of [[Philadelphia]]\u2014proved to be the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[blockade runner]] ''Odenwald'', bound for Germany with 3,857 metric tons of raw [[rubber]] in her holds. [[Scuttling|Scuttled]] by her crew, the German ship began to sink; but Capt. Chandler sent a party on the German vessel that controlled the flooding and salvaged the ship. This was the last occasion on which American sailors received [[prize money]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nFor most of the next 18 months, ''Omaha'' cruised the waters of the [[South Atlantic]] in search of German blockade runners and [[submarine]]s. That tour of duty ended in April 1943, when Chandler was selected to command United States naval forces in the [[Aruba]]-[[Cura\u00e7ao]] area. On May 3, 1944, he was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. In July 1944, Rear Admiral Chandler took command of Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv&nbsp;2), [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. In that capacity, he participated in [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern [[France]] in mid-August, and commanded the \"Sitka-Romeo\" force which captured the [[Iles d'Hyeres]] just off the coast of [[Provence]].\n\n===Pacific campaigns===\nShortly thereafter, Rear Admiral Chandler was given command of [[Battleship Division 2]] (BatDiv&nbsp;2) of the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].\n\nHe reported for duty on October 2 in time to command his ships &mdash; part of Rear Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]]'s bombardment group &mdash; during the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte invasion]] and helped to repulse the Japanese southern attack group\u2014[[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]s [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s Force \"C\" and [[Kiyohide Shima]]'s 2d Striking Force\u2014in the [[Surigao Strait]] phase of the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]].\n\nOn December 8, 1944, Rear Admiral Chandler was shifted to command of CruDiv&nbsp;4 and flew his flag above {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}}. During the voyage from [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] to [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]] for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]], Chandler's cruisers came under heavy Japanese air attacks\u2014mostly by [[kamikaze]]s.\n[[File:USS Louisville (CA-28) is hit by a kamikaze in Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945 (80-G-363217).jpg|thumb|right|250px|USS Louisville attacked 6 January 1945]]\nLate in the afternoon of January 5, 1945, a group of sixteen kamikazes swooped in on the force then about 100 miles (200&nbsp;km) from [[Manila Bay]]. One of the four successful kamikazes crashed into Rear Admiral Chandler's flagship {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}} at her number&nbsp;No. 2 main battery 8-inch 55 caliber gun putting it out of commission, but continued her bombarding mission and downed several planes. On January 6, 1945 the cruiser suffered more severely during a second attack. At 17:30, another kamikaze plunged into the cruiser's starboard side at the signal bridge where explosives wrought havoc. Rear Admiral Chandler jumped from the bridge to the signal bridge though horribly burned by gasoline flames, Chandler helped deploy fire hoses alongside enlisted men to stop the flames and then waited his turn for [[first aid]] with those same ratings. The admiral, his lungs scorched very severely, was beyond help. He died the next day January 7, 1945 in spite of the efforts of the medical department. Admiral Chandler is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Manila Philippines National Cemetery.\n\n==Namesakes==\nTwo ships in the U.S. Navy have been named after Chandler.  In October 1945, the destroyer {{USS|Theodore E. Chandler|DD-717|3}} was named in his honor.  In 1983, the {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer|0}} guided missile destroyer {{USS|Chandler|DDG-996|3}} was named after him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{DANFS}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t4/theodore_e_chandler-i.htm |accessdate=2007-03-04\n|title=Theodore E.

As a [[Midshipman#United States Navy from 1845|Midshipman]] he won letters in basketball and lacrosse. He graduated and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]] on 4 June 1915. The new officer received orders to report for duty in the [[battleship]] {{USS|Florida|BB-30|2}}. Chandler next served briefly on board the battleship {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}} before beginning training in the use of [[torpedo]]es at the end of April 1917, on board {{USS|Montana|ACR-13|2}}. On August 2, he completed that assignment and four days later joined the precommissioning complement of the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Conner|DD-72|2}}, then being fitted out at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]].\n\n==World War I and interwar years==\nIn May 1918, [[Lieutenant junior grade]] Chandler sailed in ''Conner'' to [[Brest, France]], his destroyer's base during the last six months of [[World War I]]. After the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]], his service in European waters included a brief term as the temporary commanding officer of ''Conner''.\n\nChandler returned home in April 1919.  On April 28, 1919, he married Beatrice Bowen Fairfax in Washington, D.C.<ref>https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/chandler-ii--ddg-996-.html</ref><ref>[Army and Navy Register, May 3, 1919, p. 561 https://books.google.com/books?id=b0s-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA561&lpg=PA561&dq=Beatrice+Bowen+Fairfax+Chandler&source=bl&ots=ppa7R-ZIln&sig=ACfU3U1ogq4X0I93kIx_WwR6X4UMgI0x9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwipqJLbip_lAhVSHqwKHcRkAREQ6AEwDHoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=Beatrice%20Bowen%20Fairfax%20Chandler&f=false]</ref>  In May, 1919, he reported to the shipyard of the [[William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Co.]] to help outfit the destroyer {{USS|Chandler|DD-206|2}}, named in honor of his late grandfather, former [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William E. Chandler]]. After her commissioning in September, he served in that ship until December 1920, when he was detached to return to the United States.\n\nOn January 2, 1921, he reported for duty at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] at Annapolis, Maryland, and began a 29-month series of ordnance-related studies. On December 26, 1922, Theodora Edson Chandler was born.  She was the only child born to Theodore and Beatrice Chandler.  On June 1, 1923, he completed training duty and, after a brief leave of absence, reported to [[Newport News, Virginia]], on July 4 for duty in conjunction with the outfitting of the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}. The battleship went into commission on 1 December, and Chandler served in her until 16 January 1925 when he transferred to the battleship {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|2}}.\n\nIn June 1926, newly promoted Lt. Comdr. Chandler came ashore once more for a two-year assignment at the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown|Naval Mine Depot, Yorktown]], Virginia. A nine-month tour of duty as gunnery officer in the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Trenton|CL-11|2}} followed. He reported on board the auxiliary vessel {{USS|General Alava|AG-5|2}} on April 24, 1929 but was detached only two days later to assume command of the destroyer {{USS|Pope|DD-225|2}}. In October 1930, he began another series of shore assignments, reporting initially to the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] and then to the [[Army Industrial College]] before rounding out duty ashore with a brief tour in the office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]].\n\nOn May 30, 1932, Chandler resumed sea duty as gunnery officer on the staff of the Commander Destroyers [[Battle Force]]. On February 2, 1934, he assumed command of the destroyer {{USS|Buchanan|DD-131|2}}. Between August 1935 and June 1938, he served three successive tours as assistant [[naval attach\u00e9]]: first at [[Paris]], then at [[Madrid]], and finally at [[Lisbon]].\n\nHe arrived in [[Camden, New Jersey]], in June 1938 to help fit out the light cruiser {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}; and he served as her [[executive officer]] until July 1940. Next, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] for a 15-month assignment in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Near the end of that tour of duty, he was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] on July 18, 1941.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Atlantic campaigns===\nChandler relieved Capt. P.&nbsp;P. Powell as commanding officer of the light cruiser {{USS|Omaha|CL-4|2}} on October 15. Shortly over three weeks later, an event occurred that highlighted Chandler's tour in command of the light cruiser.\n\nOn the morning of November 6, 1941, ''Omaha'', in company with the destroyer {{USS|Somers|DD-381|2}}, came across a darkened ship that acted suspiciously when challenged. That ship\u2014although bearing the name ''Willmoto'' and purportedly operating out of [[Philadelphia]]\u2014proved to be the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[blockade runner]] ''Odenwald'', bound for Germany with 3,857 metric tons of raw [[rubber]] in her holds. [[Scuttling|Scuttled]] by her crew, the German ship began to sink; but Capt. Chandler sent a party on the German vessel that controlled the flooding and salvaged the ship. This was the last occasion on which American sailors received [[prize money]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nFor most of the next 18 months, ''Omaha'' cruised the waters of the [[South Atlantic]] in search of German blockade runners and [[submarine]]s. That tour of duty ended in April 1943, when Chandler was selected to command United States naval forces in the [[Aruba]]-[[Cura\u00e7ao]] area. On May 3, 1944, he was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. In July 1944, Rear Admiral Chandler took command of Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv&nbsp;2), [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. In that capacity, he participated in [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern [[France]] in mid-August, and commanded the \"Sitka-Romeo\" force which captured the [[Iles d'Hyeres]] just off the coast of [[Provence]].\n\n===Pacific campaigns===\nShortly thereafter, Rear Admiral Chandler was given command of [[Battleship Division 2]] (BatDiv&nbsp;2) of the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].\n\nHe reported for duty on October 2 in time to command his ships &mdash; part of Rear Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]]'s bombardment group &mdash; during the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte invasion]] and helped to repulse the Japanese southern attack group\u2014[[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]s [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s Force \"C\" and [[Kiyohide Shima]]'s 2d Striking Force\u2014in the [[Surigao Strait]] phase of the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]].\n\nOn December 8, 1944, Rear Admiral Chandler was shifted to command of CruDiv&nbsp;4 and flew his flag above {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}}. During the voyage from [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] to [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]] for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]], Chandler's cruisers came under heavy Japanese air attacks\u2014mostly by [[kamikaze]]s.\n[[File:USS Louisville (CA-28) is hit by a kamikaze in Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945 (80-G-363217).jpg|thumb|right|250px|USS Louisville attacked 6 January 1945]]\nLate in the afternoon of January 5, 1945, a group of sixteen kamikazes swooped in on the force then about 100 miles (200&nbsp;km) from [[Manila Bay]]. One of the four successful kamikazes crashed into Rear Admiral Chandler's flagship {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}} at her number&nbsp;No. 2 main battery 8-inch 55 caliber gun putting it out of commission, but continued her bombarding mission and downed several planes. On January 6, 1945 the cruiser suffered more severely during a second attack. At 17:30, another kamikaze plunged into the cruiser's starboard side at the signal bridge where explosives wrought havoc. Rear Admiral Chandler jumped from the bridge to the signal bridge though horribly burned by gasoline flames, Chandler helped deploy fire hoses alongside enlisted men to stop the flames and then waited his turn for [[first aid]] with those same ratings. The admiral, his lungs scorched very severely, was beyond help. He died the next day January 7, 1945 in spite of the efforts of the medical department. Admiral Chandler is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Manila Philippines National Cemetery.\n\n==Namesakes==\nTwo ships in the U.S. Navy have been named after Chandler.  In October 1945, the destroyer {{USS|Theodore E. Chandler|DD-717|3}} was named in his honor.  In 1983, the {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer|0}} guided missile destroyer {{USS|Chandler|DDG-996|3}} was named after him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{DANFS}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t4/theodore_e_chandler-i.htm |accessdate=2007-03-04\n|title=Theodore E.

The popularity of i-mode led to other manufacturers competing with similar offerings and therefore developed their own emoji sets. While emoji adoption was high in [[Japan]] during this time, the companies failed to collaborate and come up with a uniform set of emojis to be used across all platforms in the country.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blagdon |first1=Jeff |title=How emoji conquered the world |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/3966140/how-emoji-conquered-the-world |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Universal Coded Character Set]] ([[Unicode]]), overseen by the [[Unicode Consortium]] and [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]], had been established as the international standard for text representation ([[ISO/IEC 10646]]) since 1993, although variants of [[Shift JIS]] remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from [[North America]]n or [[Western Europe]]an sources such as [[ITC Zapf Dingbats]] or [[Code page 437|DOS code page 437]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 1.1 Emoji List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-1.1/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref> but had not incorporated the Japanese cellular emoji characters. Unicode's coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets, although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added. For example, Unicode 4.0 release contained 16 new emojis, which included direction arrows, a yellow warning, and an eject button.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 4.0 List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-4.0/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, other [[dingbat]] fonts such as [[Wingdings]] or [[Webdings]] included additional pictographic symbols in custom [[pi font]] encodings. For example, a [[national park]] pictogram (\ud83c\udfde) was available in Webdings at [[hexadecimal|0x]]50, correspoding to the capital letter [[P (letter)|P]] in [[ASCII]]. Unlike Zapf Dingbats, many of these would not be available as Unicode emoji until 2014.<ref name=\"hexuswebdings\" />\n\n[[The Smiley Company]] developed The Smiley Dictionary, which was launched in 2001.

It wasn't until [[Google]] employees requested that [[Unicode]] look into the possibility of a uniform emoji set did many companies begin to take the emoji seriously. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] quickly followed and began to collaborate with not only [[Google]], but also providers in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]]. In August 2007, [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer wrote the first draft for consideration by the Unicode Technical Committee to introduce emojis into the [[Unicode|Unicode standard]]. Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative efforts from [[Apple Inc.]] shortly after and the official UTC proposal as co-authors came in January 2009. \n\nSeparately, a proposal had been submitted in 2008 to add the [[ARIB STD B24 character set|ARIB extended characters]] used in broadcasting in Japan to Unicode.

The feedback from various bodies in the United States, Europe, and Japan agreed on a set of 722 emojis as the standard set, which would be released in 2010 as Unicode 6.0. This is seen by many as the first true set of uniform emojis due to the sheer number of emojis that were introduced, as only 15% (114) of the 722 emojis can be traced back to emoji sets prior to Unicode 6.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html|title=FAQ \u2013 Emoji & Dingbats|work=unicode.org}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Modern-day emojis (2010\u2013present)===\nThe introduction of the new emojis by [[Unicode]] in 2009, saw the introduction of some of the most notable emojis used today.

When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. Small changes to a character's look may completely alter its perceived meaning with the receiver.\n\n===Controversial emoji===\nSome emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings.

These animoji can also utilize [[lip sync]] to appear to speak audio messages recorded by the sender. Apple had created 3D models of all standard emoji prior to its late-2016 OS updates from which the static default 2D graphics had been rendered.

EmojiOne version 3.1, with a stricter license that disallows the redistribution of vector images, supports Unicode Emoji 5.0, hence characters added in Unicode 10.0. EmojiTwo, an open-source fork of EmojiOne 2.3, aims to add all emoji from 2017 and later.\n\nNote, however, that not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. [[OpenType]] version 1.8 standardizes four different formats for color fonts: one built upon standard glyphs and backed by Microsoft; one built upon [[SVG]] and backed by Mozilla, Adobe, and others; one based upon [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] chunks and backed by Google; and one supporting a variety of embedded image formats, but preferably PNG, backed by Apple. This means that color fonts need to come in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems.\n\nThe font ''Symbola'' contains all emoji through version 10.0 as normal monochrome glyphs. Through version 10, Symbola was a [[Open-source Unicode typefaces|public domain font]]; beginning with version 11 in 2018, Symbola has been copyrighted with a ban on commercial use and derivative works.

[[Mobile phone industry in Japan#Providers|Japanese mobile operators]] NTT DoCoMo, [[au (mobile phone company)|au]], and [[SoftBank Mobile]] (formerly [[Vodafone]]) all implemented emoji sets in the late 1990s to their phones. These companies each defined their own variants of emoji using proprietary standards.

This was aided by the introduction of [[i-mode]], which for many was the origins of the [[smartphone]]. [[i-mode]] also saw the introduction of emojis in conversation form on messenger [[Application software|apps]]. By 2004, [[i-mode]] had 40 million subscribers, meaning numerous people were exposed to the emoji for the first time between 2000 and 2004. The popularity of i-mode led to other manufacturers competing with similar offerings and therefore developed their own emoji sets. While emoji adoption was high in [[Japan]] during this time, the companies failed to collaborate and come up with a uniform set of emojis to be used across all platforms in the country.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blagdon |first1=Jeff |title=How emoji conquered the world |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/3966140/how-emoji-conquered-the-world |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Universal Coded Character Set]] ([[Unicode]]), overseen by the [[Unicode Consortium]] and [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]], had been established as the international standard for text representation ([[ISO/IEC 10646]]) since 1993, although variants of [[Shift JIS]] remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from [[North America]]n or [[Western Europe]]an sources such as [[ITC Zapf Dingbats]] or [[Code page 437|DOS code page 437]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 1.1 Emoji List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-1.1/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref> but had not incorporated the Japanese cellular emoji characters. Unicode's coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets, although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added. For example, Unicode 4.0 release contained 16 new emojis, which included direction arrows, a yellow warning, and an eject button.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 4.0 List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-4.0/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, other [[dingbat]] fonts such as [[Wingdings]] or [[Webdings]] included additional pictographic symbols in custom [[pi font]] encodings.

The feedback from various bodies in the United States, Europe, and Japan agreed on a set of 722 emojis as the standard set, which would be released in 2010 as Unicode 6.0. This is seen by many as the first true set of uniform emojis due to the sheer number of emojis that were introduced, as only 15% (114) of the 722 emojis can be traced back to emoji sets prior to Unicode 6.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html|title=FAQ \u2013 Emoji & Dingbats|work=unicode.org}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Modern-day emojis (2010\u2013present)===\nThe introduction of the new emojis by [[Unicode]] in 2009, saw the introduction of some of the most notable emojis used today.

When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78kzn9/what-the-emoji-youre-sending-actually-look-like-to-your-friends| title=What the Emoji You're Sending Actually Look Like to Your Friends| date=November 12, 2015| publisher=Motherboard| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> (See also [[Models of communication]].)\n\nFor example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively, so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and even obnoxious attitude, as the orbicularis oculi (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the orbicularis oris (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/944693/chinese-people-mean-something-very-different-when-they-send-you-a-smiley-emoji/ |title=Chinese people mean something very different when they send you a smiley emoji |website=Quartz|date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe second problem relates to technology and branding. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way.

These animoji can also utilize [[lip sync]] to appear to speak audio messages recorded by the sender. Apple had created 3D models of all standard emoji prior to its late-2016 OS updates from which the static default 2D graphics had been rendered.

EmojiOne version 3.1, with a stricter license that disallows the redistribution of vector images, supports Unicode Emoji 5.0, hence characters added in Unicode 10.0. EmojiTwo, an open-source fork of EmojiOne 2.3, aims to add all emoji from 2017 and later.\n\nNote, however, that not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. [[OpenType]] version 1.8 standardizes four different formats for color fonts: one built upon standard glyphs and backed by Microsoft; one built upon [[SVG]] and backed by Mozilla, Adobe, and others; one based upon [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] chunks and backed by Google; and one supporting a variety of embedded image formats, but preferably PNG, backed by Apple. This means that color fonts need to come in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems.\n\nThe font ''Symbola'' contains all emoji through version 10.0 as normal monochrome glyphs. Through version 10, Symbola was a [[Open-source Unicode typefaces|public domain font]]; beginning with version 11 in 2018, Symbola has been copyrighted with a ban on commercial use and derivative works.
