More generally, it might be thought to include [[Corkscrew (tool)|corkscrew]]s used to remove cork or plastic stoppers from [[wine bottles]].\n\nA metal bottle cap is affixed to the rim of the neck of a bottle by being pleated or ruffled around the rim. A bottle opener is a specialized [[lever]] inserted beneath the pleated metalwork, which uses a point on the bottle cap as a [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] on which to [[wikt:pivot|pivot]].\n\n==Varieties==\nThere are several distinct designs of such bottle openers. Wall mounted openers are typically found behind [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s in [[Public house|pub]]s, whilst hand-tool bottle openers tend to be found and used in domestic environments. The functional elements of bottle openers (a tooth or lip to catch the underside of the cap, a fulcrum across which to exert the force that will remove the cap, and usually a lever for mechanical advantage) tend to be consistent, although they can vary in design and aesthetics.\n\n[[Image:Bottle Opener.jpg|thumb|A simple bottle opener]]\n===Crown cork opener===\n{{main article|Churchkey}}\nInvented at the same time as the [[crown cork]], it is the original bottle opener. But as well as being portable it also comes as a fixed device to be attached to vertical surfaces, often with a tray to catch the bottle tops. It does not open wine bottles.\n\nA simple opener is a piece of metal with a rectangular or rounded opening in one end and a solid handle large enough to be gripped between the thumb and forefingers on the other. The opening contains a lip that is placed under the edge of the bottle top, pulling it off when upward force is applied to the handle end of the opener.\n\n===Speed opener ('bar blade')===\n[[Image:Bar-blade.jpg|thumb|A [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] branded \"bar blade\", front and back]]\nThe speed opener is a flat blade of steel approximately 4&nbsp;cm wide and 16&nbsp;cm long with a thumb hole at one end and a letterbox cut at the other to remove the crown seals from a bottle. They go under the names 'speed opener', 'popper', 'mamba', \u2018bar key\u2019, and most popularly 'bar blade'. The thumb hole may be used to pull bottles out of ice, by placing the hole over the neck of the bottle, then lifting it.  The speed opener is widely used by professional [[bartender]]s in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Carried in the pocket or against the body or on a zip string, it is both convenient and fast for the modern bartender. It is advantageous in that it is easy to open several bottles in rapid succession, and with more flair than other types of bottle opener. Consequently, 'bar blading' is often part of [[Flair bartending|bar flair]] routines.\n\n===Wall-mounted===\n[[File:Magnetic Bottle Opener.jpg|thumb|Wall-mounted bottle opener with magnet to catch lids]]\nWorks the same as the lever variation, except that it is attached to the wall, to allow for simpler bottle-opening, which can be done with one hand. The bottle cap can fall into a bottle cap catcher mounted below the opener, or you can retrieve it after removal from the bottle. \nA variant to this are similar types of openers mounted on older [[vending machines]].\n\n===Multi-opener===\nAlso known as a [[beverage opener]], these usually includes a bottle opener of the simple bottle opener style but includes various other openers such as for plastic bottles or metal beverage cans.\n{{clear}}\n== Technique ==\nUnder most use, a bottle opener functions as a [[second-class lever]]: the fulcrum is the far end of the bottle opener, placed on the top of the crown, with the output at the near end of the bottle opener, on the crown edge, ''between'' the fulcrum and the hand: in these cases, one pushes ''up'' on the lever.\n\nHowever, one may instead use it as a [[first-class lever]], by placing the near end on the top of the crown, and the far end under the crown edge, then pushing ''down'' on the lever (thus the output is on the ''opposite side'' of the fulcrum from the hand). This is particularly used with bar blades, which form an [[obtuse angle]]. Mechanically, this is a marginally less effective lever, as the effort arm is shorter, but the action of pushing down is marginally anatomically easier.\n\nWhile most lever-type bottle openers can be used in either configuration, the designed use can be determined if one of the edges is curved, in which case this edge is designed to sit in the middle of the crown, as the curve concentrates pressure, deforming the crown, and a curved edge does not connect with as much of the crown edge, hence being suboptimal and slipping more frequently if used to connect with the crown edge. This difference can be seen in comparing the traditional opener and contemporary bar blade at right.\n\n== Corkscrews ==\n{{Main article|Corkscrew}}\n\n===Waiter's friend===\n[[Image:Opened Waiters.JPG|thumb|right|Opened Waiter's Friend]]\nThe 'waiter's friend' or 'wine key' consists of a flat housing (often plastic covered) similar to a [[Swiss army knife]] with a corkscrew and lever (which doubles as crown cork opener) with either a knife or auto-foiler to remove the foil top of wine bottles and then the cork. Designed to be screwed in to within 1 full rotation before the end of the screw (more will pierce the bottom of the cork and result in extra flotsam on the surface of your wine) before levering out the cork.\n\n===Mounted corkscrew===\n{{main|Mounted corkscrew}}\nThis tool is used by businesses that need to open a large volume of wine efficiently and without waste or breakage. It is a large brass tubular device, fixed at a 45\u00b0 angle to the bar, with a lever pivoted halfway and extending towards the user. The bottle's neck is inserted firmly in the lower aperture of the tube and the lever pulled down firmly and steadily to the bottom. This drives a corkscrew into the cork at a regular depth each time. When the lever is returned to its original position it extracts the cork. When the bottle is removed pull the lever to expose the cork at the bottom, it loosens the cork and returns the lever firmly to its starting position, whereupon the cork will then fall out.\n\n===Twin prong cork puller===\n[[Image:ah-so.png|thumb|right|A twin prong cork puller]]\nThe twin prong cork puller, also called the Butler's Friend, is shaped like a large key with a squared oval handle about 5&nbsp;cm \u00d7 8&nbsp;cm, and two thin metal strips, approximately 10&nbsp;cm long, 5&nbsp;mm wide, and 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, descending in tandem from the center of the handle. The two strips are spread open and then wiggled into the space between the cork and the bottle on either side. Once fully in place, a turn and pull of the handle causes friction to turn the cork and pull it out of the bottle.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Bottle openers}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bottle Opener}}\n[[Category:Bottles]]\n[[Category:Cooking utensils]]\n[[Category:Domestic implements]]\n", "text_old": "{{unsourced|date=August 2019}}\n<!-- commented out for now {{otheruses4|openers for [[crown cap]]s, especially on beer bottles|openers for wine bottles|Corkscrew}} -->\n{|align=\"right\"\n|[[File:Kronkorken.gif|thumb|Using a bottle opener]]\n|}\n\nA '''bottle opener''' is a device that enables the removal of [[Crown cork|metal bottle cap]]s from glass bottles.

Alfieri, Bindo, and Ernesto built 2-litre Grand Prix cars for [[Diatto]]. In 1926, Diatto suspended the production of race cars, leading to the creation of the first Maserati and the founding of the Maserati marque. One of the first Maseratis, driven by Alfieri, won the 1926 [[Targa Florio]]. Maserati began making race cars with 4, 6, 8, and 16 cylinders (two straight-eights mounted parallel to one another).\n\n[[File:037006698 fontananettuno bologna 2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Piazza Maggiore]]'s [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and his trident]]\nThe [[trident]] logo of the Maserati car company, designed by Mario Maserati, is based on the [[Fountain of Neptune, Bologna|Fountain of Neptune]] in [[Bologna]]'s [[Piazza Maggiore]]. In 1920, one of the Maserati brothers used this symbol in the logo at the suggestion of family friend Marquis Diego de Sterlich. It was considered particularly appropriate for the sports car company due to the fact that Neptune represents strength and vigour; additionally the statue is a characteristic symbol of the company's original home city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maserati100.com/history/timeline.html |title=Maserati &#124; 100 Years &#124; History Timeline |website=Maserati100.com |publisher=Maserati |accessdate=22 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlfieri Maserati died in 1932, but three other brothers, Bindo, Ernesto, and Ettore kept the firm going.\n\n===Orsi ownership===\nIn 1937, the remaining Maserati brothers sold their shares in the company to the [[Adolfo Orsi]] family, who, in 1940, relocated the company headquarters to their home town of [[Modena]],<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> where it remains to this day. The brothers continued in engineering roles with the company. Racing successes continued, even against the giants of German racing, [[Audi|Auto Union]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]]. In back-to-back wins in 1939 and 1940, an 8CTF won the [[Indianapolis 500]], making Maserati the only Italian manufacturer ever to do so.<ref>{{HAER |survey=IN-112 |id=in0543 |title=1938 Maserati 8.C.T.F., Indianapolis, Marion County, IN |photos=37 |color=4 |data=23 |cap=2}}</ref>\n\nThe second world war then intervened and Maserati abandoned car making to produce components for the Italian war effort. During this time, Maserati worked in fierce competition to construct a V16 [[town car]] for [[Benito Mussolini]] before [[Ferry Porsche]] of [[Volkswagen]] built one for [[Adolf Hitler]]. This failed, and the plans were scrapped. Once peace was restored, Maserati returned to making cars; the [[Maserati A6|A6]] series did well in the post-war racing scene.\n\n[[File:Fangio & Maserati 250F.jpg|thumb|[[Juan-Manuel Fangio]] driving a [[Maserati 250F]].]]\n\nKey people joined the Maserati team. [[Alberto Massimino]], a former FIAT engineer with both Alfa Romeo and Ferrari experience, oversaw the design of all racing models for the next ten years. With him joined engineers [[Giulio Alfieri]], [[Vittorio Bellentani]], and [[Gioacchino Colombo]]. The focus was on the best engines and chassis to succeed in car racing. These new projects saw the last contributions of the Maserati brothers, who, after their 10-year contract with Orsi expired, went on to form [[O.S.C.A.]]. This new team at Maserati worked on several projects: the [[Maserati 4CLT|4CLT]], the [[Maserati A6|A6]] series, the 8CLT, and, pivotally for the future success of the company, the [[Maserati A6GCS|A6GCS]].\n\nThe famous Argentinian grand prix driver [[Juan-Manuel Fangio]] raced for Maserati for a number of years in the 1950s, achieving a number of stunning victories including winning the world championship in 1957 in the [[Maserati 250F|250F]]. Other racing projects in the 1950s were the [[Maserati 200S|200S]], [[Maserati 300S|300S]], [[Maserati 350S|350S]], and [[Maserati 450S|450S]], followed in 1961 by the famous [[Maserati Birdcage|''Tipo'' 61]].\n\n====Withdrawal from racing====\nMaserati retired from factory racing participation because of the ''[[Guidizzolo]] tragedy''{{efn|During the 1957 [[Mille Miglia]], near the town of [[Guidizzolo]], a 4.2-litre Ferrari travelling at {{convert|250|km/h}} blew a tire and crashed into the roadside crowd, killing the driver - [[Alfonso de Portago]], the co-driver, and ten spectators, including five children. In response, [[Enzo Ferrari]] was charged with manslaughter in a lengthy criminal prosecution that was finally dismissed in 1961.}} during the 1957 [[Mille Miglia]], though they continued to build cars for [[privateer (motorsport)|privateer]]s. Maserati became more and more focused on building road-going [[grand tourer]]s.\n\n[[File:1960 Maserati 3500 GT coupe - white - fvr.jpg|thumb|A 1960 [[Maserati 3500 GT]]]]\n\nThe 1957 [[Maserati 3500 GT|3500 GT]] marked a turning point in the marque's history, as its first ground-up [[grand tourer]] design and first series-produced car.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Production jumped from a dozen to a few hundred cars a year.\nChief engineer [[Giulio Alfieri]] took charge of the project and turned the 3.5-litre [[inline-six engine|inline six]] from the [[Maserati 350S|350S]] into a road-going engine. Launched with a [[Carrozzeria Touring]] 2+2 coup\u00e9 aluminium body over [[superleggera]] structure, a steel-bodied short wheelbase [[Vignale]] 3500 GT Convertible [[Convertible|open top]] version followed in 1960. The 3500 GT's success, with over 2,200 made, was critical to Maserati's survival in the years following withdrawal from racing.\n\nThe 3500 GT also provided the underpinnings for the small-volume V8-engined [[Maserati 5000 GT|5000 GT]], another seminal car for Maserati. Born from the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Persia]]'s whim of owning a road car powered by the [[Maserati 450S]] racing engine, it became one of the fastest and most expensive cars of its days. The third to the thirty-fourth and last example produced were powered by Maserati's first purely road-going V8 engine design.\n\n[[File:Maserati Ghibli green.jpg|thumb|left|The svelte [[Maserati Ghibli|Ghibli]]]]\n\nIn 1962, the 3500 GT evolved into the [[Maserati Sebring|Sebring]], bodied by [[Vignale]] and based on the ''Convertibile'' chassis. Next came the two-seater [[Maserati Mistral|Mistral]] coup\u00e9 in 1963 and Spider in 1964, both six-cylinder powered and styled by [[Pietro Frua]].\n\nAlso in 1963, the company's first [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] arrived, the [[Maserati Quattroporte|Quattroporte]], also styled by Frua. If the 5000 GT inaugurated the marque's first road-going V8, the Quattroporte's ''Tipo 107'' 4.2-litre [[DOHC]] V8 was the forefather of all Maserati V8s up to 1990.\n\nThe [[Ghia]]-designed [[Maserati Ghibli|Ghibli]] coup\u00e9 was launched in 1967.

This engine, descending from Alfieri's 90\u00b0 V6, was fitted in a large number of models, all sharing key components; every new Maserati launched up to the 1990s would derive from the Biturbo's platform.\nThe Biturbo family was extremely successful at exploiting the [[Aspirational brand|aspirational image]] of the ''Maserati'' name\u2014selling 40,000 units.\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, the range was extended to include [[Sedan (car)|saloons]] (the 425 and 420) and a [[cabriolet]] (the [[Zagato]]-bodied Spyder), respectively on a long and short wheelbase of the Biturbo platform.\n\nDuring 1984, [[Chrysler]] bought a 5% share in Maserati. Following an agreement between De Tomaso's friend and Chrysler head [[Lee Iacocca]], a [[joint venture]] was signed. Maserati would go on to produce a car for export to the American market, the [[Chrysler TC by Maserati]], with Chrysler-sourced engines. In July of that same year, a [[merger]] between Maserati and Nuova Innocenti was decided; it was carried out in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1985/06/16/de-tomaso-perfeziona-la-fusione-tra-maserati.html |title=De Tomaso perfeziona la fusione tra Maserati e Nuova Innocenti |first=Giorgio |last=Lonardi |date=16 June 1985 |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> Chrysler upped its stake to 15.6% by underwriting three quarters of a 75 billion [[Italian Lira|Lire]] capital raise in 1986.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1986/05/29/chrysler-sbarca-in-italia.html |title=Chrysler sbarca in Italia |first=Giorgio |last=Lonardi |date=29 May 1986 |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nNew Biturbo-based cars and model evolutions were launched year after year. In 1984, it was the 228, a large coup\u00e9 built on the long wheelbase saloon chassis, with a new 2.8-litre version of the twin-turbocharged V6. [[Weber carburetors|Weber]] [[Fuel injection]] was phased in starting in 1986, bringing improved reliability and a host of new model variants. The same year, the ageing Quattroporte III was updated and marketed as the luxurious [[Maserati Quattroporte#Royale|Royale]], built to order in an handful of examples a year; its discontinuation in 1990 marked the disappearance of Maserati's four-cam V8 engine, a design that could trace its roots back to the 450S racer and the legendary 5000 GT.\nIn 1987, the 2.8-litre 430 topped the saloon range. 1988 brought the [[Maserati Karif|Karif]], a two-seater, based on the short wheelbase Spyder chassis. Meanwhile, the Biturbo name was dropped altogether, as updated coup\u00e9s and saloons were updated and became the 222 and 422. \n1989 marked the reintroduction of an eight-cylinder grand tourer: the [[Maserati Shamal|Shamal]], built on a modified short wheelbase Biturbo chassis, clad in new muscular bodywork styled by [[Marcello Gandini]]. It was powered by an all-new twin-turbocharged 32-valve V8 engine paired to a 6-speed gearbox. 2.0-litre, 24-valve V6 engines were also added to the Shamal range.\n\n====De Tomaso-FIAT years====\nIn October 1989, De Tomaso bought the remaining GEPI quota. In December, [[Fiat S.p.A.|FIAT]] entered in Maserati's history. Maserati and Innocenti were separated; Innocenti Milano S.p.A., the company that sold Innocenti cars, continued its business under a 51% FIAT Auto ownership. All of the [[Modena]] and [[Lambrate]] plants went to a newly created company, the still existent Maserati S.p.A.; 49% of it was owned by FIAT Auto and 51% was controlled by De Tomaso through the old company, Officine Alfieri Maserati.<ref name=\"stampa fiat89\">{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,0952_01_1989_0282_0013_24118345/ |title=Anche la Biturbo nell'orbita della Fiat |first=Renzo |last=Villare |date=8 December 1989 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"repubblica fiat89\">{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/12/08/anche-la-maserati-nell-impero-fiat.html|title=Anche la Maserati nell'impero Fiat |first=Salvatore |last=Tropea |date=8 December 1989 |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the early '90s, a [[mid-engine]] sports car was developed, the Chubasco\u2014which was to d\u00e9but in 1992.

Alfieri, Bindo, and Ernesto built 2-litre Grand Prix cars for [[Diatto]]. In 1926, Diatto suspended the production of race cars, leading to the creation of the first Maserati and the founding of the Maserati marque. One of the first Maseratis, driven by Alfieri, won the 1926 [[Targa Florio]]. Maserati began making race cars with 4, 6, 8, and 16 cylinders (two straight-eights mounted parallel to one another).\n\n[[File:037006698 fontananettuno bologna 2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Piazza Maggiore]]'s [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and his trident]]\nThe [[trident]] logo of the Maserati car company, designed by Mario Maserati, is based on the [[Fountain of Neptune, Bologna|Fountain of Neptune]] in [[Bologna]]'s [[Piazza Maggiore]]. In 1920, one of the Maserati brothers, used this symbol in the logo at the suggestion of family friend Marquis Diego de Sterlich. It was considered particularly appropriate for the sports car company due to the fact that Neptune represents strength and vigour; additionally the statue is a characteristic symbol of the company's original home city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maserati100.com/history/timeline.html |title=Maserati &#124; 100 Years &#124; History Timeline |website=Maserati100.com |publisher=Maserati |accessdate=22 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlfieri Maserati died in 1932, but three other brothers, Bindo, Ernesto, and Ettore kept the firm going.\n\n===Orsi ownership===\nIn 1937, the remaining Maserati brothers sold their shares in the company to the [[Adolfo Orsi]] family, who, in 1940, relocated the company headquarters to their home town of [[Modena]],<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> where it remains to this day. The brothers continued in engineering roles with the company. Racing successes continued, even against the giants of German racing, [[Audi|Auto Union]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]]. In back-to-back wins in 1939 and 1940, an 8CTF won the [[Indianapolis 500]], making Maserati the only Italian manufacturer ever to do so.<ref>{{HAER |survey=IN-112 |id=in0543 |title=1938 Maserati 8.C.T.F., Indianapolis, Marion County, IN |photos=37 |color=4 |data=23 |cap=2}}</ref>\n\nThe second world war then intervened and Maserati abandoned car making to produce components for the Italian war effort. During this time, Maserati worked in fierce competition to construct a V16 [[town car]] for [[Benito Mussolini]] before [[Ferry Porsche]] of [[Volkswagen]] built one for [[Adolf Hitler]]. This failed, and the plans were scrapped. Once peace was restored, Maserati returned to making cars; the [[Maserati A6|A6]] series did well in the post-war racing scene.\n\n[[File:Fangio & Maserati 250F.jpg|thumb|[[Juan-Manuel Fangio]] driving a [[Maserati 250F]].]]\n\nKey people joined the Maserati team. [[Alberto Massimino]], a former FIAT engineer with both Alfa Romeo and Ferrari experience, oversaw the design of all racing models for the next ten years. With him joined engineers [[Giulio Alfieri]], [[Vittorio Bellentani]], and [[Gioacchino Colombo]]. The focus was on the best engines and chassis to succeed in car racing. These new projects saw the last contributions of the Maserati brothers, who, after their 10-year contract with Orsi expired, went on to form [[O.S.C.A.]]. This new team at Maserati worked on several projects: the [[Maserati 4CLT|4CLT]], the [[Maserati A6|A6]] series, the 8CLT, and, pivotally for the future success of the company, the [[Maserati A6GCS|A6GCS]].\n\nThe famous Argentinian grand prix driver [[Juan-Manuel Fangio]] raced for Maserati for a number of years in the 1950s, achieving a number of stunning victories including winning the world championship in 1957 in the [[Maserati 250F|250F]]. Other racing projects in the 1950s were the [[Maserati 200S|200S]], [[Maserati 300S|300S]], [[Maserati 350S|350S]], and [[Maserati 450S|450S]], followed in 1961 by the famous [[Maserati Birdcage|''Tipo'' 61]].\n\n====Withdrawal from racing====\nMaserati retired from factory racing participation because of the ''[[Guidizzolo]] tragedy''{{efn|During the 1957 [[Mille Miglia]], near the town of [[Guidizzolo]], a 4.2-litre Ferrari travelling at {{convert|250|km/h}} blew a tire and crashed into the roadside crowd, killing the driver - [[Alfonso de Portago]], the co-driver, and ten spectators, including five children. In response, [[Enzo Ferrari]] was charged with manslaughter in a lengthy criminal prosecution that was finally dismissed in 1961.}} during the 1957 [[Mille Miglia]], though they continued to build cars for [[privateer (motorsport)|privateer]]s. Maserati became more and more focused on building road-going [[grand tourer]]s.\n\n[[File:1960 Maserati 3500 GT coupe - white - fvr.jpg|thumb|A 1960 [[Maserati 3500 GT]]]]\n\nThe 1957 [[Maserati 3500 GT|3500 GT]] marked a turning point in the marque's history, as its first ground-up [[grand tourer]] design and first series-produced car.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Production jumped from a dozen to a few hundred cars a year.\nChief engineer [[Giulio Alfieri]] took charge of the project and turned the 3.5-litre [[inline-six engine|inline six]] from the [[Maserati 350S|350S]] into a road-going engine. Launched with a [[Carrozzeria Touring]] 2+2 coup\u00e9 aluminium body over [[superleggera]] structure, a steel-bodied short wheelbase [[Vignale]] 3500 GT Convertible [[Convertible|open top]] version followed in 1960. The 3500 GT's success, with over 2,200 made, was critical to Maserati's survival in the years following withdrawal from racing.\n\nThe 3500 GT also provided the underpinnings for the small-volume V8-engined [[Maserati 5000 GT|5000 GT]], another seminal car for Maserati. Born from the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Persia]]'s whim of owning a road car powered by the [[Maserati 450S]] racing engine, it became one of the fastest and most expensive cars of its days. The third to the thirty-fourth and last example produced were powered by Maserati's first purely road-going V8 engine design.\n\n[[File:Maserati Ghibli green.jpg|thumb|left|The svelte [[Maserati Ghibli|Ghibli]]]]\n\nIn 1962, the 3500 GT evolved into the [[Maserati Sebring|Sebring]], bodied by [[Vignale]] and based on the ''Convertibile'' chassis. Next came the two-seater [[Maserati Mistral|Mistral]] coup\u00e9 in 1963 and Spider in 1964, both six-cylinder powered and styled by [[Pietro Frua]].\n\nAlso in 1963, the company's first [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] arrived, the [[Maserati Quattroporte|Quattroporte]], also styled by Frua. If the 5000 GT inaugurated the marque's first road-going V8, the Quattroporte's ''Tipo 107'' 4.2-litre [[DOHC]] V8 was the forefather of all Maserati V8s up to 1990.\n\nThe [[Ghia]]-designed [[Maserati Ghibli|Ghibli]] coup\u00e9 was launched in 1967. It was powered by a 4.7-litre [[dry sump]] version of Maserati's quad cam V8. The Ghibli Spyder and 4.9-litre Ghibli SS followed.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn ownership===\nIn 1968, Maserati was taken over by [[Citro\u00ebn]].

This engine, descending from Alfieri's 90\u00b0 V6, was fitted in a large number of models, all sharing key components; every new Maserati launched up to the 1990s would derive from the Biturbo's platform.\nThe Biturbo family was extremely successful at exploiting the [[Aspirational brand|aspirational image]] of the ''Maserati'' name\u2014selling 40,000 units.\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, the range was extended to include [[Sedan (car)|saloons]] (the 425 and 420) and a [[cabriolet]] (the [[Zagato]]-bodied Spyder), respectively on a long and short wheelbase of the Biturbo platform.\n\nDuring 1984, [[Chrysler]] bought a 5% share in Maserati. Following an agreement between De Tomaso's friend and Chrysler head [[Lee Iacocca]], a [[joint venture]] was signed. Maserati would go on to produce a car for export to the American market, the [[Chrysler TC by Maserati]], with Chrysler-sourced engines. In July of that same year, a [[merger]] between Maserati and Nuova Innocenti was decided; it was carried out in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1985/06/16/de-tomaso-perfeziona-la-fusione-tra-maserati.html |title=De Tomaso perfeziona la fusione tra Maserati e Nuova Innocenti |first=Giorgio |last=Lonardi |date=16 June 1985 |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> Chrysler upped its stake to 15.6% by underwriting three quarters of a 75 billion [[Italian Lira|Lire]] capital raise in 1986.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1986/05/29/chrysler-sbarca-in-italia.html |title=Chrysler sbarca in Italia |first=Giorgio |last=Lonardi |date=29 May 1986 |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nNew Biturbo-based cars and model evolutions were launched year after year. In 1984, it was the 228, a large coup\u00e9 built on the long wheelbase saloon chassis, with a new 2.8-litre version of the twin-turbocharged V6. [[Weber carburetors|Weber]] [[Fuel injection]] was phased in starting in 1986, bringing improved reliability and a host of new model variants. The same year, the ageing Quattroporte III was updated and marketed as the luxurious [[Maserati Quattroporte#Royale|Royale]], built to order in an handful of examples a year; its discontinuation in 1990 marked the disappearance of Maserati's four-cam V8 engine, a design that could trace its roots back to the 450S racer and the legendary 5000 GT.\nIn 1987, the 2.8-litre 430 topped the saloon range. 1988 brought the [[Maserati Karif|Karif]], a two-seater, based on the short wheelbase Spyder chassis. Meanwhile, the Biturbo name was dropped altogether, as updated coup\u00e9s and saloons were updated and became the 222 and 422. \n1989 marked the reintroduction of an eight-cylinder grand tourer: the [[Maserati Shamal|Shamal]], built on a modified short wheelbase Biturbo chassis, clad in new muscular bodywork styled by [[Marcello Gandini]]. It was powered by an all-new twin-turbocharged 32-valve V8 engine paired to a 6-speed gearbox. 2.0-litre, 24-valve V6 engines were also added to the Shamal range.\n\n====De Tomaso-FIAT years====\nIn October 1989, De Tomaso bought the remaining GEPI quota. In December, [[Fiat S.p.A.|FIAT]] entered in Maserati's history. Maserati and Innocenti were separated; Innocenti Milano S.p.A., the company that sold Innocenti cars, continued its business under a 51% FIAT Auto ownership. All of the [[Modena]] and [[Lambrate]] plants went to a newly created company, the still existent Maserati S.p.A.; 49% of it was owned by FIAT Auto and 51% was controlled by De Tomaso through the old company, Officine Alfieri Maserati.<ref name=\"stampa fiat89\">{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,0952_01_1989_0282_0013_24118345/ |title=Anche la Biturbo nell'orbita della Fiat |first=Renzo |last=Villare |date=8 December 1989 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"repubblica fiat89\">{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/12/08/anche-la-maserati-nell-impero-fiat.html|title=Anche la Maserati nell'impero Fiat |first=Salvatore |last=Tropea |date=8 December 1989 |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |language=it |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the early '90s, a [[mid-engine]] sports car was developed, the Chubasco\u2014which was to d\u00e9but in 1992.

The last version of the Biturbo coup\u00e9 was called  Racing. It was a transitional model in which several features to be found on the upcoming Ghibli were tested.\n\nThe [[Maserati Ghibli#Ghibli II|Ghibli II]] was introduced in 1992. It was a six-cylinder coup\u00e9, with modified Biturbo underpinnings dressed by new Gandini bodywork (toned down from the Shamal) and the latest evolution of the 24-valve twin-turbocharged V6 with record breaking specific output.\nThe underpinnings of the stillborn Chubasco gave birth to the [[Maserati Barchetta]], a small open top mid-engine sports car styled by Synthesis Design's Carlo Gaino.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.synthesisdesign.it/barchetta.html |title=Synthesis design - Maserati Barchetta |website=dynthesisdesign.it |accessdate=20 October 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68vV4CSRF?url=http://www.synthesisdesign.it/barchetta.html |archive-date=5 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A [[Auto racing#One-make racing|one-make racing series]] was held in 1992 and 1993, using the Barchetta Corsa racing version; the road-going Barchetta Stradale was never put into production.

Both the store and the publishers became widely known following the obscenity trial of Ferlinghetti for publishing [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s influential collection ''[[Howl and Other Poems]]'' (City Lights, 1956). [[Nancy Peters]] started working there in 1971 and retired as executive director in 2007. In 2001, City Lights was made an official historic landmark. City Lights is located at 261 Columbus Avenue in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], near the border of [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].\n[[File:City Lights outside.jpg|right|thumb|City Lights Bookstore - outside, 2013]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early years===\nCity Lights was the inspiration of Peter D. Martin, who relocated from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]] in the 1940s to teach sociology. He first used City Lights\u2014in homage to [[City Lights|the Chaplin film]]\u2014in 1952 as the title of a magazine, publishing early work by such key Bay Area writers as [[Philip Lamantia]], [[Pauline Kael]], [[Jack Spicer]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], and [[Ferlinghetti]] himself, as \"Lawrence Ferling\". A year later, Martin used the name to establish the first all-paperback bookstore in the U.S., at the time an audacious idea.\n[[Image:Ferlinghetti.jpg|thumb|[[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] at City Lights in 2007]]\nThe site was a tiny storefront in the triangular Artigues Building located at 261 Columbus Avenue, near the intersection of Broadway in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]]. Built on the ruins of a previous building destroyed in the fire following the 1906 earthquake, the building was designed by Oliver Everett in 1907 and named for its owners. City Lights originally shared the building with a number of other shops. It gradually gained more space whenever one of the other shops became vacant, and eventually occupied the entire building.\n\nIn 1953, as Ferlinghetti was walking past the Artigues Building, he encountered Martin out front hanging up a sign that announced a \"Pocket Book Shop.\" He introduced himself as a contributor to Martin's magazine ''City Lights'', and told him he had always wanted a bookstore. Before long he and Martin agreed to a partnership. Each man invested $500. Soon after they opened they hired [[Shig Murao]] as a clerk. Murao worked without pay for the first few weeks, but eventually became manager of the store and was a key element in creating the unique feel of City Lights.<ref>Shawn Hubler, \"City Lights Illuminates the Past\", ''Los Angeles Times'',  May 27, 2003.</ref> In 1955, Martin sold his share of the business to Ferlinghetti for $1000, moved to New York and started the New Yorker Bookstore which specialized in cinema.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Ferlinghetti hired Joseph Wolberg, former philosophy professor at SUNY Buffalo, to manage the bookstore. Wolberg is credited with organizing the once chaotically messy shelves and for convincing a cheap Ferlinghetti to install anti-shoplifting metal detectors. Through his connection to City Lights, Wolberg produced records for Beat poets such as [[Charles Bukowski]] and [[Shel Silverstein]].\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nIn 1971, Ferlinghetti persuaded Nancy Peters \u2013 who was working at the [[Library of Congress]] \u2013 to join in a project with him, after which she began full-time work at City Lights.<ref name=tour>Morgan, Bill, [http://www.citylights.com/bookstore/?fa=books_tour \"City Lights bookshop tour\"], City Lights.

It offers three floors of new-release hardcovers and paperbacks from all major publishers, as well as a large selection of titles from smaller, independent publishers. City Lights is a member of the [[American Booksellers Association]].\n\n==Publishing==\nIn [[1955 in literature|1955]], Ferlinghetti launched City Lights Publishers with his own ''Pictures of the Gone World'', the first number in the [[City Lights Pocket Poets Series|Pocket Poets Series]]. This was followed in quick succession by ''Thirty Spanish Poems of Love and Exile'' translated by [[Kenneth Rexroth]] and ''Poems of Humor & Protest'' by [[Kenneth Patchen]], but it was the impact of the fourth volume, ''[[Howl|Howl and Other Poems]]'' ([[1956 in literature|1956]]) by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that brought national attention to the author and publisher.\n\nCity Lights Journal published poems of the Indian [[Hungry generation]] writers when the group faced police case in Kolkata. The group got worldwide publicity thereafter.\n\nApart from Ginsberg's seven collections, a number of the early Pocket Poets volumes brought out by Ferlinghetti have attained the status of classics, including ''True Minds'' by Marie Ponsot ([[1957 in literature|1957]]), ''Here and Now'' by Denise Levertov ([[1958 in literature|1958]]), ''Gasoline'' ([[1958 in literature|1958]]) by [[Gregory Corso]], ''Selected Poems'' by [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]] ([[1959 in literature|1959]]), ''[[Lunch Poems]]'' ([[1964 in literature|1964]]) by [[Frank O'Hara]],'' Selected Poems'' ([[1967 in literature|1967]]) by [[Philip Lamantia]], ''Poems to Fernando'' ([[1968 in literature|1968]]) by [[Janine Pommy Vega]], ''Golden Sardine'' ([[1969 in literature|1969]]) by [[Bob Kaufman]], and ''Revolutionary Letters'' ([[1971 in literature|1971]]) by [[Diane di Prima]].\n\nIn 1967 the publishing operation moved to 1562 Grant Avenue. [[Dick McBride (poet)|Dick McBride]] ran this part of the business with his brother Bob McBride and Martin Broadley for several years.<ref>Ferlinghetti, L & Morgan, B \"The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour\" City Lights Books, 2003 {{ISBN|0-87286-417-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Nancy Peters joined Ferlinghetti as co-editor and publisher.

In addition to books by [[Beat Generation]] authors, the press publishes literary work by such authors as [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Rikki Ducornet]], [[Paul Bowles]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Andrei Voznesensky]], [[Nathaniel Mackey]], [[Alejandro Murgu\u00eda]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Ernesto Cardenal]], [[Daisy Zamora]], [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Kamau Da\u00e1ood]], [[Masha Tupitsyn]], and [[Rebecca Brown (author)|Rebecca Brown]].

[[William Carlos Williams]] \u2014 who was Ginsberg's childhood Pediatrician and himself a future Pocket Poet with a 1957 edition of his early modernist classic, ''Kora in Hell'' ([[1920 in literature|1920]]) \u2014 was recruited for an introduction, perhaps to lend literary justification to ''Howl'''s depictions of drug use and homosexuality. Prior to publication, Ferlinghetti had asked, and received, assurance from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] that the organization would defend him, should he be prosecuted for obscenity.\n\nPublished in November 1956, ''Howl'' was not long in generating controversy. In March 1957, local Collector of Customs Chester MacPhee seized a shipment from England of the book's second printing on grounds of obscenity, but he was compelled to release the books when federal authorities refused to confirm his charge. But the troubles were just beginning, for in June of that year, local police raided City Lights Bookstore and arrested store manager [[Shig Murao|Shigeyoshi Murao]] on the charge of offering an obscene book for sale. Ferlinghetti, then in [[Big Sur]], turned himself in on his return to San Francisco. Both faced a possible $500 fine and a 6-month sentence. (Ginsberg was in Tangiers at the time, and not charged.) The ACLU posted bail, assigned defense counsel [[Al Bendich|Albert Bendich]] to the case, and secured the pro bono services of famous criminal defense lawyer J. W. Ehrlich.\n\nThe municipal court trial, presided over by Judge [[Clayton W. Horn]], ran from August 16 to September 3, 1957. The charges against Murao were dismissed since it couldn't be proved that he knew what was in the book. Then, during the trial of Ferlinghetti, respected writers and professors testified for the defense. Judge Horn rendered his precedent-setting verdict, declaring that ''Howl'' was not obscene and that a book with \"the slightest redeeming social importance\" guarantees [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection. Horn's decision established the precedent that paved the way for the publication of such hitherto banned books as [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]''. The media attention resulting from the trial stimulated national interest, and, by 1958, there were 20,000 copies in print. Today there are over a million. Ginsberg continued to publish his major books of poetry with the press for the next 25 years. Even after the publication by [[Harper & Row]] of his ''Collected Poems'' in 1980, he would continue his warm association with City Lights, which served as his local base of operations, for the rest of his life.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Books}}\n* [[List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.citylights.com/}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080321115758/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/books/news/06/27/beat.establishment/ Landmark status likely for beatnik-era bookstore], a June 2001 [[CNN]] article\n*[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2000/06/21/MN24339.DTL And the Beats Go On], a June 2001 article from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''\n*[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5758 Poetry Landmark: The City Lights Bookstore], from the website of the [[Academy of American Poets]]\n*[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt5489q50w/ Guide to the records of City Lights Books] at [[The Bancroft Library]]\n\n[[Category:City Lights Books| ]]\n[[Category:Bookstores in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Beat Generation]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Independent bookstores of the United States]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Retail buildings in California]]\n[[Category:Book publishing companies based in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Bookstores established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1953]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Designated Landmarks]]\n[[Category:Chinatown, San Francisco]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox building\n| name               = City Lights Bookstore\n| image              = City Lights Bookstore.jpg\n| caption            =City Lights Bookstore, 2010\n| alternate_names    = \n | map_type            = San Francisco County#California#USA\n| location           = 261-271 Columbus Avenue<br>[[San Francisco]], [[California]]\n| coordinates        = {{coord|37.797628|-122.406575|region:US_type:landmark|display=title, inline}}\n| completion_date    = \n| building_type      = Commercial\n| floor_count        = \n| floor_area         = \n| architect          = \n| structural_engineer= \n| main_contractor    = \n| developer          = \n| owner              = \n| management         = \n| embedded           = {{designation list|embed=yes|designation1=SFDL|designation1_number=228|designation1_date=2001<ref name=SFLandmark>{{cite web|title=City of San Francisco Designated Landmarks|publisher=City of San Francisco|url=http://www.sf-planning.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=5081|accessdate=2012-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325040805/http://sf-planning.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=5081|archive-date=2014-03-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n| references         = \n}}\n'''City Lights''' is an [[independent bookstore]]-[[publisher]] combination in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], that specializes in [[world literature]], the arts, and [[progressive politics]].

Both the store and the publishers became widely known following the obscenity trial of Ferlinghetti for publishing [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s influential collection ''[[Howl and Other Poems]]'' (City Lights, 1956). [[Nancy Peters]] started working there in 1971 and retired as executive director in 2007. In 2001, City Lights was made an official historic landmark. City Lights is located at 261 Columbus Avenue in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], near the border of [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].\n[[File:City Lights outside.jpg|right|thumb|City Lights Bookstore - outside, 2013]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early years===\nCity Lights was the inspiration of Peter D. Martin, who relocated from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]] in the 1940s to teach sociology. He first used City Lights\u2014in homage to [[City Lights|the Chaplin film]]\u2014in 1952 as the title of a magazine, publishing early work by such key Bay Area writers as [[Philip Lamantia]], [[Pauline Kael]], [[Jack Spicer]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], and [[Ferlinghetti]] himself, as \"Lawrence Ferling\". A year later, Martin used the name to establish the first all-paperback bookstore in the U.S., at the time an audacious idea.\n[[Image:Ferlinghetti.jpg|thumb|[[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] at City Lights in 2007]]\nThe site was a tiny storefront in the triangular Artigues Building located at 261 Columbus Avenue, near the intersection of Broadway in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]]. Built on the ruins of a previous building destroyed in the fire following the 1906 earthquake, the building was designed by Oliver Everett in 1907 and named for its owners. City Lights originally shared the building with a number of other shops. It gradually gained more space whenever one of the other shops became vacant, and eventually occupied the entire building.\n\nIn 1953, as Ferlinghetti was walking past the Artigues Building, he encountered Martin out front hanging up a sign that announced a \"Pocket Book Shop.\" He introduced himself as a contributor to Martin's magazine ''City Lights'', and told him he had always wanted a bookstore. Before long he and Martin agreed to a partnership. Each man invested $500. Soon after they opened they hired [[Shig Murao]] as a clerk. Murao worked without pay for the first few weeks, but eventually became manager of the store and was a key element in creating the unique feel of City Lights.<ref>Shawn Hubler, \"City Lights Illuminates the Past\", ''Los Angeles Times'',  May 27, 2003.</ref> In 1955, Martin sold his share of the business to Ferlinghetti for $1000, moved to New York and started the New Yorker Bookstore which specialized in cinema.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Ferlinghetti hired Joseph Wolberg, former philosophy professor at SUNY Buffalo, to manage the bookstore. Wolberg is credited with organizing the once chaotically messy shelves and for convincing a cheap Ferlinghetti to install anti-shoplifting metal detectors. Through his connection to City Lights, Wolberg produced records for Beat poets such as Charles Bukowski and Shel Silverstein.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nIn 1971, Ferlinghetti persuaded Nancy Peters \u2013 who was working at the [[Library of Congress]] \u2013 to join in a project with him, after which she began full-time work at City Lights.<ref name=tour>Morgan, Bill, [http://www.citylights.com/bookstore/?fa=books_tour \"City Lights bookshop tour\"], City Lights.

This was followed in quick succession by ''Thirty Spanish Poems of Love and Exile'' translated by [[Kenneth Rexroth]] and ''Poems of Humor & Protest'' by [[Kenneth Patchen]], but it was the impact of the fourth volume, ''[[Howl|Howl and Other Poems]]'' ([[1956 in literature|1956]]) by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that brought national attention to the author and publisher.\n\nCity Lights Journal published poems of the Indian [[Hungry generation]] writers when the group faced police case in Kolkata. The group got worldwide publicity thereafter.\n\nApart from Ginsberg's seven collections, a number of the early Pocket Poets volumes brought out by Ferlinghetti have attained the status of classics, including ''True Minds'' by Marie Ponsot ([[1957 in literature|1957]]), ''Here and Now'' by Denise Levertov ([[1958 in literature|1958]]), ''Gasoline'' ([[1958 in literature|1958]]) by [[Gregory Corso]], ''Selected Poems'' by [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]] ([[1959 in literature|1959]]), ''[[Lunch Poems]]'' ([[1964 in literature|1964]]) by [[Frank O'Hara]],'' Selected Poems'' ([[1967 in literature|1967]]) by [[Philip Lamantia]], ''Poems to Fernando'' ([[1968 in literature|1968]]) by [[Janine Pommy Vega]], ''Golden Sardine'' ([[1969 in literature|1969]]) by [[Bob Kaufman]], and ''Revolutionary Letters'' ([[1971 in literature|1971]]) by [[Diane di Prima]].\n\nIn 1967 the publishing operation moved to 1562 Grant Avenue.

About 1,400 of the 2,100 inhabitants of Friedenweiler live in R\u00f6tenbach.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:R\u00f6tenbach panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|R\u00f6tenbach (2004)]]\nR\u00f6tenbach lies about 7&nbsp;km east of [[Titisee-Neustadt]] in the southeast of the Black Forest where it transitions to the [[Baar (region)|Baar]], at a height of 780 to 950&nbsp;metres above sea level.\n\nThe [[R\u00f6tenbach (Wutach)|R\u00f6tenbach]] flows through the village from north to south and continues through the R\u00f6tenbach Gorge (''R\u00f6tenbachschlucht'') before emptying into the [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Roetenbach kirche.jpg|thumb|upright|The church in R\u00f6tenbach]]\nThe village was first mentioned under the name of ''Rotinbah'' on 19 January 819. The deed was preserved in [[St. Gallen]]. A local nobleman called ''Ruadger'' gave a gift to St Martin's Church in [[L\u00f6ffingen]].\n\nSince 1563 the parish was in the sole ownership of the  [[House of F\u00fcrstenberg (Swabian nobility)|House of F\u00fcrstenberg]].\nPreviously there is evidence of ownership by the following ecclesiastical bodies:\n* The church in L\u00f6ffingen\n* Friedenweiler Abbey\n* Maria Abbey, [[Neudingen]]\n* [[Freiburg Charterhouse]]\n* [[St. Blaise Abbey, Black Forest|St. Blaise Abbey]]\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the [[Principality of F\u00fcrstenberg]], R\u00f6tenbach went in 1806 to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, R\u00f6tenbach was home to a [[cottage industry]], mainly involved in the following activities:\n\nFrom 1770, clock and [[watchmaking]] expanded. For example, since 1782 R\u00f6tenbach families ran a clock business in London. In R\u00f6tenbach clockface painting (''Uhrenschildermalerei'') developed into [[verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9]] (''Hinterglasmalerei''). The  Winterhalder family of artists were particularly famous for this, especially Benedikt Winterhalder, who was born on 20 March 1813.\n\n[[Luthier]]s worked in R\u00f6tenbach, presumably coming to the Black Forest from the [[Duchy of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Italy]]. Famous R\u00f6tenbacher [[violin maker]]s were Franz Straub and Josef Bier.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n=== Transport ===\nThe [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llental Railway]] (from [[Freiburg (Breisgau) Central Station|Freiburg]] via [[Titisee station|Titisee]] to [[Donaueschingen station|Donaueschingen]]) runs through the village.

About 1,400 of the 2,100 inhabitants of Friedenweiler live in R\u00f6tenbach.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:R\u00f6tenbach panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|R\u00f6tenbach (2004)]]\nR\u00f6tenbach lies about 7&nbsp;km east of [[Titisee-Neustadt]] in the southeast of the Black Forest where it transitions to the [[Baar (region)|Baar]], at a height of 780 to 950&nbsp;metres above sea level.\n\nThe [[R\u00f6tenbach (Wutach)|R\u00f6tenbach]] flows through the village from north to south and continues through the R\u00f6tenbach Gorge (''R\u00f6tenbachschlucht'') before emptying into the [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Roetenbach kirche.jpg|thumb|upright|The church in R\u00f6tenbach]]\nThe village was first mentioned under the name of ''Rotinbah'' on 19 January 819. The deed was preserved in [[St. Gallen]]. A local nobleman called ''Ruadger'' gave a gift to St Martin's Church in [[L\u00f6ffingen]].\n\nSince 1563 the parish was in the sole ownership of the  [[House of F\u00fcrstenberg (Swabian nobility)|House of F\u00fcrstenberg]].\nPreviously there is evidence of ownership by the following ecclesiastical bodies:\n* The church in L\u00f6ffingen\n* Friedenweiler Abbey\n* Maria Abbey, [[Neudingen]]\n* [[Freiburg Charterhouse]]\n* [[St. Blaise Abbey, Black Forest|St. Blaise Abbey]]\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the [[Principality of F\u00fcrstenberg]], R\u00f6tenbach went in 1806 to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, R\u00f6tenbach was home to a [[cottage industry]], mainly involved in the following activities:\n\nFrom 1770, clock and [[watchmaking]] expanded. For example, since 1782 R\u00f6tenbach families ran a clock business in London. In R\u00f6tenbach clockface painting (''Uhrenschildermalerei'') developed into [[verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9]] (''Hinterglasmalerei''). The  Winterhalder family of artists were particularly famous for this, especially Benedikt Winterhalder, who was born on 20 March 1813.\n\n[[Luthier]]s worked in R\u00f6tenbach, presumably coming to the Black Forest from the [[Duchy of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Italy]]. Famous R\u00f6tenbacher [[violin maker]]s were Franz Straub and Josef Bier.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n=== Transport ===\nThe [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llental Railway]] (from [[Freiburg (Breisgau) Central Station|Freiburg]] via [[Titisee station|Titisee]] to [[Donaueschingen station|Donaueschingen]]) runs through the village. The section from [[Titisee-Neustadt|Neustadt]] to [[Donaueschingen]] was built from 1898 to 1901.\nIn the vicinity is the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 31|B 31 federal highway]] from Freiburg to [[Lindau]].\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n[[File:R\u00f6tenbach (Baden) Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Rathaus]]\n\n=== Structures ===\nThe [[village hall]] (''Rathaus'') was built in 1867 and serves today as the municipal hall for Friedenweiler.\n\n=== People linked to the village ===\nThe father of Padre [[Rupert Mayer]] from R\u00f6tenbach.
