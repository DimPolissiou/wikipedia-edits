The company opened branches in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1909,{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=3}} [[Weston-super-Mare]] in 1910,{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=7}} [[Cheltenham]] in 1912{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=3}} and [[Gloucester]] in 1913.{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=3}} In 1912 the company also bought the [[Clifton Rocks Railway]],{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=3}} which closed in 1934. After [[World War I]] more branches were opened in [[Swindon]] (1921), [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] (1922){{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=5}} and [[Coleford, Gloucestershire|Coleford]] (1924).{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=6}}\n\nThe company was not satisfied with the performance of the first buses it bought, and in 1908 began the manufacture of its own buses.{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=2}} The company soon began to sell its buses to other operators. For 75 years, [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles|Bristol buses]] were widely used in the United Kingdom, and were also exported to many countries.\n\nThe Bristol scroll logo was adopted from the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] (a company that had been set up by White) to commemorate the building of [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] at the Tramways Brislington Works during World War I.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200206.html \"Fifty Bristol Years...\"] ''Flight'' 1960</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the company acquired control of another Bristol company, [[Greyhound Motors]], which had started the first long distance coach service between Bristol and London in 1925.{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=10}}{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=6}} The company continued to operate its coach services under the Greyhound name until 1972.{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=156}}\n\nIn 1929, the White family sold its controlling interest to the [[Great Western Railway]], but by 1932 the railway sold its interest to the [[Western National|Western National Omnibus Company]], half owned by the GWR and half by the [[Thomas Tilling|Tilling Group]].{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=7}} In 1932, the railway transferred some of its [[GWR road motor services|bus services]] to the company, in the Swindon and Weston-super-Mare areas and the service between Cheltenham and [[Oxford]].{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=7}}\n\nIn 1930, the company sold its taxicab operations, which it had run since 1887, first with horses and from 1910 with motors.{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=7}}\n\nOutside Bristol the company had operated a mostly rural bus network, but in 1936 the company took over the city bus services in Gloucester and later that year took over the two companies operating trams and buses in the city of Bath, including [[Bath Electric Tramways Company]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/23rd-october-1936/59/bristol--offer-to-bath-concerns Bristol Offer to Bath Concerns] ''Commercial Motor'' 23 October 1936 page 59</ref>{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=8}}\n\nIn Bristol, the [[Bristol Corporation|Corporation]] had the power to purchase the Bristol tramways. The option was never exercised, but led in 1937 to the formation of Bristol Joint Services,{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=10}}{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=9}} a joint undertaking between the company and the Corporation which controlled Bristol's city buses (and initially also its trams) until 1978.{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=186}} The difference between the two operations was not generally apparent to the public as the same livery was used, differing only in the fleetname detail. Furthermore, there were regular loans of vehicles between the two organisations, and the fleet was numbered in a common series.\n\nIn 1941, the last of Bristol's trams ceased operation,{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=10}} and from then on the company only operated buses and coaches \u2013 although it kept the Bristol Tramways name for some years.\n\n===Nationalisation===\nAfter [[World War II]], the new [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government took steps to nationalise much of the country's transport industry. As a result, in 1948 the Tilling Group sold its bus interests to the government, and Bristol Tramways became a state-owned company, under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/12th-november-1948/28/tilling-btc-agreements-signed-a-greements-for-the- Tilling-BTC Agreements Signed] ''Commercial Motor'' 12 November 1948 page 28</ref>{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=20}} Its chassis-building operation proved especially useful and, with the nationalisation of [[Eastern Coach Works]] of [[Lowestoft]], enabled complete buses, coaches (and even some lorry tractor-units for British Road Services and two railbuses for [[British Railways]]) to be built solely for the State sector.\n\nThe new regime resulted in some rationalisation of the company's area of operations. Two other companies, [[Red & White Services|Red & White]] and [[Western National]], both also now state-owned, ran buses in the [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] area of Gloucestershire, and those operations were transferred to Bristol Tramways in 1950. The company was also given control of Cheltenham District Traction, originally a Red & White operation, which ran local bus services in Cheltenham. In return, Bristol Tramways gave up its bus operations in the [[Forest of Dean]].{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |pp=36-37}}\n\nThe 1950s were the peak years of the company's operations. It ran over 1,200 buses in an area stretching from [[Hereford]] to [[Salisbury]] and from Oxford to [[Bridgwater]]. From 1950 (when the company acquired the independent [[Dundry]] Pioneer),{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=37}} until 1966 (when the [[Severn Bridge]] opened and Red & White started routes to Bristol), the company had a total monopoly of bus operations in Bristol, Bath, North Somerset and much of Gloucestershire.

After [[World War I]] more branches were opened in [[Swindon]] (1921), [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] (1922){{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=5}} and [[Coleford, Gloucestershire|Coleford]] (1924).{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=6}}\n\nThe company was not satisfied with the performance of the first buses it bought, and in 1908 began the manufacture of its own buses.{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=2}} The company soon began to sell its buses to other operators. For 75 years, [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles|Bristol buses]] were widely used in the United Kingdom, and were also exported to many countries.\n\nThe Bristol scroll logo was adopted from the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] (a company that had been set up by White) to commemorate the building of [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] at the Tramways Brislington Works during World War I.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200206.html \"Fifty Bristol Years...\"] ''Flight'' 1960</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the company acquired control of another Bristol company, [[Greyhound Motors]], which had started the first long distance coach service between Bristol and London in 1925.{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=10}}{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=6}} The company continued to operate its coach services under the Greyhound name until 1972.{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=156}}\n\nIn 1929, the White family sold its controlling interest to the [[Great Western Railway]], but by 1932 the railway sold its interest to the [[Western National|Western National Omnibus Company]], half owned by the GWR and half by the [[Thomas Tilling|Tilling Group]].{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=7}} In 1932, the railway transferred some of its [[GWR road motor services|bus services]] to the company, in the Swindon and Weston-super-Mare areas and the service between Cheltenham and [[Oxford]].{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=7}}\n\nIn 1930, the company sold its taxicab operations, which it had run since 1887, first with horses and from 1910 with motors.{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=7}}\n\nOutside Bristol the company had operated a mostly rural bus network, but in 1936 the company took over the city bus services in Gloucester and later that year took over the two companies operating trams and buses in the city of Bath, including [[Bath Electric Tramways Company]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/23rd-october-1936/59/bristol--offer-to-bath-concerns Bristol Offer to Bath Concerns] ''Commercial Motor'' 23 October 1936 page 59</ref>{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=8}}\n\nIn Bristol, the [[Bristol Corporation|Corporation]] had the power to purchase the Bristol tramways. The option was never exercised, but led in 1937 to the formation of Bristol Joint Services,{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=10}}{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=9}} a joint undertaking between the company and the Corporation which controlled Bristol's city buses (and initially also its trams) until 1978.{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=186}} The difference between the two operations was not generally apparent to the public as the same livery was used, differing only in the fleetname detail. Furthermore, there were regular loans of vehicles between the two organisations, and the fleet was numbered in a common series.\n\nIn 1941, the last of Bristol's trams ceased operation,{{sfn |Hulin |1974 |p=10}} and from then on the company only operated buses and coaches \u2013 although it kept the Bristol Tramways name for some years.\n\n===Nationalisation===\nAfter [[World War II]], the new [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government took steps to nationalise much of the country's transport industry. As a result, in 1948 the Tilling Group sold its bus interests to the government, and Bristol Tramways became a state-owned company, under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/12th-november-1948/28/tilling-btc-agreements-signed-a-greements-for-the- Tilling-BTC Agreements Signed] ''Commercial Motor'' 12 November 1948 page 28</ref>{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=20}} Its chassis-building operation proved especially useful and, with the nationalisation of [[Eastern Coach Works]] of [[Lowestoft]], enabled complete buses, coaches (and even some lorry tractor-units for British Road Services and two railbuses for [[British Railways]]) to be built solely for the State sector.\n\nThe new regime resulted in some rationalisation of the company's area of operations. Two other companies, [[Red & White Services|Red & White]] and [[Western National]], both also now state-owned, ran buses in the [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] area of Gloucestershire, and those operations were transferred to Bristol Tramways in 1950. The company was also given control of Cheltenham District Traction, originally a Red & White operation, which ran local bus services in Cheltenham. In return, Bristol Tramways gave up its bus operations in the [[Forest of Dean]].{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |pp=36-37}}\n\nThe 1950s were the peak years of the company's operations. It ran over 1,200 buses in an area stretching from [[Hereford]] to [[Salisbury]] and from Oxford to [[Bridgwater]]. From 1950 (when the company acquired the independent [[Dundry]] Pioneer),{{sfn |Curtis |Walker |2007 |p=37}} until 1966 (when the [[Severn Bridge]] opened and Red & White started routes to Bristol), the company had a total monopoly of bus operations in Bristol, Bath, North Somerset and much of Gloucestershire.

The Odras are mentioned as one of the peoples that fought in the Mahabharata. [[Pali]] literature calls them Oddakas. [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] also refer to the Oretas who inhabit India's eastern coast. The modern term Odia dates from the 15th century when it was used by the medieval Muslim chroniclers and adopted by the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] kings of Odisha.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Odisha}}\nThe Odias are distinguished by their [[ethnocultural]] customs as well as the use of the Odia language. Odisha's relative isolation and the lack of any discernible outside influence has contributed towards preserving a social and religious structure that has disappeared from most of North India.\n\nThe inhabitants of Odisha were known as [[Odra Kingdom|Odras]], [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkal]] and [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] in [[Mahabharata]]. During 3rd century BCE coastal Odisha was known as Kalinga. According to Mahabharata Kalinga extended from the mouth of [[Ganga]] in north to the mouth of [[Godavari]] in south.\n\nDuring 4th Century, [[Mahapadma Nanda]] conquered Kalinga.\nDuring rule of [[Ashoka]], Kalinga was annexed as part of [[Maurya Empire]]. During 2nd century BCE, [[Kharavela]] emerged as powerful ruler. He defeated several kings in North and South India. \n[[File:Hatigumfa.jpg|thumb|200px|Hathigumpha inscription of King Kh\u0101ravela at Udayagiri Hills]]\nDuring reign of [[Gupta Empire]], [[Samudra Gupta]] conquered Odisha. [[Harshavardhana]] of [[Kannauj]] conquered Odisha in 7th century.  [[Bhauma-Kara dynasty]] ruled Odisha from 8th to 10th century followed by [[Keshari dynasty]]  from 9th to 12th century. Then [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] ruled Odisha from 11th to 15th century AD.    \n[[File:Konark Sun Temple Front view.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right| Narasimhadeva I is known to have built the Konark temple.]]\nOdisha remained an independent regional power till the early 16th century A.D.

Battle worthy leaders like [[Jayi Rajaguru]] (1806) and [[Buxi Jagabandhu]] (1773) along with the Paikas and Kondh tribal conscripts fought gallantly against the British and won for brief time declaring the independence from the British authority. A series of rebellions and uprisings led by numerous brave Odias like Tapang rebellion (1827), Banapur rebellion (1835), Sambalpur uprising (1827\u201362), Ghumsur Kondh uprising (1835), Kondh Rebellion (1846\u201355), Bhuyan uprising (1864), Ranapur Praja Revolt (1937\u201338), etc. followed in Odisha making it a difficult task for the British to maintain absolute authority over Odisha.\n\nWhile under the Maratha rule, major Odia regions were transferred to the rulers of Bengal that resulted in successive extinction of the language over the course of time in vast regions that stretched until today's [[Bardhaman district|Burdawan]] district of West Bengal. The British applied their divide and rule policy and subsequently transferred Odia areas to the neighboring non-Odia administrative divisions that contributed to the extinction of Odia culture and language in the formerly core regions of Odisha or Kalinga.  Following popular movements and rise of consciousness for Odia identity, a major part of the new Odisha state was first carved out from [[Bengal Presidency]] in 1912. Finally Odisha became a separate province and the first officially recognized language-based state of India in 1936 after the amalgamation of the Odia regions from [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar Orissa Province]], [[Madras Presidency]] and [[Chhattisgarh Division]] was successfully executed. 26 Odia [[princely state]]s including [[Seraikela Kharsawan district|Saraikela-Kharswan]] in today's Jharkhand also signed for merger with the newly formed Odisha state while many major Odia speaking areas were left out due to political incompetence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DsXLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&dq|title=Language Policy and Education in India: Documents, contexts and debates|website=books.google.com|access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\nAlthough the total Odia population is unclear, [[2001 Census of India]] puts the population of Odisha at around 36 million. There are smaller Odia communities in the neighbouring states of [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[Chhattisgarh]]. Most Odias in West Bengal live in the districts of [[Midnapore]] and [[Bankura]]. [[Surat]] in Gujarat also has a large Odia population, primarily diamond workers in the southern district of Ganjam. [[Bengaluru]] and [[Hyderabad]] have sizable Odia population due to an IT boom in late 2000s. Some Odias have migrated to [[Bangladesh]] where they are known as [[Bonaz]] community.\n\nWhile most American Odias prior to 1980 came from [[Balasore]], [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], [[Sambalpur]] and [[Cuttack]], increased demand for software engineers and adoption have brought Odias from other areas. Migration to the UK has been recorded since 1935, and continues to this day. Most British Odias have obtained British citizenship.\n\n== Language and literature ==\n{{Main|Odia language}}\nThe name Odia originated from Odra or Udra tribes that inhabited the central coastal belt (Khordha District and Nayagarh District) of modern Odisha.(Source-Odisha\u2019s legendary history: Hill tribes of Orissa (Odisha) \u2013 Wikipedia).\nAround 35-40 million people in Odisha and adjoining areas speak and use [[Odia language]] which is also one of the six classical languages of India and the only regional language in the Indo-Aryanic family to receive classical language status.<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odia-gets-classical-language-status/article5711965.ece</ref> Odia words are found in the 2nd century B.C [[Jaugada]] inscriptions of emperor [[Ashoka]] and 1st century B.C [[Khandagiri]] inscriptions of emperor Kharavela. Known as Odra Bibhasa or as Odra Magadhi Apabrhamsa in ancient times the language has been inscribed throughout the last two millenniums in ancient [[Pali]], [[Prakrit]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] scripts. The Buddhist Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries by Buddhists like Rahula, Saraha, Luipa, etc. The literary traditions of Odia language achieved prominence towards the rule of the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamshi]] and Eastern Dynasty. In the 14th century during the rule of emperor Kapilendra Deva Routray, the poet Sarala Dasa wrote the Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, praising the goddess Durga. Rama-bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in Odia. Major contributions to the Odia language in the Middle Ages were contributed by the Panchasakha, [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Acyutananda]], [[Yasovanta]] and Ananta.\n\nMughalbandi or Kataki Odia, spoken in the [[Cuttack]] Khordha and [[Puri]] districts is generally considered as the standard dialect and is the language of instruction and media. There are eight major forms of Odia spoken across the Odisha and adjoining areas while another thirteen minor forms spoken by tribal and other groups of people. New literary traditions are emerging in the western Odia form of the language which is [[Sambalpuri language|Sambalpuri]] and prominent poets and writers have emerged like [[Haldhar Nag|Haldar Nag]].\n\n== Position of women in Odia society ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThe position of women in the Odia society has been always held with high value. Besides the historical depiction of queens surrounded by female bodyguards on the temple arts, Odia women are accustomed to follow traditional ways along with acceptance of modern culture. Odia culture celebrates female concentric festivals like Raja, Khudrukuni Osa, Sudasa Brata, Kumar Purnima, etc. which is unique in its nature compared to other cultures in India. Remarkable Odia women like [[Sarala Devi]], [[Ramadevi Choudhury|Rama Devi]], [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]],  etc. played a pivotal role in the national and freedom movement of India. [[Nandini Satpathy|Nandini Satapathy]] became the first female chief minister of the state of Odisha in 1973. The new generation of young women in Odisha pursue higher education and are career-oriented in nature.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Arts of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi dance|Odissi]] is one of the oldest classical dances of India. The [[Applique]] work of [[Pipili]] and [[Sambalpuri Saree|Sambalpuri]] sarees are notable. The silver filigree work from Cuttack and Pattachitra of Raghurajpur are some really authentic representation of ancient Indian art and culture.\n\nOdias were the master of swords and had their own form of martial arts, later popularly known as \"[[Paika akhada]]\".\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|Kalinga architecture}}\nThe Odia architecture has a regional architectural tradition that dates back to at least the 6th century from the times of the [[Shailodbhava dynasty]]. From the times of the Somavamshi and the Eastern Ganga dynasty the [[Kalinga architecture]] form achieved prominence with its special style of temple designs which consist of four major sections of a religious structure, namely Mukha Deula, Nata Mandapa, Bhoga Mandapa and Garba Griha (or the inner sanctum). The examples of these marvelous structures are prevalent across the several hundreds of temples build across the state of Odisha mainly in Bhubaneswar which happens to be known as the temple city. [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]], ruins of the [[Konark Sun Temple|Konark Sun]] temple, [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraj]] temple, etc. are the living examples of ancient Kalinga architecture.\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Odisha}}\nSeafood and sweets dominate Odia cuisine. Rice is the staple cereal and is eaten throughout the day.

According to Jainkhetra Samasa, the Jain tirthankar Prasvanth came to Kopatak which is now Kupari of Baleswar district and was the guest of a person called Dhanya. The Kshetra Samasa, says that Parsvnath preached at Tamralipti (now Tamluk in Bengal) of Kalinga. The national religion of ancient Odisha became Jainism during the time of the emperor Karakandu in the 7th Century B.C. The Kalinga Jina asana was established and the idol of Tirthankara Rishabhanatha then also known as the \"Kalinga Jina\"was the national symbol of the kingdom. Emperor Mahmeghvahana Kharavela was also a devout Jain and a religiously tolerant ruler who reclaimed and re-established the Kalinga Jina that was taken away as a victory token by the [[Nanda Empire|Magadhan]] king, [[Mahapadma Nanda]].\n\nBuddhism was also a prevalent religion in the Odisha region until the late Bhaumakar dynasty's rule. Remarkable archaeological findings like at Dhauli, Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri, khandagiri and Puspagiri across the state have unearthed the buried truth about the Buddhist past of Odisha in a large scale. Even today we can see the Buddhist impact on the socio-cultural traditions of the Odia people. Though a majority of Buddhist shrines lay undiscovered and buried, the past of Odia people is rich with descriptions about them in the Buddhist literature. The [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|tooth relic]] of Buddha was first hosted by ancient Odisha as the king Brahmadutta constructed a beautiful shrine in his capital Dantapura (assumed to be Puri) of Kalinga. Successive dynasties in ancient Odisha's Kalinga or Tri Kalinga region were tolerant and secular in their governance over all the existing religions with [[Vedic period|Vedic]] roots. This provided a peaceful and secure environment for all the religious ideologies to flourish in the region for over a time period of three thousand years. The founder of Vajrayana Buddhism, King [[Indrabhuti]] was born in Odisha along with other prominent monks like [[Saraha]], [[Luipa]], Lakshminara and characters of Buddhist mythology like Tapassu and Bahalika were born in Odisha.\n\nHindu sects like [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] are also the oldest ways of Hindu belief systems in Odisha with many royal dynasties dedicating remarkable temples and making them state religion over their time of rule in history. [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraja]], Rajarani, Mausi Maa Temple and other Temples in Bhubaneswar are mostly of Shaivaite sect while prominent temples of goddesses like Samleswari, Tara-Tarini, Mangala, Budhi Thakurani, Tarini, Kichekeswari and Manikeswari, across Odisha are dedicated to the [[Shakti]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] cult.\n\nThe Odia culture is now mostly echoed through the spread of Vaishnavite [[Jagannath]] culture across the world and the deity Jagannath himself is deeply rooted to every household traditions, culture and religious belief of Odia people today. There are historical references of wooden idols of Hindu deities being worshiped as a specific trend of Kalinga region far before the construction of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]] by the king, [[Anantavarman Chodaganga|Choda Ganga Deva]] in 12th century.\n\nLately converted Christians are generally found among the tribal people especially in the interior districts of [[Gajapati district|Gajapati]] and [[Kandhamal]]. Around 2% of the people are [[Odia Muslims|Muslims]], most of them descendants of migrants from [[North India]] and elsewhere. The larger concentration of the minority Muslim population is in the districts of Bhadrak, Kendrapada and Cuttack.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{See also|Folk dance forms of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi music]] dates back as far as the history of the classical Odissi dance goes back. At present, the Odissi music is being lobbied by the intellectual community of the state to be recognized as a classical form of music by the cultural ministry of India. Be side Classical Odissi dance, there are some other prominent cultural and folk dance forms of the Odia people that have followed different parts if evolution over the ages.\n* [[Odissi]]\n* [[Mahari dance|Mahari]]: A predecessor of Odissi dance that was mostly performed by the temple Devadashi community or royal court performers.\n* [[Dhemsa]]: Is a very popular dance format of the tribal area Undivided Koraput districts of Odisha. This generally performed by the Bhartas/Gouda/Parja Community of Koraput & Nabarangapur during the celebration.\n* [[Gotipua]]\nThe folk dance forms have evolved over ages with direct tribal influence over them. They are listed as below.\n* [[Chhau dance|Chhau]]: The Odia Chhau dance is a direct result of its ancient martial traditions which are depicted in dance performances. Though Chhau is basically an Odia art form, it is also performed in West Bengal.  Saraikella Chhau and Mayurbhanj Chhau are the only two Odia variants that have survived over time with its originality.\n* [[Ghumura dance]]:  Is a direct result of the ancient martial traditions of the Odias when Odia Paikas who marched into the battlefield or rested on the beats and tunes of the Ghumura music.\n* [[Dalkhai]] Dance: Though this dance form has evolved from tribal dance forms, it shows a complex mix of the themes taken from various religious texts of Hinduism. It is very a popular folk dance form of western Odisha.\n* Jodi Sankha: It also derives itself from the martial traditions of ancient Odisha and the performers use only the music generated from the two conchs held by each of them.\n* [[Baagh Naach|Baagh Nach]]\nModern Odias have also adopted western dance and forms. Remarkably, the [[Prince Dance Group|Prince dance group]] was declared as the winner of TV reality show \"India's Got Talent\" in the year 2009 and [[Ananya Sritam Nanda]] was declared as the winner of junior Indian Idol in the year 2015.\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nAncient traces of entertainment can be traced to the rock edicts of Emperor Kharavela which speaks about the festive gatherings held by him in the third year of his rule that included shows of singing, dancing and instrumental music. Ancient temple art of the Odias give a strong and silent testimony to the evolution of Odissi classical dance form over the ages. Bargarh district's Dhanujatra which is also believed to be world's largest open air theater performance, Pala and Daskathia, Jatra or Odia Opera, etc. are some of the traditional ways of entertainment for masses that survive to this day. Modern Odia television shows and movies are widely appreciated by a large section of the middle class section of the Odias and the it continues to evolve at a rapid rate with innovative ways of presentation.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{See also|List of people from Odisha}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Subroto Bagchi]]\n* [[Bhikari Bal]]\n* [[Krishna Beura]]\n* [[Dutee Chand]]\n* [[Bibhusita Das]]\n* [[Gopabandhu Das]]\n* [[Madhusudan Das]]\n* [[Manoj Das]]\n* [[Nandita Das]]\n* [[Shaktikanta Das]]\n* [[Anil Dash]]\n* [[Madhu Sudan Kanungo]]\n* [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]\n* [[Lalit Mansingh]]\n* [[Chaturbhuj Meher]]\n* [[Gangadhar Meher]]\n* [[Kailash Chandra Meher]]\n* [[Kunja Bihari Meher]]\n* [[Sadhu Meher]]\n* [[B.

The Odras are mentioned as one of the peoples that fought in the Mahabharata. [[Pali]] literature calls them Oddakas. [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] also refer to the Oretas who inhabit India's eastern coast. The modern term Odia dates from the 15th century when it was used by the medieval Muslim chroniclers and adopted by the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] kings of Odisha.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Odisha}}\nThe Odias are distinguished by their [[ethnocultural]] customs as well as the use of the Odia language. Odisha's relative isolation and the lack of any discernible outside influence has contributed towards preserving a social and religious structure that has disappeared from most of North India.\n\nThe inhabitants of Odisha were known as [[Odra Kingdom|Odras]], [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkal]] and [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] in [[Mahabharata]]. During 3rd century BCE coastal Odisha was known as Kalinga. According to Mahabharata Kalinga extended from the mouth of [[Ganga]] in north to the mouth of [[Godavari]] in south.\n\nDuring 4th Century, [[Mahapadma Nanda]] conquered Kalinga.\nDuring rule of [[Ashoka]], Kalinga was annexed as part of [[Maurya Empire]]. During 2nd century BCE, [[Kharavela]] emerged as powerful ruler. He defeated several kings in North and South India. \n[[File:Hatigumfa.jpg|thumb|200px|Hathigumpha inscription of King Kh\u0101ravela at Udayagiri Hills]]\nDuring reign of [[Gupta Empire]], [[Samudra Gupta]] conquered Odisha. [[Harshavardhana]] of [[Kannauj]] conquered Odisha in 7th century.  [[Bhauma-Kara dynasty]] ruled Odisha from 8th to 10th century followed by [[Keshari dynasty]]  from 9th to 12th century. Then [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] ruled Odisha from 11th to 15th century AD.    \n[[File:Konark Sun Temple Front view.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right| Narasimhadeva I is known to have built the Konark temple.]]\nOdisha remained an independent regional power till the early 16th century A.D. It was conquered by the [[Mughals]] under [[Akbar]] in 1568 and was thereafter subject to a succession of Mughal and [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] rule before finally falling to the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the year 1803.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/book-by-british-ics-officer-covers----orissa--as-a-whole.html|title=Book by British ICS officer covers \u2018Orissa' as a whole|website=dailypioneer|author=GYANENENDRA NATH MITRA|date=25 December 2019|access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nHard impositions of taxes by the British, administrative malpractices by the pro British Bengali landlords or officials and stripping the rights of local people along with suppression of native landlords in Odisha led to India's first<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/paika-bidroha-to-be-named-as-1st-war-of-independence/article19909264.ece</ref> reorganized revolt against the British in the year 1817 popularly known as [[Paik Rebellion|Paika Bidroh]] or rebellion. Battle worthy leaders like [[Jayi Rajaguru]] (1806) and [[Buxi Jagabandhu]] (1773) along with the Paikas and Kondh tribal conscripts fought gallantly against the British and won for brief time declaring the independence from the British authority. A series of rebellions and uprisings led by numerous brave Odias like Tapang rebellion (1827), Banapur rebellion (1835), Sambalpur uprising (1827\u201362), Ghumsur Kondh uprising (1835), Kondh Rebellion (1846\u201355), Bhuyan uprising (1864), Ranapur Praja Revolt (1937\u201338), etc. followed in Odisha making it a difficult task for the British to maintain absolute authority over Odisha.\n\nWhile under the Maratha rule, major Odia regions were transferred to the rulers of Bengal that resulted in successive extinction of the language over the course of time in vast regions that stretched until today's [[Bardhaman district|Burdawan]] district of West Bengal. The British applied their divide and rule policy and subsequently transferred Odia areas to the neighboring non-Odia administrative divisions that contributed to the extinction of Odia culture and language in the formerly core regions of Odisha or Kalinga.  Following popular movements and rise of consciousness for Odia identity, a major part of the new Odisha state was first carved out from [[Bengal Presidency]] in 1912. Finally Odisha became a separate province and the first officially recognized language-based state of India in 1936 after the amalgamation of the Odia regions from [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar Orissa Province]], [[Madras Presidency]] and [[Chhattisgarh Division]] was successfully executed. 26 Odia [[princely state]]s including [[Seraikela Kharsawan district|Saraikela-Kharswan]] in today's Jharkhand also signed for merger with the newly formed Odisha state while many major Odia speaking areas were left out due to political incompetence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DsXLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&dq|title=Language Policy and Education in India: Documents, contexts and debates|website=books.google.com|access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\nAlthough the total Odia population is unclear, [[2001 Census of India]] puts the population of Odisha at around 36 million. There are smaller Odia communities in the neighbouring states of [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[Chhattisgarh]]. Most Odias in West Bengal live in the districts of [[Midnapore]] and [[Bankura]]. [[Surat]] in Gujarat also has a large Odia population, primarily diamond workers in the southern district of Ganjam. [[Bengaluru]] and [[Hyderabad]] have sizable Odia population due to an IT boom in late 2000s. Some Odias have migrated to [[Bangladesh]] where they are known as [[Bonaz]] community.\n\nWhile most American Odias prior to 1980 came from [[Balasore]], [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], [[Sambalpur]] and [[Cuttack]], increased demand for software engineers and adoption have brought Odias from other areas. Migration to the UK has been recorded since 1935, and continues to this day. Most British Odias have obtained British citizenship.\n\n== Language and literature ==\n{{Main|Odia language}}\nAround 35-40 million people in Odisha and adjoining areas speak and use [[Odia language]] which is also one of the six classical languages of India and the only regional language in the Indo-Aryanic family to receive classical language status.<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odia-gets-classical-language-status/article5711965.ece</ref> Odia words are found in the 2nd century B.C [[Jaugada]] inscriptions of emperor [[Ashoka]] and 1st century B.C [[Khandagiri]] inscriptions of emperor Kharavela. Known as Odra Bibhasa or as Odra Magadhi Apabrhamsa in ancient times the language has been inscribed throughout the last two millenniums in ancient [[Pali]], [[Prakrit]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] scripts. The Buddhist Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries by Buddhists like Rahula, Saraha, Luipa, etc. The literary traditions of Odia language achieved prominence towards the rule of the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamshi]] and Eastern Dynasty. In the 14th century during the rule of emperor Kapilendra Deva Routray, the poet Sarala Dasa wrote the Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, praising the goddess Durga. Rama-bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in Odia. Major contributions to the Odia language in the Middle Ages were contributed by the Panchasakha, [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Acyutananda]], [[Yasovanta]] and Ananta.\n\nMughalbandi or Kataki Odia, spoken in the [[Cuttack]] Khordha and [[Puri]] districts is generally considered as the standard dialect and is the language of instruction and media. There are eight major forms of Odia spoken across the Odisha and adjoining areas while another thirteen minor forms spoken by tribal and other groups of people. New literary traditions are emerging in the western Odia form of the language which is [[Sambalpuri language|Sambalpuri]] and prominent poets and writers have emerged like [[Haldhar Nag|Haldar Nag]].\n\n== Position of women in Odia society ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThe position of women in the Odia society has been always held with high value. Besides the historical depiction of queens surrounded by female bodyguards on the temple arts, Odia women are accustomed to follow traditional ways along with acceptance of modern culture. Odia culture celebrates female concentric festivals like Raja, Khudrukuni Osa, Sudasa Brata, Kumar Purnima, etc. which is unique in its nature compared to other cultures in India. Remarkable Odia women like [[Sarala Devi]], [[Ramadevi Choudhury|Rama Devi]], [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]],  etc. played a pivotal role in the national and freedom movement of India. [[Nandini Satpathy|Nandini Satapathy]] became the first female chief minister of the state of Odisha in 1973. The new generation of young women in Odisha pursue higher education and are career-oriented in nature.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Arts of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi dance|Odissi]] is one of the oldest classical dances of India. The [[Applique]] work of [[Pipili]] and [[Sambalpuri Saree|Sambalpuri]] sarees are notable. The silver filigree work from Cuttack and Pattachitra of Raghurajpur are some really authentic representation of ancient Indian art and culture.\n\nOdias were the master of swords and had their own form of martial arts, later popularly known as \"[[Paika akhada]]\".\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|Kalinga architecture}}\nThe Odia architecture has a regional architectural tradition that dates back to at least the 6th century from the times of the [[Shailodbhava dynasty]]. From the times of the Somavamshi and the Eastern Ganga dynasty the [[Kalinga architecture]] form achieved prominence with its special style of temple designs which consist of four major sections of a religious structure, namely Mukha Deula, Nata Mandapa, Bhoga Mandapa and Garba Griha (or the inner sanctum). The examples of these marvelous structures are prevalent across the several hundreds of temples build across the state of Odisha mainly in Bhubaneswar which happens to be known as the temple city. [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]], ruins of the [[Konark Sun Temple|Konark Sun]] temple, [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraj]] temple, etc. are the living examples of ancient Kalinga architecture.\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Odisha}}\nSeafood and sweets dominate Odia cuisine.

Though a majority of Buddhist shrines lay undiscovered and buried, the past of Odia people is rich with descriptions about them in the Buddhist literature. The [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|tooth relic]] of Buddha was first hosted by ancient Odisha as the king Brahmadutta constructed a beautiful shrine in his capital Dantapura (assumed to be Puri) of Kalinga. Successive dynasties in ancient Odisha's Kalinga or Tri Kalinga region were tolerant and secular in their governance over all the existing religions with [[Vedic period|Vedic]] roots. This provided a peaceful and secure environment for all the religious ideologies to flourish in the region for over a time period of three thousand years. The founder of Vajrayana Buddhism, King [[Indrabhuti]] was born in Odisha along with other prominent monks like [[Saraha]], [[Luipa]], Lakshminara and characters of Buddhist mythology like Tapassu and Bahalika were born in Odisha.\n\nHindu sects like [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] are also the oldest ways of Hindu belief systems in Odisha with many royal dynasties dedicating remarkable temples and making them state religion over their time of rule in history. [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraja]], Rajarani, Mausi Maa Temple and other Temples in Bhubaneswar are mostly of Shaivaite sect while prominent temples of goddesses like Samleswari, Tara-Tarini, Mangala, Budhi Thakurani, Tarini, Kichekeswari and Manikeswari, across Odisha are dedicated to the [[Shakti]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] cult.\n\nThe Odia culture is now mostly echoed through the spread of Vaishnavite [[Jagannath]] culture across the world and the deity Jagannath himself is deeply rooted to every household traditions, culture and religious belief of Odia people today. There are historical references of wooden idols of Hindu deities being worshiped as a specific trend of Kalinga region far before the construction of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]] by the king, [[Anantavarman Chodaganga|Choda Ganga Deva]] in 12th century.\n\nLately converted Christians are generally found among the tribal people especially in the interior districts of [[Gajapati district|Gajapati]] and [[Kandhamal]]. Around 2% of the people are [[Odia Muslims|Muslims]], most of them descendants of migrants from [[North India]] and elsewhere. The larger concentration of the minority Muslim population is in the districts of Bhadrak, Kendrapada and Cuttack.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{See also|Folk dance forms of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi music]] dates back as far as the history of the classical Odissi dance goes back. At present, the Odissi music is being lobbied by the intellectual community of the state to be recognized as a classical form of music by the cultural ministry of India. Be side Classical Odissi dance, there are some other prominent cultural and folk dance forms of the Odia people that have followed different parts if evolution over the ages.\n* [[Odissi]]\n* [[Mahari dance|Mahari]]: A predecessor of Odissi dance that was mostly performed by the temple Devadashi community or royal court performers.\n* [[Dhemsa]]: Is a very popular dance format of the tribal area Undivided Koraput districts of Odisha. This generally performed by the Bhartas/Gouda/Parja Community of Koraput & Nabarangapur during the celebration.\n* [[Gotipua]]\nThe folk dance forms have evolved over ages with direct tribal influence over them. They are listed as below.\n* [[Chhau dance|Chhau]]: The Odia Chhau dance is a direct result of its ancient martial traditions which are depicted in dance performances. Though Chhau is basically an Odia art form, it is also performed in West Bengal.  Saraikella Chhau and Mayurbhanj Chhau are the only two Odia variants that have survived over time with its originality.\n* [[Ghumura dance]]:  Is a direct result of the ancient martial traditions of the Odias when Odia Paikas who marched into the battlefield or rested on the beats and tunes of the Ghumura music.\n* [[Dalkhai]] Dance: Though this dance form has evolved from tribal dance forms, it shows a complex mix of the themes taken from various religious texts of Hinduism. It is very a popular folk dance form of western Odisha.\n* Jodi Sankha: It also derives itself from the martial traditions of ancient Odisha and the performers use only the music generated from the two conchs held by each of them.\n* [[Baagh Naach|Baagh Nach]]\nModern Odias have also adopted western dance and forms. Remarkably, the [[Prince Dance Group|Prince dance group]] was declared as the winner of TV reality show \"India's Got Talent\" in the year 2009 and [[Ananya Sritam Nanda]] was declared as the winner of junior Indian Idol in the year 2015.\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nAncient traces of entertainment can be traced to the rock edicts of Emperor Kharavela which speaks about the festive gatherings held by him in the third year of his rule that included shows of singing, dancing and instrumental music. Ancient temple art of the Odias give a strong and silent testimony to the evolution of Odissi classical dance form over the ages. Bargarh district's Dhanujatra which is also believed to be world's largest open air theater performance, Pala and Daskathia, Jatra or Odia Opera, etc. are some of the traditional ways of entertainment for masses that survive to this day. Modern Odia television shows and movies are widely appreciated by a large section of the middle class section of the Odias and the it continues to evolve at a rapid rate with innovative ways of presentation.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{See also|List of people from Odisha}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Subroto Bagchi]]\n* [[Bhikari Bal]]\n* [[Krishna Beura]]\n* [[Dutee Chand]]\n* [[Bibhusita Das]]\n* [[Gopabandhu Das]]\n* [[Madhusudan Das]]\n* [[Manoj Das]]\n* [[Nandita Das]]\n* [[Shaktikanta Das]]\n* [[Anil Dash]]\n* [[Madhu Sudan Kanungo]]\n* [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]\n* [[Lalit Mansingh]]\n* [[Chaturbhuj Meher]]\n* [[Gangadhar Meher]]\n* [[Kailash Chandra Meher]]\n* [[Kunja Bihari Meher]]\n* [[Sadhu Meher]]\n* [[B.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal.
