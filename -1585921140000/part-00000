On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived [[Banat Republic]]. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918\u20131919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Centre, and the [[interwar]] years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-revisionist]] demonstrations also took place during this time.\n\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\n\nAfter the war, the [[People's Republic of Romania]] was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietization and later, [[Systematization]]. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture.<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/industria-timisoarei-inflorirea-imperiul-austro-ungar-intreprinderile-comuniste-smecheriile-democratia-originala-1_535f5d910d133766a830736b/index.html Industria Timi\u015foarei] {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref>[https://www.banatulazi.ro/fabricile-celebre-ale-timisoarei-din-comunism-facute-una-cu-pamantul-in-capitalism/ Fabricile celebre ale Timi\u0219oarei din comunism] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KP7BQ3oXXgC|title=Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment|last=Kotkin|first=Stephen|publisher=Modern Library|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8129-6679-4|location=|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 decembrie 1989: Timi\u0219oara, primul ora\u015f liber de comunism|url = http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Timisoara/Stiri/20+decembrie+1989+Timisoara+primul+oras+liber|website = www.digi24.ro|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bega Canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bega Canal]]]]\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} on the southeast edge of the [[Banat]] plain, part of the [[Pannonian Plain]] near the divergence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], but on the [[Bega Canal]]. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only {{convert|0.5|to(-)|5|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings. The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Romania}}\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.\n\nFrom September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.\n\nFreak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until first of November.

On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived [[Banat Republic]]. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918\u20131919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Centre, and the [[interwar]] years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-revisionist]] demonstrations also took place during this time.\n\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\n\nAfter the war, the [[People's Republic of Romania]] was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietization and later, [[Systematization]]. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture.<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/industria-timisoarei-inflorirea-imperiul-austro-ungar-intreprinderile-comuniste-smecheriile-democratia-originala-1_535f5d910d133766a830736b/index.html Industria Timi\u015foarei] {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref>[https://www.banatulazi.ro/fabricile-celebre-ale-timisoarei-din-comunism-facute-una-cu-pamantul-in-capitalism/ Fabricile celebre ale Timi\u0219oarei din comunism] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KP7BQ3oXXgC|title=Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment|last=Kotkin|first=Stephen|publisher=Modern Library|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8129-6679-4|location=|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 decembrie 1989: Timi\u0219oara, primul ora\u015f liber de comunism|url = http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Timisoara/Stiri/20+decembrie+1989+Timisoara+primul+oras+liber|website = www.digi24.ro|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bega Canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bega Canal]]]]\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} on the southeast edge of the [[Banat]] plain, part of the [[Pannonian Plain]] near the divergence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], but on the [[Bega Canal]]. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only {{convert|0.5|to(-)|5|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings.

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.\n\nFrom September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.\n\nFreak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until first of November. The median date for the first freeze is 22 October, while that of the last freeze is 15 April. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data, [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]\n|1787 | 9479\n|1847 | 18103\n|1869 | 32725\n|1880 | 33694\n|1890 | 39884\n|1900 | 53033\n|1910 | 72555\n|1920 | 82689\n|1930 | 91580\n|1941 | 110840\n|1948 | 111987\n|1956 | 142257\n|1966 | 174243\n|1977 | 269353\n|1992 | 334115\n|2002 | 317660\n|2011 | 319279\n|2016 | 332983\n}}\n\n[[File:Festivalul Florilor TimFloralis.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The historic centre of Timi\u0219oara, with the [[Timi\u0219oara Orthodox Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Timi\u0219oara has a population of 319,279.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/> As defined by INS, the Timi\u0219oara [[functional urban area]] has a population of 468,162.<ref name=\"world_bank\">{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448771499322731333/pdf/116400-ROMANIAN-REVISED-PUBLIC-Magnet-Cities-Migration-and-Commuting-in-Romania-RO.|title=Error}}</ref>\n\nOf this population, 86.79% were ethnic [[Romanians]], while 5.12% were [[Hungarians]], 1.37% [[Ethnic German|Germans]], 1.3% [[Serbs]], 0.69% [[Romani people|Romani]], 0.18% [[Ukrainians]], 0.17% [[Slovaks]], 0.11% [[Jews]] and 0.76% others.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1832&judet_id=2057&localitate_id=2058 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> 14.2% of the population are under 15 years of age, 4.0% are over 75.\n\nSince 1990, Timi\u0219oara saw a slight population decline owing to [[Human migration|migration]] and a drop in birthrates.

Whaling has been an important subsistence and economic activity in multiple regions throughout human history. Commercial whaling dramatically reduced in importance during the 19th century due to the development of alternatives to whale oil for lighting, and the collapse in whale populations. Nevertheless, some nations continue to hunt whales even today.\n\n== Early history ==\n[[File:Sombrero de jefe de balleneros Nutka (M.

Once the missile had been shot into a whale's body, the buoyancy and drag from the drogue would eventually cause the whale to tire, allowing it to be approached and killed.

Whale Chart-1851]]\nBeginning in the late colonial period, the United States grew to become the preeminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. American whaling's origins were in New York and New England, including [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts and nearby cities. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 18th century whaling in [[Nantucket]] had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and traveling as far as South Pacific waters. During the [[American Revolution]], the British navy targeted American whaling ships as legitimate prizes. In turn, many whalers fitted out as privateers against the British.\n\nWhaling recovered after the war ended in 1783 and the industry began to prosper, using bases at Nantucket and then [[New Bedford]]. Whalers took greater economic risks in search of profit, expanding their hunting grounds. Investment and financing arrangements allowed managers of whaling ventures to share their risks by selling some equity, but retain a substantial portion of the profit. As a result, they had little incentive to plan their voyages to minimize risk.<ref>Eric Hilt, \"Investment and Diversification in the American Whaling Industry.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 2007 67(2): 292\u2013314. {{ISSN|0022-0507}}</ref>\n\nTen thousand seamen manned the ships, including more than 3,000 African American seamen.<ref>David Moment, \"The Business of Whaling in America in the 1850s,\" ''Business History Review,'' Fall 1957, 31#3 pp 261-291</ref> Early whaling efforts concentrated on right whales and humpbacks, which were found near the American coast. As these populations declined and the market for whale products grew, American whalers began hunting sperm whales. The sperm whale was particularly prized for [[spermaceti]], a dense waxy substance that burns with an exceedingly bright flame that is found in the [[spermaceti organ]], located forward and above the skull. Hunting sperm whales required longer whaling voyages.\n\nWhale oil was essential for illuminating homes and businesses in the 19th century, and lubricated the machines of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Baleen]] (the long [[keratin]] strips that hang from the top of whales' mouths) was used by manufacturers in the United States and Europe to make varied consumer goods.\n\nBritish competition and import duties drove New England whaling ships out of the North Atlantic and into the southern oceans, ultimately making whaling into a global economic enterprise. The mid 19th century was the golden age of American whaling.\n\nFrom the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when Confederate raiders targeted American whalers, through the early 20th century, the American whaling industry suffered economic competition, especially from [[kerosene]], a superior fuel for lighting.<ref>Dolin (2007)</ref>\n\n===== Localities =====\n[[File:Der Wal und seine Produkte 01.jpg|thumb|\"The whale and its products\", {{circa|1900}}]]\nA number of New England towns were heavily involved in whaling, particularly [[Nantucket]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. Nantucket began whaling in 1690 after recruiting a whaling instructor, Ichabod Paddock.<ref>Starbuck (1878), p.17.</ref> The south side of the island was divided into three and a half mile sections, each with a mast erected to look for the spouts of right whales. Once a whale was sighted, rowing boats were sent from the shore. If the whale was successfully killed it was towed ashore, [[Flensing|flensed]] (i.e., the [[blubber]] was cut off), and the blubber boiled in cauldrons known as \"[[try pot]]s\". Even when whales were caught far offshore, the blubber was still boiled on shore well into the 18th century. New Bedford whaling was established when prominent Nantucket whaling families moved their operations to the town for economic reasons, and made New Bedford the fourth busiest port in the United States. In [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''<ref>Melville's ''Moby-Dick''</ref> the narrator begins his whaling voyage from New Bedford.\n\nIn the late 1870s, schooners began hunting humpbacks in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. In 1880, with the decline of [[Menhaden#Relation to humans|menhaden fish]], steamers began to switch to hunting fin and [[humpback whales]] using bomb lances. This has been called \"shoot-and-salvage\" because of the high-rate of loss due to whales sinking, lines breaking, etc. The first such whale hunting ship was the steamer ''Mabel Bird'', which towed whale carcasses to an oil processing plant in [[Boothbay Harbor]]. At its height in 1885 four or five steamers were engaged in whale fishery at Boothbay Harbour, dwindling to one by the end of the decade. Over 100 whales were killed annually during some years. The fishery ended in the late 1890s.\n\n===== Technological advancement  =====\nIn the 1850s, the Euro\u2013American whalemen began a serious attempt at catching [[rorqual]]s such as the [[blue whale]] and [[fin whale]].  In the 1860s Captain [[Thomas Welcome Roys]] invented a rocket harpoon, making a significant contribution to the development of the California whaling industry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sharpe|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Winter|first2=Frank H.|date=1971-12-01|title=The California Whaling Rocket and the Men behind It|journal=California Historical Quarterly|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.2307/25157350|issn=0097-6059|jstor=25157350}}</ref> In 1877, John Nelson Fletcher, a pyrotechnist, and a former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldier, Robert L. Suits, modified Roys's rocket, marketing it as the \"California Whaling Rocket\". The rocket was highly effective in killing whales.<ref>Schmitt et al (1980), pp. 182\u2013185.</ref><ref>Schmitt et al (1980), p. 186.</ref>\n\nDanish naval officer Captain Otto C. Hammer and the Dutchman Captain C. J. Bottemanne also imitated Roys' rocket harpoon. Hammer formed the Danish Fishing Company, which operated from 1865 to 1871.  Botteman formed the Netherlands Whaling Company, which operated from 1869 to 1872.\n\n===== Legacy =====\nIn 1996, the New Bedford Whaling National Historic Site was established, offering exhibits on the history of the \"City that Lit the World\".<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nebe New Bedford Whaling National Historic Site]</ref>\n\n==== Pacific Northwest ====\n{{Main|Whaling on the Pacific Northwest Coast}}\nWhaling on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast encompassed both [[aboriginal whaling|aboriginal]] and commercial whaling.

For other groups, especially the [[Haida people|Haida]], whales appear prominently as totems.\n\nHunting of cetaceans continues by [[Alaska Natives]] (mainly [[beluga whale|beluga]] and [[narwhal]], plus [[subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale]]) and to a lesser extent by the Makah ([[gray whale]]). Commercial whaling in British Columbia and southeast Alaska ended in the late 1960s.\n\n=== Basque Country ===\n{{Main|History of Basque whaling}}\nThe first mention of [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] whaling was made in 1059,<ref name=\"Ellis 1991, p.45\">Ellis (1991), p.45.</ref> when it was said to have been practiced at the Basque town of [[Bayonne]]. The fishery spread to what is now the Spanish Basque Country in 1150, when King [[Sancho the Wise]] of [[Navarre]] granted petitions for the warehousing of such commodities as whalebone (baleen).<ref name=\"Ellis 1991, p.45\"/> At first, they hunted the [[North Atlantic right whale]], using watchtowers (known as vigias) to look for their distinctive twin vapor spouts.\n\nBy the 14th century, Basque whalers were making \"seasonal trips\" to the [[English Channel]] and southern [[Ireland]]. The fishery spread to Terranova ([[Labrador]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]) in the second quarter of the 16th century,<ref>Barkham (1984), p. 515.</ref> and to [[Iceland]] by the early 17th century.<ref>Rafnsson (2006), p. 4.</ref> They established whaling stations in Terranova, mainly in [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]],<ref>Between 1550 and the early 17th century, Red Bay, known as Balea Baya (Whale Bay), was a centre for Basque whaling operations.</ref> and hunted bowheads as well as right whales.\n\nThe fishery in Terranova declined for a variety of reasons, including the conflicts between Spain and other European powers during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, attacks by hostile [[Inuit]], declining whale populations, and perhaps the opening up of the [[Spitsbergen]] fishery in 1611.\n\nThe first voyages to Spitsbergen by the English, Dutch, and Danish relied on Basque specialists, with the Basque provinces sending out their own whaler in 1612. The following season [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] and [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] sent out a combined eleven or twelve whalers to the Spitsbergen fishery, but most were driven off by the Dutch and English.<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 7\u20138.</ref><ref name=\"Markham 1881 pp. 11\">See the accounts of the 1613 season by [[William Baffin|Baffin]] (pp. 38\u201353) and [[Robert Fotherby|Fotherby]] (pp. 54\u201368) in Markham (1881) and [[Hessel Gerritsz|Gerrits]] (pp. 11\u201338) in Conway (1904).</ref>  Two more ships were sent by a merchant in San Sebasti\u00e1n in 1615, but both were driven away by the Dutch. Conflict over the Spitsbergen whaling grounds between the English, French, Dutch and Danish continued until 1638.\n\nWhale fishing in Iceland and Spitsbergen continued at least into the 18th century, but Basque whaling in those regions appears to have ended in 1756 at the beginning of the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>Du Pasquier (1984), p. 538.</ref>\n\n===Greenland and Spitsbergen===\n[[File:Abraham Storck - Walvisvangst.jpg|thumb|''Whaling'', by [[Abraham Storck]]]]\n[[File:Whaling-dangers of the whale fishery.jpeg|thumb|''Dangers of the Whale Fishery'', by W. Scoresby, 1820]]\n[[File:Walvisvangst bij de kust van Spitsbergen - Dutch whalers near Spitsbergen (Abraham Storck, 1690).jpg|thumb|''Whaling off the Coast of Spitsbergen'', by Abraham Storck]]\n\nEncouraged by reports of whales off the coast of [[Spitsbergen]], Norway, in 1610, the English [[Muscovy Company]] (also known as the Russian Company) sent a whaling expedition there the following year. The expedition was a disaster, with both ships sent being lost. The crews returned to England in a ship from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].<ref>See the accounts by [[Thomas Edge|Edge]] (pp. 12-15) and [[Jonas Poole|Poole]] (pp. 34\u201340) in Purchas (1625).</ref> The following year two more ships were sent. Other countries followed suit, with Amsterdam and [[Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] each sending a ship north. The latter ship returned to Spain with a full cargo of oil. Such a fabulous return resulted in a fleet of whaleships being sent to Spitsbergen in 1613. The Muscovy Company sent seven, backed by a monopoly charter granted by [[James I of England|King James I]]. They met with twenty other whaleships (eleven or twelve Basque, five French, and three Dutch), as well as a London interloper, which were either ordered away or forced to pay a fine of some sort.<ref name=\"Markham 1881 pp. 11\"/> The [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], France, and Spain all protested against this treatment, but James I held fast to his claim of sovereignty over Spitsbergen.\n \t\nThe following three and a half decades witnessed numerous clashes between the various nations (as well as infighting among the English), often merely posturing, but sometimes resulting in bloodshed. This jealousy stemmed as much from the mechanics of early whaling as from straightforward international animosities. In the first years of the fishery England, France, the United Provinces and later Denmark\u2013Norway shipped expert Basque whalemen for their expeditions. At the time Basque whaling relied on the utilization of stations ashore where blubber could be processed into oil. In order to allow a rapid transference of this technique to Spitsbergen, suitable anchorages had to be selected, of which there were only a limited number, in particular on the west coast of the island.<ref>Jackson (1978), p. 12.</ref>\n \t\nEarly in 1614, the Dutch formed the ''[[Noordsche Compagnie]]'' (Northern Company), a cartel composed of several independent chambers (each representing a particular port). The company sent fourteen ships supported by three or four men-of-war this year, while the English sent a fleet of thirteen ships and pinnaces. Equally matched, they agreed to split the coast between themselves, to the exclusion of third parties. The English received the four principal harbors in the middle of the west coast, while the Dutch could settle anywhere to the south or north. The agreement explicitly stated that it was only meant to last for this season.<ref>Purchas (1625), pp. 16\u201317; Conway (1906), pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n \t\nIn 1615 the Dutch arrived with a fleet of eleven ships and three men-of-war under [[Adriaen Block]], occupied [[Fairhaven, Svalbard|Fairhaven]], [[Bellsund|Bell Sound]], and [[Hornsund|Horn Sound]] by force, and built the first permanent structure on Spitsbergen: a wooden hut to store their equipment in. The ten ships sent by the Muscovy Company were relegated to the south side of Fairhaven, [[Forlandsundet|Sir Thomas Smith's Bay]], and [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Ice Sound]].<ref>Purchas (1625), p. 17; Conway (1906), p. 84.</ref> The Danes meanwhile sent a fleet of five sail under [[Gabriel Kruse]] to demand a toll from the foreign whalers and in doing so assert [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV's]] claim of sovereignty over the region, but both the English and Dutch rebuffed his efforts\u2014two ships from Bordeaux chartered by a merchant in San Sebastian were also sent away by the Dutch.<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), pp. 46\u201348.</ref> The following year, 1616, the English, with a fleet of ten ships, occupied all the major harbors, appropriated the Dutch hut, and made a rich haul, while the Dutch, preoccupied with [[Jan Mayen]], only sent four ships to Spitsbergen, which \"kept together in odd places... and made a poor voyage.\"<ref>Purchas (1625), p. 18; Conway (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n \nIn 1617 a ship from [[Vlissingen]] whaling in Horn Sound had its cargo seized by the English vice-admiral.<ref>Conway (1906), pp. 95\u2013101.</ref> Angry, the following season the Dutch sent nearly two dozen ships to Spitsbergen.

The Danish\u2013Dutch settlement came to be called [[Smeerenburg]], which would become the centre of operations for the latter in the first decades of the fishery. Numerous place names attest to the various nations' presence, including Copenhagen Bay (''[[Kobbefjorden]]'') and [[Danes Island]] (''Dansk\u00f8ya''), where the Danes established a station from 1631\u20131658; Port Louis or Refuge Fran\u00e7ais (''[[Hamburgbukta]]''), where the French had a station from 1633\u20131638, until they were driven away by the Danes (see below); and finally English Bay (''[[Engelskbukta]]''), as well as the number of features named by English whalemen and explorers\u2014for example, Isfjorden, Bellsund, and Hornsund, to name a few.\n \t\nHostilities continued after 1619. In 1626 nine ships from Hull and York destroyed the Muscovy Company's fort and station in Bell Sound, and sailed to their own in Midterhukhamna.<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 174\u2013175.</ref> Here they were found by the heavily armed flagship of the London whaling fleet; a two-hour battle ensued, resulting in defeat for the Hull and York fleet and their expulsion from Spitsbergen.<ref>Appleby (2008), pp. 39\u201341.</ref> In 1630 both the ships of Hull and [[Great Yarmouth]], who had recently joined the trade, were driven away clean (empty) by the ships from London. From 1631 to 1633, the Danes, French, and Dutch quarreled with each other, resulting in the expulsion of the Danes from Smeerenburg and the French from Copenhagen Bay. In 1634 the Dutch burned down one of the Danes' huts.<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), p. 190.</ref> There were also two battles this season, one between the English and French (the latter won)<ref>Henrat (1984), p. 545.</ref> and the other between London and Yarmouth (the latter won, as well).<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 176\u2013179.</ref> In 1637<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> and again in 1638 the Danes drove the French out of Port Louis and seized their cargoes. In the former year they also seized a French ship in the open sea and detained it in Copenhagen Bay,<ref>Du Pasquier (2000), p. 83, 323.</ref> while in the latter year they also held two Dutch ships captive in the same bay for over a month, which led to protests from the Dutch.<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), pp. 214\u2013215.</ref> Following the events of 1638 hostilities, for the most part, ceased, with the exception of a few minor incidents in the 1640s between the French and Danes, as well as between Copenhagen and Hamburg and London and Yarmouth, respectively.\n \t\nThe species hunted was the [[bowhead whale]], a baleen whale that yielded large quantities of oil and baleen. The whales entered the fjords in the spring following the breakup of the ice. They were spotted by the whalemen from suitable vantage points, and pursued by ''shallops'', ''chaloupes'' or ''chalupas'', which were manned by six men. (These terms derive from the Basque word \"txalupa\", used to name the whaling boats that were widely utilized during the golden era of Basque whaling in Labrador in the 16th century.) The whale was harpooned and lanced to death and either towed to the stern of the ship or to the shore at low tide, where men with long knives would flense (cut up) the blubber. The blubber was boiled in large copper kettles and cooled in large wooden vessels, after which it was funneled into casks. The stations at first only consisted of tents of sail and crude furnaces, but were soon replaced by more permanent structures of wood and brick, such as Smeerenburg for the Dutch, [[L\u00e6gerneset]] for the English, and Copenhagen Bay for the Danes.\n \t\t \t\nBeginning in the 1630s, for the Dutch at least, whaling expanded into the open sea. Gradually whaling in the open sea and along the ice floes to the west of Spitsbergen replaced bay whaling. At first, the blubber was tried out at the end of the season at Smeerenburg or elsewhere along the coast, but after mid-century the stations were abandoned entirely in favor of processing the blubber upon the return of the ship to port. The English meanwhile stuck resolutely to bay whaling, and didn't make the transfer to pelagic (offshore) whaling until long after.\nIn 1719, the Dutch began \"regular and intensive whaling\" in the [[Davis Strait]], between [[Greenland]] and Canada's [[Baffin Island]].<ref>Ross (1979), p. 94. For a century or so prior to this date the Dutch and Dano-Norwegians had irregularly sent out whaling and trading voyages to the region.</ref> The British [[South Sea Company]] financed 172 whaling voyages to Greenland from London's [[Greenland Dock|Howland Dock]] between 1725 and 1732. Beginning in 1733, the British Government offered a 'bounty' for whale oil, leading to further expansion. However, due to reductions in the bounty and wars with America and France, London's Greenland fleet fell to 19 in 1796.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century [[North Frisian Islands|North Frisian Islanders]] had a reputation of being very skilled mariners, and most Dutch and English whaling ships bound for Greenland and Svalbard would recruit their crew from these islands.<ref name=\"Zacchi13\">Zacchi (1986). p. 13.</ref>  Around the year 1700, [[F\u00f6hr]] island had a total population of roughly 6,000, of whom 1,600 were whalers.<ref name=\"Zacchi13\" /> In 1762, 25% of all shipmasters on Dutch whaling vessels were people from F\u00f6hr,<ref>Faltings (2011), p. 17.</ref> and the [[South Sea Company]]'s  commanding officers and harpooners were exclusively from F\u00f6hr.<ref name=\"Zacchi13\" /> [[Sylt]] island and [[Borkum]] island were also notable homes of whaling personnel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Die blutige Jagd nach Moby Dick in Norddeutschland|language=German|first=Edgar S.|last=Hasse|work=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]|date=19 January 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe British would continue to send out whalers to the [[Arctic]] fishery into the 20th century, sending their last on the eve of the [[First World War]].\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n{{Main|Whaling in Japan}}\n[[File:HokusaiGotoKujiratsuki.jpg|thumb|''Whaling Scene on the Coast of [[Got\u014d, Nagasaki|Got\u014d]]'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hokusai]], c. 1830]]\nThe oldest written mention of whaling in Japanese records is from [[Kojiki]], the oldest Japanese historical book, which was written in the 7th century CE. This book describes whale meat being eaten by [[Emperor Jimmu]]. In [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]], an anthology of poems from the 8th century CE, the word \"Whaling\" (\u3044\u3055\u306a\u3068\u308a) was frequently used in depicting the ocean or beaches.\n\nOne of the first records of whaling using harpoons is from the 1570s at Morosaki, a bay attached to [[Ise Bay]]. This method of whaling spread to Kii (before 1606), Shikoku (1624), northern Kyushu (1630s), and Nagato (around 1672).\n\nKakuemon Wada, later known as Kakuemon Taiji, was said to have invented net whaling sometime between 1675 and 1677. This method soon spread to Shikoku (1681) and northern Kyushu (1684)\n\nUsing the techniques developed by [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]], the Japanese mainly hunted four species of whale: the North Pacific right, the humpback, the fin, and the [[gray whale]]. They also caught the occasional blue, sperm, or sei/Bryde's whale .\n\nIn 1853, the US naval officer [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] forced Japan to open up to foreign trade. One purpose of his mission was to gain access to ports for the American whaling fleet in the north-west [[Pacific Ocean]]. Japan's traditional whaling was eventually replaced in the late 19th century and early 20th century with modern methods.\n\n=== Britain ===\n{{Main|Whaling in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Cook-whaling.jpg|thumb|''A View of Whale Fishery'', 1790, from [[Captain Cook]]'s voyages]]\nBritain's involvement in whaling extended from 1611 to the 1960s and had three phases. The Northern (or Arctic) whale fishery lasted from 1611 to 1914 and involved whaling primarily off [[Greenland]], and particularly the [[Davis Strait]]. The Southern (or South Seas) whale fishery was active from 1775 to 1859 and involved whale hunting first in the South Atlantic, then in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. British law defined and differentiated the two trades. Finally, modern British involvement in whaling extended from 1904 to 1963. Each of these three trades involved different species of whales as targets.<ref>[http://www.britishwhaling.org/ British Southern Whale Fishery website.]</ref>\n\n==== Northern whale fishery ====\nFrom 1753 to 1837 whalers from Whitby were active in the Davis Strait. In 1832 the ''Phoenix'' was the only vessel to go out, returning with a record 234 tons of oil. The owners of the ''Phoenix'', the Chapmans, therefore sent out two ships in 1833, the {{ship||Camden|1813 ship|2}} and the ''Phoenix''.<ref>Weatherill (1908), p. 129.</ref> Both vessels returned with large volumes of oil,<ref name=\"Young\">Young (1840), p. 199.</ref> but the price of whale oil and whalebone had fallen. After unsuccessful voyages in 1937 both ships were withdrawn from whaling, ending whaling from Whitby.<ref name=\"Young\" /><ref>Weatherill (1908), p. 378.</ref>\n\n==== Southern whale fishery ====\nThe Southern fishery was launched when [[Samuel Enderby]], along with [[Alexander Champion (businessman)|Alexander Champion]] and [[John St Barbe]], using American vessels and crews, sent out twelve whaleships in 1776.<ref>Jackson (1978), p. 92.</ref> In 1786, the Triumph was the first British whaler to be sent east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and in 1788, the whaler ''Emilia'' was sent west around [[Cape Horn]] into the Pacific Ocean to become the first ship of any nation to conduct whaling operations in the [[Southern Ocean]]. ''Emilia'' returned to London in 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of [[whale oil]].<ref name=\"Quarterly\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=UINZAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA321#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Quarterly Review, Volume 63, London:John Murray, 1839, page 321].</ref>  The first sperm whale killed in the Southern fishery was taken off the coast of Chile on 3 March 1789.\n\nIn 1784 the British had 15 whaleships in the southern fishery, all from London. Between 1793 and 1799 there was an average of 60 vessels in the trade, increasing to 72 in 1800\u20131809.<ref>Stackpole (1972), p. 282.</ref> The first sperm whale off the coast of [[New South Wales]], Australia, was taken by the ship ''Britannia'' (Commander Thomas Melvill) in October 1791.<ref>Letter from Commander Thomas Melvill to Chas. Enderby & sons in London detailing this catch. [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library]] Sydney.</ref>\n\nIn 1819 the British whaler ''Syren'', under [[Coffin (whaling family)|Frederick Coffin]] of Nantucket, sailed to the coastal waters of Japan. She returned to London on 21 April 1822, with 346 tons of whale oil. By 1825 the British had 24 vessels there.<ref>Mawar (1999), p.126.</ref>\n\nThe number of vessels being fitted out annually for the southern fishery declined from 68 in 1820 to 31 in 1824. In 1825, there were 90 ships in the southern fishery, but by 1835 it had dwindled to 61 and by 1843 only 9 vessels left for the southern fishery. In 1859 the trade from London ended.\n\n==== Antarctic whaling ====\nThe [[History of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|shore stations on the island of South Georgia]] were at the center of the Antarctic whaling industry from its beginnings in 1904 until the late 1920s when [[Pelagic fish|pelagic]] whaling increased. The activity on the island remained substantial until around 1960, when Norwegian\u2013British Antarctic whaling came to an end.<ref>Proulx, Jean-Pierre. Whaling in the North Atlantic: From Earliest Times to the Mid-19th Century. (1986).</ref>\n\n=== France ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nIn 1786, William Rotch, Sr. established a colony of Nantucket whalemen in [[Dunkirk]]. By 1789 Dunkirk had 14 whaling ships sailing to Brazil, [[Walvis Bay]], and other areas of the South Atlantic to hunt sperm and right whales. In 1790 Rotch sent the first French whalers into the Pacific. The majority of the French whaling ships were lost during the [[Anglo-French War (1793-1802)]]. Whaling began to revive after the war ended, but when [[Napoleon]] came to power Rotch's holdings in Dunkirk were seized.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the government issued subsidies in an attempt to revive whaling, and in 1832 this effort succeeded. In 1835 the first French whaleship, the Gange, reached the Gulf of Alaska and found abundant right whales. In 1836, the first French whaler reached [[New Zealand]]. In 1851, the French government passed a law to encourage whaling but this was not successful. Whaling in France ended in 1868.\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|Whaling in Iceland}}\nIn 1883 the first whaling station was established in Alptafjordur, [[Iceland]], by a Norwegian company.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 76.</ref> Between 1889 and 1903 nine more companies established themselves in Iceland. Catching peaked in 1902, when 1,305 whales were caught to produce 40,000 barrels of oil. Whale hunting had largely declined by 1910, when only 170 whales were caught.\n\nA ban on whaling was imposed by the [[Althing]] in 1915. In 1935 an Icelandic company established a whaling station that shut down after only five seasons. In 1948, another Icelandic company, Hvalur H/F, purchased a naval base at the head of [[Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]] and converted it into a whaling station. Between 1948 and 1975, an average of 250 Fin, 65 Sei, and 78 sperm whales were taken annually, as well as a few blue and [[humpback whale]]s. Unlike the majority of commercial whaling at the time, this operation was based on the sale of frozen meat and meat meal, rather than oil. Most of the meat was exported to [[England]], while the meal was sold locally as cattle feed.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 646.</ref>\n\n=== Scandinavia ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nScandinavia's whaling industry invented many new techniques in the 19th century, with most inventions occurring in Norway. Jacob Nicolai Wals\u00f8e was probably the first person to suggest mounting a harpoon gun in the bows of a steamship, while Arent Christian Dahl experimented with an explosive harpoon in [[Varanger Fjord]] (1857\u20131860). In 1863 [[Svend Foyn]] invented a harpoon with a flexible joint between the head and shaft and adapted Wals\u00f8e and Dahl's ideas, initiating the modern whaling era.\n\nLater, cannon-fired harpoons, strong cables, and steam winches were mounted on maneuverable, steam-powered catcher boats. They made possible the targeting of large and fast-swimming whale species that were taken to shore-based stations for processing. Breech-loading cannons were introduced in 1925; pistons were introduced in 1947 to reduce recoil. These highly efficient devices reduced whale populations to the point where large-scale commercial whaling became unsustainable.\n\n==== Finnmark ====\nIn February 1864, [[Svend Foyn]] began his first whale-hunting trip to [[Finnmark]] in the schooner-rigged, steam-driven whale catcher ''Spes et Fides'' (Hope & Faith). The ship had seven guns on her forecastle, each firing a harpoon and grenade separately. Several whales were seen, but only four were captured.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), pp. 28\u201329.</ref> After two unsuccessful trips in 1866 and 1867, he invented a harpoon gun that fired a grenade and harpoon at the same time and was able to catch thirty whales in 1868.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 30.</ref> He patented his grenade-tipped harpoon gun two years later.\n\nFoyn was given a virtual monopoly on the trade in Finnmark in 1873, which lasted until 1882.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 32.</ref> Despite this, local citizens established a whaling company in 1876, and soon others defied his monopoly and formed companies. Unrestricted hunting began in 1883, triggering a large increase in the number of whale catchers.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), pp. 34\u201335.</ref> At the peak, in 1896\u20131898, between 1,000 and 1,200 whales were caught each year. The last station closed down in 1904.\n\n==== Spitsbergen ====\nIn 1903, the wooden steamship Telegraf (737 gross tons) embarked on a whale catching trip to [[Spitsbergen]]. She returned with 1,960 barrels of oil produced from a catch of 57 whales, of which 42 were blue whales.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 98.</ref> By 1905, there were eight companies operating around Spitsbergen and [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]], and 559 whales (337 blue) were caught to produce 18,660 barrels. Operations were suspended in 1912.\n\n=== Faroe Islands ===\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2019}}\n{{See also|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Streymoy, abandoned whaling station at Vi\u00f0 \u00c1ir (1).jpg|thumb|The Whaling Station Vi\u00f0 \u00c1ir on Streymoy, Faroe Islands, is the only Norwegian built whaling station in the northern hemisphere still standing.

It revived with the invention of harpoons shot from cannons, explosive tips and factory ships, which allowed distant whaling.

The convention was not enforceable, and a record ~43,000 whales were caught in 1931. In 1932, whaling companies formed a cartel, which cut harvests for two years, but then failed. A 1937 convention agreed to shorter seasons and to sparing bowhead, gray and right whales, and whales under a minimum size. Ships killed faster to harvest as many as possible in the shorter season.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nIn 1946, 15 whaling nations formed the [[International Whaling Commission]], with membership also open to non-whaling nations. It prohibited killing gray, humpback and right whales, limited hunting seasons, and set an Antarctic limit of 16,000 \"[[Blue Whale Unit]]s\" per year, but again had no enforcement ability. In 1949\u20131952 more than 2,000 humpbacks per year were harvested in the Antarctic, despite an annual quota of 1,250. In 1959\u20131964, there were disagreements over a moratorium on blue whales and humpbacks, with scientific advice eventually recommending a limit of 2,800 blue whale units. The IWC adopted quotas of 8,000. In 1970 the United States prohibited import of whale products by adding all commercial whales to its Endangered Species List.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nProposals for 10-year moratoria were rejected in 1971, 1972 and 1974, but species quotas were adopted and reduced. Consumer boycotts focused on Japanese and Russian products began in 1974, to protest the hunting of large whales by these countries. In 1978, the IWC called for an end to international trade in whale products. In 1982, the IWC adopted a ban on commercial whaling, to start in 1986. Japan, Norway and the USSR filed objections so the moratorium would not apply to them. Chile and Peru also filed objections, but Peru later agreed to be covered, and Chile stopped whaling.<ref name=\"smith\">{{Cite journal |last=SMITH |first=GARE |date=1984 |title=The International Whaling Commission: An Analysis of the Past and Reflections on the Future |journal=Natural Resources Lawyer |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=543\u2013567|jstor=40922570 }}</ref>\n\nNo international quotas were ever put on [[beluga whale]]s and [[narwhal]]s; 1,000 to 2,000 of each have been killed each year to the present, mostly in Alaska, Canada and Greenland.<ref name=\"wittig\">{{Cite biorxiv |last=Wittig |first=Lars |date=2016-06-18 |title=Meta population modelling of narwhals in East Canada and West Greenland - 2017 |biorxiv=059691}}</ref><ref name=\"sar\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-region |title=Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports (SARs) by Region :: NOAA Fisheries |last=Fisheries |first=NOAA |website=fisheries.noaa.gov |access-date=7 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503233639/https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-region |archivedate=3 May 2018|date=17 September 2018  }} includes struck and lost.</ref>\n\n===Catches by country and year===\nSources: IWC Summary Catch Database version 6.1, July 2016,<ref name=\"catch\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ulqwxv1nz794f4z/AABXkNwPtZ1L1WuLogcv4xWEa?dl= |title=IWCDBv6.1 |date=July 2016 |website=IWC |language=en |access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref> which includes great whales, orcas (mostly caught by Norway and USSR), bottlenose whales (mostly Norway), pilot whales (mostly Norway), and Baird's Beaked Whales (mostly Japan).

Whaling has been an important subsistence and economic activity in multiple regions throughout human history. Commercial whaling dramatically reduced in importance during the 19th century due to the development of alternatives to whale oil for lighting, and the collapse in whale populations. Nevertheless, some nations continue to hunt whales even today.\n\n== Early history ==\n[[File:Sombrero de jefe de balleneros Nutka (M.

This method is still used for smaller species such as [[pilot whale]]s, [[beluga whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s and [[narwhal]]s, as described in ''[[A Pattern of Islands]]'', a memoir published by British administrator [[Arthur Grimble]] in 1952.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Pattern of Islands.|last=Grimble, Arthur.|date=2012|publisher=Eland Publishing|isbn=9781780600260|location=London|oclc=836405865}}</ref>\n\nAnother early method used a [[drogue]] (a semi-floating object) such as a wooden drum or an inflated sealskin tied to an arrow or a harpoon. Once the missile had been shot into a whale's body, the buoyancy and drag from the drogue would eventually cause the whale to tire, allowing it to be approached and killed. Cultures that practiced whaling with drogues included the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Inuit]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and the [[Basques|Basque people]] of the [[Bay of Biscay]]. The [[Bangudae Petroglyphs|Bangudae petroglyphs]] show [[sperm whale]]s, [[humpback whale]]s and [[North Pacific right whale]]s surrounded by boats, and suggest that drogues, harpoons and lines were being used to kill small whales as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BCE.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=Rock art hints at whaling origins|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3638853.stm|date=20 April 2004|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> Cetacean bones of the same period were also found in the area, reflecting the importance of whales in the diet of prehistoric coastal people.\n\nWhale bones recovered near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] raise the possibility that whales were hunted in the Mediterranean Sea by [[ancient Rome]]<ref name=\"RodriguesCharpentier2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Rodrigues|first1=Ana S.

American whaling's origins were in New York and New England, including [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts and nearby cities. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 18th century whaling in [[Nantucket]] had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and traveling as far as South Pacific waters. During the [[American Revolution]], the British navy targeted American whaling ships as legitimate prizes. In turn, many whalers fitted out as privateers against the British.\n\nWhaling recovered after the war ended in 1783 and the industry began to prosper, using bases at Nantucket and then [[New Bedford]]. Whalers took greater economic risks in search of profit, expanding their hunting grounds. Investment and financing arrangements allowed managers of whaling ventures to share their risks by selling some equity, but retain a substantial portion of the profit. As a result, they had little incentive to plan their voyages to minimize risk.<ref>Eric Hilt, \"Investment and Diversification in the American Whaling Industry.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 2007 67(2): 292\u2013314. {{ISSN|0022-0507}}</ref>\n\nTen thousand seamen manned the ships, including more than 3,000 African American seamen.<ref>David Moment, \"The Business of Whaling in America in the 1850s,\" ''Business History Review,'' Fall 1957, 31#3 pp 261-291</ref> Early whaling efforts concentrated on right whales and humpbacks, which were found near the American coast. As these populations declined and the market for whale products grew, American whalers began hunting sperm whales. The sperm whale was particularly prized for [[spermaceti]], a dense waxy substance that burns with an exceedingly bright flame that is found in the [[spermaceti organ]], located forward and above the skull. Hunting sperm whales required longer whaling voyages.\n\nWhale oil was essential for illuminating homes and businesses in the 19th century, and lubricated the machines of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Baleen]] (the long [[keratin]] strips that hang from the top of whales' mouths) was used by manufacturers in the United States and Europe to make varied consumer goods.\n\nBritish competition and import duties drove New England whaling ships out of the North Atlantic and into the southern oceans, ultimately making whaling into a global economic enterprise. The mid 19th century was the golden age of American whaling.\n\nFrom the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when Confederate raiders targeted American whalers, through the early 20th century, the American whaling industry suffered economic competition, especially from [[kerosene]], a superior fuel for lighting.<ref>Dolin (2007)</ref>\n\n===== Localities =====\n[[File:Der Wal und seine Produkte 01.jpg|thumb|\"The whale and its products\", {{circa|1900}}]]\nA number of New England towns were heavily involved in whaling, particularly [[Nantucket]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. Nantucket began whaling in 1690 after recruiting a whaling instructor, Ichabod Paddock.<ref>Starbuck (1878), p.17.</ref> The south side of the island was divided into three and a half mile sections, each with a mast erected to look for the spouts of right whales. Once a whale was sighted, rowing boats were sent from the shore. If the whale was successfully killed it was towed ashore, [[Flensing|flensed]] (i.e., the [[blubber]] was cut off), and the blubber boiled in cauldrons known as \"[[try pot]]s\". Even when whales were caught far offshore, the blubber was still boiled on shore well into the 18th century. New Bedford whaling was established when prominent Nantucket whaling families moved their operations to the town for economic reasons, and made New Bedford the fourth busiest port in the United States. In [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''<ref>Melville's ''Moby-Dick''</ref> the narrator begins his whaling voyage from New Bedford.\n\nIn the late 1870s, schooners began hunting humpbacks in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. In 1880, with the decline of [[Menhaden#Relation to humans|menhaden fish]], steamers began to switch to hunting fin and [[humpback whales]] using bomb lances. This has been called \"shoot-and-salvage\" because of the high-rate of loss due to whales sinking, lines breaking, etc. The first such whale hunting ship was the steamer ''Mabel Bird'', which towed whale carcasses to an oil processing plant in [[Boothbay Harbor]]. At its height in 1885 four or five steamers were engaged in whale fishery at Boothbay Harbour, dwindling to one by the end of the decade. Over 100 whales were killed annually during some years. The fishery ended in the late 1890s.\n\n===== Technological advancement  =====\nIn the 1850s, the Euro\u2013American whalemen began a serious attempt at catching [[rorqual]]s such as the [[blue whale]] and [[fin whale]].  In the 1860s Captain [[Thomas Welcome Roys]] invented a rocket harpoon, making a significant contribution to the development of the California whaling industry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sharpe|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Winter|first2=Frank H.|date=1971-12-01|title=The California Whaling Rocket and the Men behind It|journal=California Historical Quarterly|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.2307/25157350|issn=0097-6059|jstor=25157350}}</ref> In 1877, John Nelson Fletcher, a pyrotechnist, and a former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldier, Robert L.

Hammer and the Dutchman Captain C. J. Bottemanne also imitated Roys' rocket harpoon. Hammer formed the Danish Fishing Company, which operated from 1865 to 1871.  Botteman formed the Netherlands Whaling Company, which operated from 1869 to 1872.\n\n===== Legacy =====\nIn 1996, the New Bedford Whaling National Historic Site was established, offering exhibits on the history of the \"City that Lit the World\".<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nebe New Bedford Whaling National Historic Site]</ref>\n\n==== Pacific Northwest ====\n{{Main|Whaling on the Pacific Northwest Coast}}\nWhaling on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast encompassed both [[aboriginal whaling|aboriginal]] and commercial whaling.

Commercial whaling in British Columbia and southeast Alaska ended in the late 1960s.\n\n=== Basque Country ===\n{{Main|History of Basque whaling}}\nThe first mention of [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] whaling was made in 1059,<ref name=\"Ellis 1991, p.45\">Ellis (1991), p.45.</ref> when it was said to have been practiced at the Basque town of [[Bayonne]]. The fishery spread to what is now the Spanish Basque Country in 1150, when King [[Sancho the Wise]] of [[Navarre]] granted petitions for the warehousing of such commodities as whalebone (baleen).<ref name=\"Ellis 1991, p.45\"/> At first, they hunted the [[North Atlantic right whale]], using watchtowers (known as vigias) to look for their distinctive twin vapor spouts.\n\nBy the 14th century, Basque whalers were making \"seasonal trips\" to the [[English Channel]] and southern [[Ireland]]. The fishery spread to Terranova ([[Labrador]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]) in the second quarter of the 16th century,<ref>Barkham (1984), p. 515.</ref> and to [[Iceland]] by the early 17th century.<ref>Rafnsson (2006), p. 4.</ref> They established whaling stations in Terranova, mainly in [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]],<ref>Between 1550 and the early 17th century, Red Bay, known as Balea Baya (Whale Bay), was a centre for Basque whaling operations.</ref> and hunted bowheads as well as right whales.\n\nThe fishery in Terranova declined for a variety of reasons, including the conflicts between Spain and other European powers during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, attacks by hostile [[Inuit]], declining whale populations, and perhaps the opening up of the [[Spitsbergen]] fishery in 1611.\n\nThe first voyages to Spitsbergen by the English, Dutch, and Danish relied on Basque specialists, with the Basque provinces sending out their own whaler in 1612. The following season [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] and [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] sent out a combined eleven or twelve whalers to the Spitsbergen fishery, but most were driven off by the Dutch and English.<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 7\u20138.</ref><ref name=\"Markham 1881 pp. 11\">See the accounts of the 1613 season by [[William Baffin|Baffin]] (pp. 38\u201353) and [[Robert Fotherby|Fotherby]] (pp. 54\u201368) in Markham (1881) and [[Hessel Gerritsz|Gerrits]] (pp. 11\u201338) in Conway (1904).</ref>  Two more ships were sent by a merchant in San Sebasti\u00e1n in 1615, but both were driven away by the Dutch. Conflict over the Spitsbergen whaling grounds between the English, French, Dutch and Danish continued until 1638.\n\nWhale fishing in Iceland and Spitsbergen continued at least into the 18th century, but Basque whaling in those regions appears to have ended in 1756 at the beginning of the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>Du Pasquier (1984), p. 538.</ref>\n\n===Greenland and Spitsbergen===\n[[File:Abraham Storck - Walvisvangst.jpg|thumb|''Whaling'', by [[Abraham Storck]]]]\n[[File:Whaling-dangers of the whale fishery.jpeg|thumb|''Dangers of the Whale Fishery'', by W.

The expedition was a disaster, with both ships sent being lost. The crews returned to England in a ship from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].<ref>See the accounts by [[Thomas Edge|Edge]] (pp. 12-15) and [[Jonas Poole|Poole]] (pp. 34\u201340) in Purchas (1625).</ref> The following year two more ships were sent. Other countries followed suit, with Amsterdam and [[Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] each sending a ship north. The latter ship returned to Spain with a full cargo of oil. Such a fabulous return resulted in a fleet of whaleships being sent to Spitsbergen in 1613. The Muscovy Company sent seven, backed by a monopoly charter granted by [[James I of England|King James I]]. They met with twenty other whaleships (eleven or twelve Basque, five French, and three Dutch), as well as a London interloper, which were either ordered away or forced to pay a fine of some sort.<ref name=\"Markham 1881 pp. 11\"/> The [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], France, and Spain all protested against this treatment, but James I held fast to his claim of sovereignty over Spitsbergen.\n \t\nThe following three and a half decades witnessed numerous clashes between the various nations (as well as infighting among the English), often merely posturing, but sometimes resulting in bloodshed. This jealousy stemmed as much from the mechanics of early whaling as from straightforward international animosities. In the first years of the fishery England, France, the United Provinces and later Denmark\u2013Norway shipped expert Basque whalemen for their expeditions. At the time Basque whaling relied on the utilization of stations ashore where blubber could be processed into oil. In order to allow a rapid transference of this technique to Spitsbergen, suitable anchorages had to be selected, of which there were only a limited number, in particular on the west coast of the island.<ref>Jackson (1978), p. 12.</ref>\n \t\nEarly in 1614, the Dutch formed the ''[[Noordsche Compagnie]]'' (Northern Company), a cartel composed of several independent chambers (each representing a particular port). The company sent fourteen ships supported by three or four men-of-war this year, while the English sent a fleet of thirteen ships and pinnaces. Equally matched, they agreed to split the coast between themselves, to the exclusion of third parties. The English received the four principal harbors in the middle of the west coast, while the Dutch could settle anywhere to the south or north. The agreement explicitly stated that it was only meant to last for this season.<ref>Purchas (1625), pp. 16\u201317; Conway (1906), pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n \t\nIn 1615 the Dutch arrived with a fleet of eleven ships and three men-of-war under [[Adriaen Block]], occupied [[Fairhaven, Svalbard|Fairhaven]], [[Bellsund|Bell Sound]], and [[Hornsund|Horn Sound]] by force, and built the first permanent structure on Spitsbergen: a wooden hut to store their equipment in. The ten ships sent by the Muscovy Company were relegated to the south side of Fairhaven, [[Forlandsundet|Sir Thomas Smith's Bay]], and [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Ice Sound]].<ref>Purchas (1625), p. 17; Conway (1906), p. 84.</ref> The Danes meanwhile sent a fleet of five sail under [[Gabriel Kruse]] to demand a toll from the foreign whalers and in doing so assert [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV's]] claim of sovereignty over the region, but both the English and Dutch rebuffed his efforts\u2014two ships from Bordeaux chartered by a merchant in San Sebastian were also sent away by the Dutch.<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), pp. 46\u201348.</ref> The following year, 1616, the English, with a fleet of ten ships, occupied all the major harbors, appropriated the Dutch hut, and made a rich haul, while the Dutch, preoccupied with [[Jan Mayen]], only sent four ships to Spitsbergen, which \"kept together in odd places... and made a poor voyage.\"<ref>Purchas (1625), p. 18; Conway (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n \nIn 1617 a ship from [[Vlissingen]] whaling in Horn Sound had its cargo seized by the English vice-admiral.<ref>Conway (1906), pp. 95\u2013101.</ref> Angry, the following season the Dutch sent nearly two dozen ships to Spitsbergen. Five of the fleet attacked two English ships, killing three men in the process, and also burned down the English station in Horn Sound.<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 42\u201366.</ref> Negotiations between the two nations followed in 1619, with James I, while still claiming sovereignty, would not enforce it for the following three seasons.<ref>Conway (1906), p. 124.</ref> When this concession expired, the English twice (in 1623<ref>Conway (1906), pp. 133\u2013134.</ref> and 1624<ref>Conway (1906), pp. 138\u2013139.</ref>) tried to expel the Dutch from Spitsbergen, failing both times.\n \t\nIn 1619 the Dutch and Danes, who had sent their first whaling expedition to Spitsbergen in 1617, firmly settled themselves on [[Amsterdam Island (Spitsbergen)|Amsterdam Island]], a small island on the northwestern tip of Spitsbergen; while the English did the same in the fjords to the south. The Danish\u2013Dutch settlement came to be called [[Smeerenburg]], which would become the centre of operations for the latter in the first decades of the fishery. Numerous place names attest to the various nations' presence, including Copenhagen Bay (''[[Kobbefjorden]]'') and [[Danes Island]] (''Dansk\u00f8ya''), where the Danes established a station from 1631\u20131658; Port Louis or Refuge Fran\u00e7ais (''[[Hamburgbukta]]''), where the French had a station from 1633\u20131638, until they were driven away by the Danes (see below); and finally English Bay (''[[Engelskbukta]]''), as well as the number of features named by English whalemen and explorers\u2014for example, Isfjorden, Bellsund, and Hornsund, to name a few.\n \t\nHostilities continued after 1619. In 1626 nine ships from Hull and York destroyed the Muscovy Company's fort and station in Bell Sound, and sailed to their own in Midterhukhamna.<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 174\u2013175.</ref> Here they were found by the heavily armed flagship of the London whaling fleet; a two-hour battle ensued, resulting in defeat for the Hull and York fleet and their expulsion from Spitsbergen.<ref>Appleby (2008), pp. 39\u201341.</ref> In 1630 both the ships of Hull and [[Great Yarmouth]], who had recently joined the trade, were driven away clean (empty) by the ships from London. From 1631 to 1633, the Danes, French, and Dutch quarreled with each other, resulting in the expulsion of the Danes from Smeerenburg and the French from Copenhagen Bay. In 1634 the Dutch burned down one of the Danes' huts.<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), p. 190.</ref> There were also two battles this season, one between the English and French (the latter won)<ref>Henrat (1984), p. 545.</ref> and the other between London and Yarmouth (the latter won, as well).<ref>Conway (1904), pp. 176\u2013179.</ref> In 1637<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> and again in 1638 the Danes drove the French out of Port Louis and seized their cargoes. In the former year they also seized a French ship in the open sea and detained it in Copenhagen Bay,<ref>Du Pasquier (2000), p. 83, 323.</ref> while in the latter year they also held two Dutch ships captive in the same bay for over a month, which led to protests from the Dutch.<ref>Dalg\u00e5rd (1962), pp. 214\u2013215.</ref> Following the events of 1638 hostilities, for the most part, ceased, with the exception of a few minor incidents in the 1640s between the French and Danes, as well as between Copenhagen and Hamburg and London and Yarmouth, respectively.\n \t\nThe species hunted was the [[bowhead whale]], a baleen whale that yielded large quantities of oil and baleen. The whales entered the fjords in the spring following the breakup of the ice. They were spotted by the whalemen from suitable vantage points, and pursued by ''shallops'', ''chaloupes'' or ''chalupas'', which were manned by six men. (These terms derive from the Basque word \"txalupa\", used to name the whaling boats that were widely utilized during the golden era of Basque whaling in Labrador in the 16th century.) The whale was harpooned and lanced to death and either towed to the stern of the ship or to the shore at low tide, where men with long knives would flense (cut up) the blubber. The blubber was boiled in large copper kettles and cooled in large wooden vessels, after which it was funneled into casks. The stations at first only consisted of tents of sail and crude furnaces, but were soon replaced by more permanent structures of wood and brick, such as Smeerenburg for the Dutch, [[L\u00e6gerneset]] for the English, and Copenhagen Bay for the Danes.\n \t\t \t\nBeginning in the 1630s, for the Dutch at least, whaling expanded into the open sea. Gradually whaling in the open sea and along the ice floes to the west of Spitsbergen replaced bay whaling. At first, the blubber was tried out at the end of the season at Smeerenburg or elsewhere along the coast, but after mid-century the stations were abandoned entirely in favor of processing the blubber upon the return of the ship to port. The English meanwhile stuck resolutely to bay whaling, and didn't make the transfer to pelagic (offshore) whaling until long after.\nIn 1719, the Dutch began \"regular and intensive whaling\" in the [[Davis Strait]], between [[Greenland]] and Canada's [[Baffin Island]].<ref>Ross (1979), p. 94. For a century or so prior to this date the Dutch and Dano-Norwegians had irregularly sent out whaling and trading voyages to the region.</ref> The British [[South Sea Company]] financed 172 whaling voyages to Greenland from London's [[Greenland Dock|Howland Dock]] between 1725 and 1732. Beginning in 1733, the British Government offered a 'bounty' for whale oil, leading to further expansion. However, due to reductions in the bounty and wars with America and France, London's Greenland fleet fell to 19 in 1796.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century [[North Frisian Islands|North Frisian Islanders]] had a reputation of being very skilled mariners, and most Dutch and English whaling ships bound for Greenland and Svalbard would recruit their crew from these islands.<ref name=\"Zacchi13\">Zacchi (1986). p. 13.</ref>  Around the year 1700, [[F\u00f6hr]] island had a total population of roughly 6,000, of whom 1,600 were whalers.<ref name=\"Zacchi13\" /> In 1762, 25% of all shipmasters on Dutch whaling vessels were people from F\u00f6hr,<ref>Faltings (2011), p. 17.</ref> and the [[South Sea Company]]'s  commanding officers and harpooners were exclusively from F\u00f6hr.<ref name=\"Zacchi13\" /> [[Sylt]] island and [[Borkum]] island were also notable homes of whaling personnel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Die blutige Jagd nach Moby Dick in Norddeutschland|language=German|first=Edgar S.|last=Hasse|work=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]|date=19 January 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe British would continue to send out whalers to the [[Arctic]] fishery into the 20th century, sending their last on the eve of the [[First World War]].\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n{{Main|Whaling in Japan}}\n[[File:HokusaiGotoKujiratsuki.jpg|thumb|''Whaling Scene on the Coast of [[Got\u014d, Nagasaki|Got\u014d]]'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hokusai]], c. 1830]]\nThe oldest written mention of whaling in Japanese records is from [[Kojiki]], the oldest Japanese historical book, which was written in the 7th century CE. This book describes whale meat being eaten by [[Emperor Jimmu]]. In [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]], an anthology of poems from the 8th century CE, the word \"Whaling\" (\u3044\u3055\u306a\u3068\u308a) was frequently used in depicting the ocean or beaches.\n\nOne of the first records of whaling using harpoons is from the 1570s at Morosaki, a bay attached to [[Ise Bay]]. This method of whaling spread to Kii (before 1606), Shikoku (1624), northern Kyushu (1630s), and Nagato (around 1672).\n\nKakuemon Wada, later known as Kakuemon Taiji, was said to have invented net whaling sometime between 1675 and 1677. This method soon spread to Shikoku (1681) and northern Kyushu (1684)\n\nUsing the techniques developed by [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]], the Japanese mainly hunted four species of whale: the North Pacific right, the humpback, the fin, and the [[gray whale]]. They also caught the occasional blue, sperm, or sei/Bryde's whale .\n\nIn 1853, the US naval officer [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] forced Japan to open up to foreign trade. One purpose of his mission was to gain access to ports for the American whaling fleet in the north-west [[Pacific Ocean]]. Japan's traditional whaling was eventually replaced in the late 19th century and early 20th century with modern methods.\n\n=== Britain ===\n{{Main|Whaling in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Cook-whaling.jpg|thumb|''A View of Whale Fishery'', 1790, from [[Captain Cook]]'s voyages]]\nBritain's involvement in whaling extended from 1611 to the 1960s and had three phases. The Northern (or Arctic) whale fishery lasted from 1611 to 1914 and involved whaling primarily off [[Greenland]], and particularly the [[Davis Strait]]. The Southern (or South Seas) whale fishery was active from 1775 to 1859 and involved whale hunting first in the South Atlantic, then in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. British law defined and differentiated the two trades. Finally, modern British involvement in whaling extended from 1904 to 1963. Each of these three trades involved different species of whales as targets.<ref>[http://www.britishwhaling.org/ British Southern Whale Fishery website.]</ref>\n\n==== Northern whale fishery ====\nFrom 1753 to 1837 whalers from Whitby were active in the Davis Strait. In 1832 the ''Phoenix'' was the only vessel to go out, returning with a record 234 tons of oil. The owners of the ''Phoenix'', the Chapmans, therefore sent out two ships in 1833, the {{ship||Camden|1813 ship|2}} and the ''Phoenix''.<ref>Weatherill (1908), p. 129.</ref> Both vessels returned with large volumes of oil,<ref name=\"Young\">Young (1840), p. 199.</ref> but the price of whale oil and whalebone had fallen.

''Emilia'' returned to London in 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of [[whale oil]].<ref name=\"Quarterly\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=UINZAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA321#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Quarterly Review, Volume 63, London:John Murray, 1839, page 321].</ref>  The first sperm whale killed in the Southern fishery was taken off the coast of Chile on 3 March 1789.\n\nIn 1784 the British had 15 whaleships in the southern fishery, all from London. Between 1793 and 1799 there was an average of 60 vessels in the trade, increasing to 72 in 1800\u20131809.<ref>Stackpole (1972), p. 282.</ref> The first sperm whale off the coast of [[New South Wales]], Australia, was taken by the ship ''Britannia'' (Commander Thomas Melvill) in October 1791.<ref>Letter from Commander Thomas Melvill to Chas.

She returned to London on 21 April 1822, with 346 tons of whale oil. By 1825 the British had 24 vessels there.<ref>Mawar (1999), p.126.</ref>\n\nThe number of vessels being fitted out annually for the southern fishery declined from 68 in 1820 to 31 in 1824. In 1825, there were 90 ships in the southern fishery, but by 1835 it had dwindled to 61 and by 1843 only 9 vessels left for the southern fishery. In 1859 the trade from London ended.\n\n==== Antarctic whaling ====\nThe [[History of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|shore stations on the island of South Georgia]] were at the center of the Antarctic whaling industry from its beginnings in 1904 until the late 1920s when [[Pelagic fish|pelagic]] whaling increased. The activity on the island remained substantial until around 1960, when Norwegian\u2013British Antarctic whaling came to an end.<ref>Proulx, Jean-Pierre.

By 1789 Dunkirk had 14 whaling ships sailing to Brazil, [[Walvis Bay]], and other areas of the South Atlantic to hunt sperm and right whales. In 1790 Rotch sent the first French whalers into the Pacific. The majority of the French whaling ships were lost during the [[Anglo-French War (1793-1802)]]. Whaling began to revive after the war ended, but when [[Napoleon]] came to power Rotch's holdings in Dunkirk were seized.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the government issued subsidies in an attempt to revive whaling, and in 1832 this effort succeeded. In 1835 the first French whaleship, the Gange, reached the Gulf of Alaska and found abundant right whales. In 1836, the first French whaler reached [[New Zealand]]. In 1851, the French government passed a law to encourage whaling but this was not successful. Whaling in France ended in 1868.\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|Whaling in Iceland}}\nIn 1883 the first whaling station was established in Alptafjordur, [[Iceland]], by a Norwegian company.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 76.</ref> Between 1889 and 1903 nine more companies established themselves in Iceland. Catching peaked in 1902, when 1,305 whales were caught to produce 40,000 barrels of oil. Whale hunting had largely declined by 1910, when only 170 whales were caught.\n\nA ban on whaling was imposed by the [[Althing]] in 1915. In 1935 an Icelandic company established a whaling station that shut down after only five seasons. In 1948, another Icelandic company, Hvalur H/F, purchased a naval base at the head of [[Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]] and converted it into a whaling station. Between 1948 and 1975, an average of 250 Fin, 65 Sei, and 78 sperm whales were taken annually, as well as a few blue and [[humpback whale]]s. Unlike the majority of commercial whaling at the time, this operation was based on the sale of frozen meat and meat meal, rather than oil. Most of the meat was exported to [[England]], while the meal was sold locally as cattle feed.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 646.</ref>\n\n=== Scandinavia ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nScandinavia's whaling industry invented many new techniques in the 19th century, with most inventions occurring in Norway. Jacob Nicolai Wals\u00f8e was probably the first person to suggest mounting a harpoon gun in the bows of a steamship, while Arent Christian Dahl experimented with an explosive harpoon in [[Varanger Fjord]] (1857\u20131860). In 1863 [[Svend Foyn]] invented a harpoon with a flexible joint between the head and shaft and adapted Wals\u00f8e and Dahl's ideas, initiating the modern whaling era.\n\nLater, cannon-fired harpoons, strong cables, and steam winches were mounted on maneuverable, steam-powered catcher boats. They made possible the targeting of large and fast-swimming whale species that were taken to shore-based stations for processing. Breech-loading cannons were introduced in 1925; pistons were introduced in 1947 to reduce recoil. These highly efficient devices reduced whale populations to the point where large-scale commercial whaling became unsustainable.\n\n==== Finnmark ====\nIn February 1864, [[Svend Foyn]] began his first whale-hunting trip to [[Finnmark]] in the schooner-rigged, steam-driven whale catcher ''Spes et Fides'' (Hope & Faith). The ship had seven guns on her forecastle, each firing a harpoon and grenade separately. Several whales were seen, but only four were captured.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), pp. 28\u201329.</ref> After two unsuccessful trips in 1866 and 1867, he invented a harpoon gun that fired a grenade and harpoon at the same time and was able to catch thirty whales in 1868.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 30.</ref> He patented his grenade-tipped harpoon gun two years later.\n\nFoyn was given a virtual monopoly on the trade in Finnmark in 1873, which lasted until 1882.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 32.</ref> Despite this, local citizens established a whaling company in 1876, and soon others defied his monopoly and formed companies. Unrestricted hunting began in 1883, triggering a large increase in the number of whale catchers.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), pp. 34\u201335.</ref> At the peak, in 1896\u20131898, between 1,000 and 1,200 whales were caught each year. The last station closed down in 1904.\n\n==== Spitsbergen ====\nIn 1903, the wooden steamship Telegraf (737 gross tons) embarked on a whale catching trip to [[Spitsbergen]]. She returned with 1,960 barrels of oil produced from a catch of 57 whales, of which 42 were blue whales.<ref>T\u00f8nnessen & Johnsen (1982), p. 98.</ref> By 1905, there were eight companies operating around Spitsbergen and [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]], and 559 whales (337 blue) were caught to produce 18,660 barrels. Operations were suspended in 1912.\n\n=== Faroe Islands ===\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2019}}\n{{See also|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Streymoy, abandoned whaling station at Vi\u00f0 \u00c1ir (1).jpg|thumb|The Whaling Station Vi\u00f0 \u00c1ir on Streymoy, Faroe Islands, is the only Norwegian built whaling station in the northern hemisphere still standing.

It revived with the invention of harpoons shot from cannons, explosive tips and factory ships, which allowed distant whaling. Whaling expanded in the northern hemisphere, then in the southern hemisphere. As each species was reduced to the point where it was hard to find, whalers moved on to the next species, catching blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales, sei whales and minke whales in sequence.<ref name=\"rocha\">{{Cite journal |last=ROCHA |first=ROBERT C., Jr., PHILLIP J.

The convention was not enforceable, and a record ~43,000 whales were caught in 1931. In 1932, whaling companies formed a cartel, which cut harvests for two years, but then failed. A 1937 convention agreed to shorter seasons and to sparing bowhead, gray and right whales, and whales under a minimum size. Ships killed faster to harvest as many as possible in the shorter season.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nIn 1946, 15 whaling nations formed the [[International Whaling Commission]], with membership also open to non-whaling nations. It prohibited killing gray, humpback and right whales, limited hunting seasons, and set an Antarctic limit of 16,000 \"[[Blue Whale Unit]]s\" per year, but again had no enforcement ability. In 1949\u20131952 more than 2,000 humpbacks per year were harvested in the Antarctic, despite an annual quota of 1,250. In 1959\u20131964, there were disagreements over a moratorium on blue whales and humpbacks, with scientific advice eventually recommending a limit of 2,800 blue whale units. The IWC adopted quotas of 8,000. In 1970 the United States prohibited import of whale products by adding all commercial whales to its Endangered Species List.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nProposals for 10-year moratoria were rejected in 1971, 1972 and 1974, but species quotas were adopted and reduced. Consumer boycotts focused on Japanese and Russian products began in 1974, to protest the hunting of large whales by these countries. In 1978, the IWC called for an end to international trade in whale products. In 1982, the IWC adopted a ban on commercial whaling, to start in 1986. Japan, Norway and the USSR filed objections so the moratorium would not apply to them. Chile and Peru also filed objections, but Peru later agreed to be covered, and Chile stopped whaling.<ref name=\"smith\">{{Cite journal |last=SMITH |first=GARE |date=1984 |title=The International Whaling Commission: An Analysis of the Past and Reflections on the Future |journal=Natural Resources Lawyer |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=543\u2013567|jstor=40922570 }}</ref>\n\nNo international quotas were ever put on [[beluga whale]]s and [[narwhal]]s; 1,000 to 2,000 of each have been killed each year to the present, mostly in Alaska, Canada and Greenland.<ref name=\"wittig\">{{Cite biorxiv |last=Wittig |first=Lars |date=2016-06-18 |title=Meta population modelling of narwhals in East Canada and West Greenland - 2017 |biorxiv=059691}}</ref><ref name=\"sar\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-region |title=Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports (SARs) by Region :: NOAA Fisheries |last=Fisheries |first=NOAA |website=fisheries.noaa.gov |access-date=7 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503233639/https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-region |archivedate=3 May 2018|date=17 September 2018  }} includes struck and lost.</ref>\n\n===Catches by country and year===\nSources: IWC Summary Catch Database version 6.1, July 2016,<ref name=\"catch\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ulqwxv1nz794f4z/AABXkNwPtZ1L1WuLogcv4xWEa?dl= |title=IWCDBv6.1 |date=July 2016 |website=IWC |language=en |access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref> which includes great whales, orcas (mostly caught by Norway and USSR), bottlenose whales (mostly Norway), pilot whales (mostly Norway), and Baird's Beaked Whales (mostly Japan).

Aerogel has excellent insulating properties, and the flower is protected from the flame.]] Despite the name, aerogels are solid, rigid, and dry materials that do not resemble a gel in their physical properties: the name comes from the fact that they are made ''from'' gels. Pressing softly on an aerogel typically does not leave even a minor mark; pressing more firmly will leave a permanent depression. Pressing extremely firmly will cause a catastrophic breakdown in the sparse structure, causing it to shatter like glass (a property known as ''[[friability]]''), although more modern variations do not suffer from this. Despite the fact that it is prone to shattering, it is very strong structurally. Its impressive load-bearing abilities are due to the [[Dendrite (metal)|dendritic]] microstructure, in which [[spherical]] particles of average size 2\u20135&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] are fused together into clusters. These clusters form a three-dimensional highly [[Porosity|porous]] structure of almost [[fractal]] chains, with pores just under 100&nbsp;nm. The average size and density of the pores can be controlled during the manufacturing process.\n\nAerogel is a material that is 99.8% air. Aerogels have a porous solid network that contains air pockets, with the air pockets taking up the majority of space within the material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6499|title=What is Aerogel? Theory, Properties and Applications|date=12 December 2013|publisher=azom.com|accessdate=5 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209123257/http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6499|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The dearth of solid material allows aerogel to be almost weightless.\n\nAerogels are good [[Thermal insulation|thermal insulators]] because they almost nullify two of the three methods of [[heat transfer]] \u2013 conduction (they are mostly composed of insulating gas) and convection (the microstructure prevents net gas movement). They are good [[Heat conduction|conductive]] insulators because they are composed almost entirely of gases, which are very poor heat conductors. (Silica aerogel is an especially good insulator because silica is also a poor conductor of heat; a metallic or carbon aerogel, on the other hand, would be less effective.) They are good [[Convective heat transfer|convective]] inhibitors because air cannot circulate through the lattice. Aerogels are poor [[Thermal radiation|radiative]] insulators because infrared radiation (which transfers heat) passes through them.\n\nOwing to its [[hygroscopic]] nature, aerogel feels dry and acts as a strong [[desiccant]]. People handling aerogel for extended periods should wear gloves to prevent the appearance of dry brittle spots on their skin.\n\nThe slight color it does have is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the shorter [[wavelength]]s of [[visible light]] by the nano-sized dendritic structure. This causes it to appear smoky blue against dark backgrounds and yellowish against bright backgrounds.\n\nAerogels by themselves are [[hydrophilic]], and if they absorb moisture they usually suffer a structural change, such as contraction, and deteriorate, but degradation can be prevented by making them [[hydrophobic]], via a chemical treatment. Aerogels with hydrophobic interiors are less susceptible to degradation than aerogels with only an outer hydrophobic layer, even if a crack penetrates the surface.\n\n== Knudsen effect ==\nAerogels may have a [[thermal conductivity]] smaller than that of the gas they contain. This is caused by the  [[Knudsen number|Knudsen effect]], a reduction of thermal conductivity in gases when the size of the cavity encompassing the gas becomes comparable to the [[mean free path]]. Effectively, the cavity restricts the movement of the gas particles, decreasing the thermal conductivity in addition to eliminating convection. For example, thermal conductivity of air is about 25&nbsp;mW/m\u00b7K at STP and in a large container, but decreases to about 5&nbsp;mW/m\u00b7K in a pore 30 nanometers in diameter.<ref>Berge, Axel and Johansson, P\u00e4r (2012) [http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_159807.pdf Literature Review of High Performance Thermal Insulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121114200/http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_159807.pdf |date=21 November 2014 }}. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nAerogel structure results from a [[sol-gel]] [[polymerization]], which is when [[monomers]] (simple molecules) react with other monomers to form a sol or a substance that consists of bonded, cross-linked [[macromolecules]] with deposits of liquid solution among them.  When the material is critically heated, the liquid [[evaporates]] and the bonded, [[cross-linked]] macromolecule frame is left behind.  The result of the polymerization and critical heating is the creation of a material that has a porous strong structure classified as aerogel.<ref>[https://str.llnl.gov/str/Foxhighlight.html Aerogel Structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225170824/https://str.llnl.gov/str/Foxhighlight.html |date=25 December 2014 }}.

After the process of creating aerogel, it will contain a large amount of [[hydroxyl groups]] on the surface.  The hydroxyl groups can cause a strong reaction when the aerogel is placed in water, causing it to catastrophically dissolve in the water.  One way to waterproof the [[hydrophilic]] aerogel is by soaking the aerogel with some chemical base that will replace the surface hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) with non-polar groups (\u2013O''R''), a process which is most effective when ''R'' is an [[aliphatic]] group.<ref>[http://www.vsl.cua.edu/cua_phy/images/c/cf/Aerogel_Aerlon_SilicaAerogels.pdf The Surface Chemistry of Silica Aerogels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201035010/http://energy.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/sa-chemistry.html |date=1 December 2014 }}.

Retrieved on 31 July 2016.</ref>\n\n== Porosity of aerogel ==\nThere are several ways to determine the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas [[adsorption]], mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent on the size of the pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its [[saturation pressure]].  The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula ([[BET theory|BET]]), which gives the specific [[surface area]] of the sample.  At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample.  In mercury porosimetry, the [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force.  The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample.  The sample can be solid particles or pores.  The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network.  The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons.  Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores.<ref>[https://pamelanorris.wordpress.com/resources/pore-structure-of-silica-aerogels/ Pore Structure of Silica Aerogels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201064113/http://energy.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/sa-pore.html |date=1 December 2014 }}.

They have very high [[porosity]] (over 50%, with pore diameter under 100&nbsp;nm) and surface areas ranging between 400\u20131,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/g. They are often manufactured as composite paper: non-woven paper made of [[carbon fiber]]s, impregnated with [[resorcinol]]\u2013[[formaldehyde]] aerogel, and [[Pyrolisis|pyrolyzed]]. Depending on the density, carbon aerogels may be electrically conductive, making composite aerogel paper useful for electrodes in [[capacitor]]s or deionization electrodes. Due to their extremely high surface area, carbon aerogels are used to create [[supercapacitor]]s, with values ranging up to thousands of [[farad]]s based on a capacitance density of 104&nbsp;F/g and 77&nbsp;F/cm<sup>3</sup>. Carbon aerogels are also extremely \"black\" in the infrared spectrum, reflecting only 0.3% of radiation between 250&nbsp;nm and 14.3&nbsp;\u00b5m, making them efficient for [[Solar thermal energy|solar energy]] collectors.\n\nThe term \"aerogel\" to describe airy masses of [[carbon nanotube]]s produced through certain [[chemical vapor deposition]] techniques is incorrect. Such materials can be spun into fibers with strength greater than [[Kevlar]], and unique electrical properties. These materials are not aerogels, however, since they do not have a monolithic internal structure and do not have the regular pore structure characteristic of aerogels.\n\n=== Metal oxide ===\n[[Metal oxide]] aerogels are used as catalysts in various chemical reactions/transformations or as precursors for other materials.\n\nAerogels made with [[aluminium oxide]] are known as alumina aerogels. These aerogels are used as catalysts, especially when \"doped\" with a metal other than aluminium. [[Nickel]]\u2013alumina aerogel is the most common combination. Alumina aerogels are also being considered by [[NASA]] for capturing hypervelocity particles; a formulation doped with [[gadolinium]] and [[terbium]] could [[fluoresce]] at the particle impact site, with the amount of fluorescence dependent on impact energy.\n\nOne of the most notable differences between silica aerogels and metal oxide aerogel is that metal oxide aerogels are often variedly colored.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The precursors are a liquid [[alcohol]] such as ethanol which is mixed with a [[silicon alkoxide]], such as [[tetramethoxysilane]] (TMOS), [[tetraethoxysilane]] (TEOS), and polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) (earlier work used sodium silicates).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dorcheh|first=Soleimani|last2=Abbasi|first2=M.|date=2008|title=Silica Aerogel; Synthesis, Properties, and Characterization|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=199|issue=1\u20133|pages=10\u201326|doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.10.060|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> The solution of silica is mixed with a catalyst and allowed to gel during a [[hydrolysis]] reaction which forms particles of silicon dioxide.<ref name=\"Making silica aerogels\">{{cite web|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/Aerogels/sa-making.html|title=Making silica aerogels|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514144121/http://eetd.lbl.gov/ecs/aerogels/sa-making.html|archivedate=14 May 2009|df=dmy-all|access-date=28 May 2009}}</ref> The oxide suspension begins to undergo [[condensation reaction]]s which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either [[Oxo ligand|M\u2013O\u2013M, \"oxo\" bridges]], or M\u2013OH\u2013M, \"[[-ol|ol]]\" bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Chemistry of Aerogels and their Applications|journal=[[Chemical Reviews]]|volume=102|issue=11|pages=4243\u20134265|doi=10.1021/cr0101306|pmid=12428989|last1=Pierre|first1=A.

Basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels and minimize the shrinkage during the drying process and also strengthen it to prevent pore collapse during drying.<ref name=\"Making silica aerogels\" />\n\nFinally, during the drying process of the aerogel, the liquid surrounding the silica network is carefully removed and replaced with air, while keeping the aerogel intact. Gels where the liquid is allowed to evaporate at a natural rate are known as [[xerogel]]s. As the liquid evaporates, forces caused by [[surface tension]]s of the liquid-solid [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] are enough to destroy the fragile gel network. As a result, xerogels cannot achieve the high porosities and instead peak at lower porosities and exhibit large amounts of shrinkage after drying.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1992|title=Aerogels|journal=[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]]|volume=75|issue=8|pages=2027\u20132036|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1992.tb04461.x|last1=Fricke|first1=Jochen|last2=Emmerling|first2=Andreas}}</ref> To avoid the collapse of fibers during slow solvent evaporation and reduce surface tensions of the liquid-solid interfaces, aerogels can be formed by [[Freeze-drying|lyophilization]] (freeze-drying).

By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a [[supercritical fluid]] state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with [[ethanol]], the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]-miscible liquid such as ethanol or [[acetone]], then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.<ref name=\"Making silica aerogels\" />\n\n[[Resorcinol]]\u2013[[formaldehyde]] aerogel (RF aerogel) is made in a way similar to production of silica aerogel. A carbon aerogel can then be made from this resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde aerogel by [[pyrolysis]] in an [[inert gas]] atmosphere, leaving a matrix of [[carbon]]. It is commercially available as solid shapes, powders, or composite paper. Additives have been successful in enhancing certain properties of the aerogel for the use of specific applications. Aerogel [[Composite material|composites]] have been made using a variety of continuous and discontinuous [[reinforcement]]s. The high aspect ratio of fibers such as [[fiberglass]] have been used to reinforce aerogel composites with significantly improved mechanical properties.\n\n== Safety ==\nSilica-based aerogels are not known to be [[carcinogenic]] or toxic. However, they are a mechanical [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes, skin, respiratory tract, and digestive system. They can also induce dryness of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Therefore, it is recommended that protective gear including respiratory protection, gloves and eye goggles be worn whenever handling or processing bare aerogels.<ref>[http://aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf Cryogel\u00ae 5201, 10201 Safety Data Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223111216/http://www.aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf |date=23 December 2010 }}.

This allows the liquid to be slowly dried off without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from [[capillary action]], as would happen with conventional [[evaporation]].

Aerogel has excellent insulating properties, and the flower is protected from the flame.]] Despite the name, aerogels are solid, rigid, and dry materials that do not resemble a gel in their physical properties: the name comes from the fact that they are made ''from'' gels. Pressing softly on an aerogel typically does not leave even a minor mark; pressing more firmly will leave a permanent depression. Pressing extremely firmly will cause a catastrophic breakdown in the sparse structure, causing it to shatter like glass (a property known as ''[[friability]]''), although more modern variations do not suffer from this. Despite the fact that it is prone to shattering, it is very strong structurally. Its impressive load-bearing abilities are due to the [[Dendrite (metal)|dendritic]] microstructure, in which [[spherical]] particles of average size 2\u20135&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] are fused together into clusters. These clusters form a three-dimensional highly [[Porosity|porous]] structure of almost [[fractal]] chains, with pores just under 100&nbsp;nm. The average size and density of the pores can be controlled during the manufacturing process.\n\nAerogel is a material that is 99.8% air. Aerogels have a porous solid network that contains air pockets, with the air pockets taking up the majority of space within the material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6499|title=What is Aerogel? Theory, Properties and Applications|date=12 December 2013|publisher=azom.com|accessdate=5 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209123257/http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6499|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The lack of solid material allows aerogel to be almost weightless.\n\nAerogels are good [[Thermal insulation|thermal insulators]] because they almost nullify two of the three methods of [[heat transfer]] \u2013 conduction (they are mostly composed of insulating gas) and convection (the microstructure prevents net gas movement). They are good [[Heat conduction|conductive]] insulators because they are composed almost entirely of gases, which are very poor heat conductors. (Silica aerogel is an especially good insulator because silica is also a poor conductor of heat; a metallic or carbon aerogel, on the other hand, would be less effective.) They are good [[Convective heat transfer|convective]] inhibitors because air cannot circulate through the lattice. Aerogels are poor [[Thermal radiation|radiative]] insulators because infrared radiation (which transfers heat) passes through them.\n\nOwing to its [[hygroscopic]] nature, aerogel feels dry and acts as a strong [[desiccant]]. People handling aerogel for extended periods should wear gloves to prevent the appearance of dry brittle spots on their skin.\n\nThe slight color it does have is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the shorter [[wavelength]]s of [[visible light]] by the nano-sized dendritic structure. This causes it to appear smoky blue against dark backgrounds and yellowish against bright backgrounds.\n\nAerogels by themselves are [[hydrophilic]], and if they absorb moisture they usually suffer a structural change, such as contraction, and deteriorate, but degradation can be prevented by making them [[hydrophobic]], via a chemical treatment. Aerogels with hydrophobic interiors are less susceptible to degradation than aerogels with only an outer hydrophobic layer, even if a crack penetrates the surface.\n\n== Knudsen effect ==\nAerogels may have a [[thermal conductivity]] smaller than that of the gas they contain. This is caused by the  [[Knudsen number|Knudsen effect]], a reduction of thermal conductivity in gases when the size of the cavity encompassing the gas becomes comparable to the [[mean free path]]. Effectively, the cavity restricts the movement of the gas particles, decreasing the thermal conductivity in addition to eliminating convection. For example, thermal conductivity of air is about 25&nbsp;mW/m\u00b7K at STP and in a large container, but decreases to about 5&nbsp;mW/m\u00b7K in a pore 30 nanometers in diameter.<ref>Berge, Axel and Johansson, P\u00e4r (2012) [http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_159807.pdf Literature Review of High Performance Thermal Insulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121114200/http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_159807.pdf |date=21 November 2014 }}.

When the material is critically heated, the liquid [[evaporates]] and the bonded, [[cross-linked]] macromolecule frame is left behind.  The result of the polymerization and critical heating is the creation of a material that has a porous strong structure classified as aerogel.<ref>[https://str.llnl.gov/str/Foxhighlight.html Aerogel Structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225170824/https://str.llnl.gov/str/Foxhighlight.html |date=25 December 2014 }}.

After the process of creating aerogel, it will contain a large amount of [[hydroxyl groups]] on the surface.  The hydroxyl groups can cause a strong reaction when the aerogel is placed in water, causing it to catastrophically dissolve in the water.  One way to waterproof the [[hydrophilic]] aerogel is by soaking the aerogel with some chemical base that will replace the surface hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) with non-polar groups (\u2013O''R''), a process which is most effective when ''R'' is an [[aliphatic]] group.<ref>[http://www.vsl.cua.edu/cua_phy/images/c/cf/Aerogel_Aerlon_SilicaAerogels.pdf The Surface Chemistry of Silica Aerogels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201035010/http://energy.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/sa-chemistry.html |date=1 December 2014 }}.

Retrieved on 31 July 2016.</ref>\n\n== Porosity of aerogel ==\nThere are several ways to determine the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas [[adsorption]], mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent on the size of the pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its [[saturation pressure]].  The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula ([[BET theory|BET]]), which gives the specific [[surface area]] of the sample.  At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample.  In mercury porosimetry, the [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force.  The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample.  The sample can be solid particles or pores.  The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network.  The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons.  Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores.<ref>[https://pamelanorris.wordpress.com/resources/pore-structure-of-silica-aerogels/ Pore Structure of Silica Aerogels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201064113/http://energy.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/sa-pore.html |date=1 December 2014 }}.

They have very high [[porosity]] (over 50%, with pore diameter under 100&nbsp;nm) and surface areas ranging between 400\u20131,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/g. They are often manufactured as composite paper: non-woven paper made of [[carbon fiber]]s, impregnated with [[resorcinol]]\u2013[[formaldehyde]] aerogel, and [[Pyrolisis|pyrolyzed]]. Depending on the density, carbon aerogels may be electrically conductive, making composite aerogel paper useful for electrodes in [[capacitor]]s or deionization electrodes. Due to their extremely high surface area, carbon aerogels are used to create [[supercapacitor]]s, with values ranging up to thousands of [[farad]]s based on a capacitance density of 104&nbsp;F/g and 77&nbsp;F/cm<sup>3</sup>. Carbon aerogels are also extremely \"black\" in the infrared spectrum, reflecting only 0.3% of radiation between 250&nbsp;nm and 14.3&nbsp;\u00b5m, making them efficient for [[Solar thermal energy|solar energy]] collectors.\n\nThe term \"aerogel\" to describe airy masses of [[carbon nanotube]]s produced through certain [[chemical vapor deposition]] techniques is incorrect. Such materials can be spun into fibers with strength greater than [[Kevlar]], and unique electrical properties. These materials are not aerogels, however, since they do not have a monolithic internal structure and do not have the regular pore structure characteristic of aerogels.\n\n=== Metal oxide ===\n[[Metal oxide]] aerogels are used as catalysts in various chemical reactions/transformations or as precursors for other materials.\n\nAerogels made with [[aluminium oxide]] are known as alumina aerogels. These aerogels are used as catalysts, especially when \"doped\" with a metal other than aluminium. [[Nickel]]\u2013alumina aerogel is the most common combination. Alumina aerogels are also being considered by [[NASA]] for capturing hypervelocity particles; a formulation doped with [[gadolinium]] and [[terbium]] could [[fluoresce]] at the particle impact site, with the amount of fluorescence dependent on impact energy.\n\nOne of the most notable differences between silica aerogels and metal oxide aerogel is that metal oxide aerogels are often variedly colored.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels and minimize the shrinkage during the drying process and also strengthen it to prevent pore collapse during drying.<ref name=\"Making silica aerogels\" />\n\nFinally, during the drying process of the aerogel, the liquid surrounding the silica network is carefully removed and replaced with air, while keeping the aerogel intact. Gels where the liquid is allowed to evaporate at a natural rate are known as [[xerogel]]s. As the liquid evaporates, forces caused by [[surface tension]]s of the liquid-solid [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] are enough to destroy the fragile gel network. As a result, xerogels cannot achieve the high porosities and instead peak at lower porosities and exhibit large amounts of shrinkage after drying.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1992|title=Aerogels|journal=[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]]|volume=75|issue=8|pages=2027\u20132036|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1992.tb04461.x|last1=Fricke|first1=Jochen|last2=Emmerling|first2=Andreas}}</ref> To avoid the collapse of fibers during slow solvent evaporation and reduce surface tensions of the liquid-solid interfaces, aerogels can be formed by [[Freeze-drying|lyophilization]] (freeze-drying).

By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a [[supercritical fluid]] state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with [[ethanol]], the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]-miscible liquid such as ethanol or [[acetone]], then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.<ref name=\"Making silica aerogels\" />\n\n[[Resorcinol]]\u2013[[formaldehyde]] aerogel (RF aerogel) is made in a way similar to production of silica aerogel. A carbon aerogel can then be made from this resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde aerogel by [[pyrolysis]] in an [[inert gas]] atmosphere, leaving a matrix of [[carbon]]. It is commercially available as solid shapes, powders, or composite paper. Additives have been successful in enhancing certain properties of the aerogel for the use of specific applications. Aerogel [[Composite material|composites]] have been made using a variety of continuous and discontinuous [[reinforcement]]s. The high aspect ratio of fibers such as [[fiberglass]] have been used to reinforce aerogel composites with significantly improved mechanical properties.\n\n== Safety ==\nSilica-based aerogels are not known to be [[carcinogenic]] or toxic. However, they are a mechanical [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes, skin, respiratory tract, and digestive system. They can also induce dryness of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Therefore, it is recommended that protective gear including respiratory protection, gloves and eye goggles be worn whenever handling or processing bare aerogels.<ref>[http://aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf Cryogel\u00ae 5201, 10201 Safety Data Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223111216/http://www.aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf |date=23 December 2010 }}.
