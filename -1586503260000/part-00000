Lyra2 preserves the security, efficiency and flexibility of its predecessor, including: (1) the ability to configure the desired amount of memory, processing time and parallelism to be used by the algorithm; and (2) the capacity of providing a high memory usage with a processing time similar to that obtained with [[scrypt]]. In addition, it brings the following improvements when compared to its predecessor:<ref name=\"lyra2ToC2\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=E.|last2=Simplicio Jr|first2=M. |last3=Barreto|first3=P.|last4=Santos|first4=P.|date=2016-01-01|title=Lyra2: efficient password hashing with high security against time-memory trade-offs|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=PP|issue=99|pages=3096\u20133108|doi=10.1109/TC.2016.2516011|issn=0018-9340}}</ref>\n* it allows a higher security level against attack venues involving [[Time/memory/data tradeoff attack|time-memory trade-offs]]\n* it allows legitimate users to benefit more effectively from the [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] capabilities of their own platforms\n* it includes tweaks for increasing the costs involved in the construction of [[Field-programmable gate array|dedicated hardware]] to attack the algorithm\n* it balances resistance against [[side-channel attack|side-channel threats]] and attacks relying on cheaper (and, hence, slower) [[data storage device|storage devices]]\n* Lyra2 is released under [[public domain]], and provides two main extensions:<ref name=\"lyra2RefGuide\">{{Cite web|url=https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Lyra2-v3.pdf|title=The Lyra2 reference guide|last=Simplicio Jr|first=Marcos A.|last2=Almeida|first2=Leonardo C.|last3=Andrade|first3=Ewerton R.|last4=Santos|first4=Paulo C.|last5=Barreto|first5=Paulo S.

M.|website=PHC|publisher=The Password Hashing Competition}}</ref>\n* Lyra2-\u03b4, gives the user better control over the algorithm's bandwidth usage\n* Lyra2''p'', takes advantage of parallelism capabilities on the legitimate user's platform\nThis algorithm enables parameterization in terms of:<ref name=\"lyra2RefGuide\"/>\n* execution time (time cost <math>T</math>)\n* memory required (number of rows <math>R</math>, and number of columns <math>C</math>)\n* degree of parallelism (number of [[Thread (computing)|threads]] <math>p</math>)\n* underlying permutation function (can be seen as the main cryptographic primitive)\n* number of blocks used by the underlying permutation function (''bitrate'')\n* number of rounds performed for the underlying permutation function (<math>\\rho</math>)\n* number of bits to be used in rotations (<math>\\omega</math>)\n* output length (<math>\\kappa</math>)\n\n==Strengths ==\n\nAccording to <ref name=\"lyra2ToC\"/><ref name=\"lyra2RefGuide\"/>, the main strengths of the algorithm are:\n\n*High resistance against processing-memory tradeoffs: estimated processing costs of [[Time/memory/data tradeoff attack|attacks with low memory usage]] involve a factor that grows exponentially with time cost due to recomputations\n*Memory and time costs can be decoupled, allowing the resources' usage to be fine-tuned\n*Fast due to use of reduced-round sponge function in the algorithm's core\n*Can provide outputs of any desired length, behaving as a [[Key derivation function|Key Derivation Function]] (KDF)\n*Design combines resistance to [[side-channel attack]]s (during the whole Setup phase) and to attacks involving cheap (hence, low-speed) [[Computer data storage|memory devices]], aiming to balance such conflicting requirements\n*Considers a wide range of configurations for protecting against attacking platforms while optimizing execution on legitimate platform, such as:\n**Support for parallelism, for [[Multi-core processor|multicore platforms]], without giving much advantage to [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]-based attacks\n**Capability of using different underlying sponge functions depending on the target platform (e.g., [[BLAKE2|Blake2b]] for software implementations; [[Keccak]] for hardware implementations; BlaMka for additional resistance against hardware platforms; etc.)\n**Ability to raise the algorithm's memory bandwidth usage (note: the original specification is expected to max out the bandwidth in current machines, but feature may be useful for future hardware)\n\n==Design==\nAs any PHS, Lyra2 takes as input a [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] and a [[password]], creating a [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] output that can then be used as key material for cryptographic algorithms or as an [[authentication protocol|authentication]] string.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-108/sp800-108.pdf|title=Recommendation for Key Derivation Using Pseudorandom Functions (Revised)|last=Chen|first=Lily|website=Computer Security|publisher=NIST|doi=10.6028/NIST.SP.800-108|year=2009}}</ref>{{not in citation given|date=December 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nInternally, the scheme's memory is organized as a matrix that is expected to remain in memory during the whole password hashing process: since its cells are iteratively read and written, discarding a cell for saving memory leads to the need of recomputing it whenever it is accessed once again, until the point it was last modified.<ref name=\"lyra2ToC\"/>\n\nThe construction and visitation of the matrix is done using a stateful combination of the absorbing, squeezing and duplexing operations of the underlying [[Sponge function|sponge]] (i.e., its internal state is never reset to zero), ensuring the sequential nature of the whole process.\n\nAlso, the number of times the matrix's cells are revisited after initialization is defined by the user, allowing Lyra2's execution time to be fine-tuned according to the target platform's resources.<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\n# *** Functions/symbols ***\n#

name=\"lyra2RefGuide\"/>, the main strenghts of the algorithm are:\n\n*High resistance against processing-memory tradeoffs: estimated processing costs of [[Time/memory/data tradeoff attack|attacks with low memory usage]] involve a factor that grows exponentially with time cost due to recomputations\n*Memory and time costs can be decoupled, allowing the resources' usage to be fine-tuned\n*Fast due to use of reduced-round sponge function in the algorithm's core\n*Can provide outputs of any desired length, behaving as a [[Key derivation function|Key Derivation Function]] (KDF)\n*Design combines resistance to [[side-channel attack]]s (during the whole Setup phase) and to attacks involving cheap (hence, low-speed) [[Computer data storage|memory devices]], aiming to balance such conflicting requirements\n*Considers a wide range of configurations for protecting against attacking platforms while optimizing execution on legitimate platform, such as:\n**Support for parallelism, for [[Multi-core processor|multicore platforms]], without giving much advantage to [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]-based attacks\n**Capability of using different underlying sponge functions depending on the target platform (e.g., [[BLAKE2|Blake2b]] for software implementations; [[Keccak]] for hardware implementations; BlaMka for additional resistance against hardware platforms; etc.)\n**Ability to raise the algorithm's memory bandwidth usage (note: the original specification is expected to max out the bandwidth in current machines, but feature may be useful for future hardware)\n\n==Design==\nAs any PHS, Lyra2 takes as input a [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] and a [[password]], creating a [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] output that can then be used as key material for cryptographic algorithms or as an [[authentication protocol|authentication]] string.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-108/sp800-108.pdf|title=Recommendation

given|date=December 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nInternally, the scheme's memory is organized as a matrix that is expected to remain in memory during the whole password hashing process: since its cells are iteratively read and written, discarding a cell for saving memory leads to the need of recomputing it whenever it is accessed once again, until the point it was last modified.<ref name=\"lyra2ToC\"/>\n\nThe construction and visitation of the matrix is done using a stateful combination of the absorbing, squeezing and duplexing operations of the underlying [[Sponge function|sponge]] (i.e., its internal state is never reset to zero), ensuring the sequential nature of the whole process.\n\nAlso, the number of times the matrix's cells are revisited after initialization is defined by the user, allowing Lyra2's execution time to be fine-tuned according to the target platform's resources.<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\n# *** Functions/symbols ***\n#

It began broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 1, 1997, in association with MediaNet (formerly Softx) and Shopro, stands for Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions Co., Ltd. (formerly Shogakukan Productions Co., Ltd.). The show's central protagonist is [[Ash Ketchum]], a ten-year-old aspiring \"Pok\u00e9mon master\", who participates in competitions involving battles with creatures called [[List of Pok\u00e9mon|Pok\u00e9mon]] in the fictional regions of Kanto, the Orange Islands, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos, and attends a school on Melemele Island in the Alola region which teaches classes about Pok\u00e9mon. Ash is usually joined by his electric mouse partner [[Pikachu]], and a regularly changing line-up of human friends. These friends are usually Pok\u00e9mon trainers, such as [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]], [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]], Tracey Sketchit, May, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Serena, Clemont, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, and Sophocles, though some of the friends Ash has adventures with, such as May's brother Max, and Clemont's sister Bonnie, are too young to raise and train Pok\u00e9mon of their own.\n\nRecurring antagonists of Ash and his friends throughout the show are the frequently comedic thieves from Team Rocket, made up of the humans Jessie and James, a talking [[Meowth]], and later, a Wobbuffet.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

Koharu's aloofness appears to stem from her own uncertainty of what goals she wants to pursue, and she is bothered by her classmates assuming she will follow her father's footsteps and become a Pok\u00e9mon researcher, and that she must be a good battler.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James. Upon hearing that the Alolan Meowth was now working with Team Rocket later owned by their secretary Matori, he became disappointed to hear when he translated its language about its main reason to stay at their headquarters.\n*;{{nihongo|Wobbuffet|\u30bd-\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9|Sonansu}}\n:''Voiced by'': Y\u016bji Ueda (Japanese), Kayzie Rogers (EP146-XY140; English) & Erica Schroeder (SM003-present; English)\n: Wobbuffet is used occasionally for battles, and now he joins Team Rocket.

His goal is to liberate all Pok\u00e9mon from trainers and to rule Unova. He debuted in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", where he was seen briefly contacting Colress via a hologram communicator. He and Colress discussed the current status of the Pok\u00e9mon control experiment, and when Ash, his friends, and Looker approached Team Plasma's laboratory, Ghetsis ordered Colress to turn the experimental Pok\u00e9mon loose on them. He appeared again, this time in person, in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\". He was seen contacting Colress for an update on his Pok\u00e9mon control experiment. Later, Ghetsis spoke to several Team Plasma Grunts, who were spying on the excavations made at the White Ruins as well as looking for N and conducting the mysterious \"Project G\" and \"Project F\". Ghetsis reappeared in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\", where he was seen discussing his plans with Colress and Aldith. He was also seen in flashbacks to N's past, in which he raised N alongside Anthea and Concordia and wild Pok\u00e9mon. In a later flashback, a ceremony he led in N's Castle involving N and the Seven Sages was interrupted by Reshiram, infuriating him. In \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", Ghetsis successfully summoned Reshiram and, with the help of Colress's machine, took control of it. Despite turning it on his enemies, however, he lost control of Reshiram when Colress's machine was destroyed. Ultimately, he was arrested by Looker along with the rest of his followers.\n*;{{nihongo|N|\u30a8\u30cc|Enu}}\n:''Voiced by'': [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]] (Japanese), Nicholas DiMichele (English)\n:Unlike the games, N is not a villain, but an ally to Ash and his friends. Like his game counterpart, N can hear the inner voices of Pok\u00e9mon and believes that humans are using them for their own gain. However, he is not part of Team Plasma, but rather a defected member; Ghetsis raised him along with Anthea and Concordia, making them believe Pok\u00e9mon cannot be equals with humans unless they are released from all Pok\u00e9 Balls. A short time before the present,{{clarify|date=November 2018}}{{episode needed|date=November 2018}} N was about to be crowned King of Team Plasma in Ghetsis' plan to use N's pure-hearted desire to save Pok\u00e9mon to summon Reshiram and enslave it.

His goal is to discover the true way to draw out the strength of Pok\u00e9mon. Colress debuts in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", conducting experiments with wild Pok\u00e9mon with electromagnetic waves in an attempt to bring out their true strength. He plants one of his controlling devices on Ash's Pikachu, forcing him to fight his Trainer. However, Ash's encouragement allows Pikachu to fight against the EM waves, eventually causing the device to break and freeing Pikachu. Before he can gather further data, Team Rocket shows up, using one of their miniature robots to steal Colress's research data from his computer. Colress appears again in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where it was revealed that he had upgraded his Pok\u00e9mon-controlling machine with his remaining research data. The machine now fires a narrow energy beam which instantly brings any Pok\u00e9mon it hits under Team Plasma's control. Using this machine, Colress takes control of a Haxorus and Iris's Dragonite. A Shadow Ball from Aldith's Liepard accidentally hits the machine, breaking it and freeing Haxorus and Dragonite from his control. Colress and the Plasma Grunts retreat. Colress appears briefly in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\" with Aldith, discussing Team Plasma's plans with Ghetsis on a videophone call. Colress appears again in \"Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!\", where he refuses Meowth's attempt to recruit him to Team Rocket. However, he offers to allow Meowth to participate in an experiment to increase his strength. Colress controls Meowth's mind with the experiment, but Jessie and James snap him out of it before escaping. Later, Colress is seen with his Grunts reporting to Ghetsis, who revealed information about the Light Stone to them. In \"Ash and N: A Clash of Ideals!\", Colress appears with the rest of Team Plasma to commence their operation at the White Ruins. While Aldith, Barret and many other Grunts ambush the workers at the site, Colress uses his perfected machine to seize control of the workers' Pok\u00e9mon and turn them on their Trainers. In \"Team Plasma and the Awakening Ceremony!\", he also takes control of Pikachu again, forcing N to surrender the Light Stone to Team Plasma in exchange for Ash's safety. He appears again in \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", aiding Ghetsis in taking control of the awakened Reshiram. When Ash and Pikachu try to stop him, he uses his machine on Pikachu yet again. However, this time Pikachu fights against its control, and - together with Reshiram - destroy Colress's machine once and for all, thus freeing the controlled Pok\u00e9mon. Colress and the other Team Plasma members are later arrested by Looker, thus bringing the team down.\n*;{{nihongo|Aldith|\u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30fc|Anj\u012b|Angie}}\n:''Voiced by'': [[Akeno Watanabe]] (Japanese), Lori Gardner (English)\n:A member of Team Plasma, Aldith first appears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", observing Colress's work with controlling wild Pok\u00e9mon with radio waves. During the tests, she experiences some friction with the scientist in terms of their ultimate goals; while Aldith expected the results of the experiment to help Team Plasma's takeover of Unova, Colress was merely interested in unlocking the true strength of Pok\u00e9mon. When Looker, Ash and his friends arrive, she orders her fellow grunts to hold them off until Colress's test subjects are battle-ready, at which point she leads a retreat to lure her foes into their observatory base. Aldith commands Colress's brainwashed wild Pok\u00e9mon against the intruders, as well as Pikachu when Colress attaches a transmitter to its head. When Pikachu manages to overcome the brainwashing, Aldith reminds Colress about the situation. After Team Rocket's interference destroys Colress's machine, freeing the mind-controlled Pok\u00e9mon, Aldith joins her teammates in retreat, using a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the observatory and get rid of the remaining evidence of their activity. She reappears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where once again monitors a mind-controlling experiment of Colress, this time on a Haxorus. When Team Rocket shows up in an attempt to steal Colress's mind-controlling device, a battle starts, where a Shadow Ball from Aldith's Liepard misses its target and accidentally hits the machine, freeing the controlled Pok\u00e9mon and forcing Team Plasma to retreat. Aldith has a short appearance in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\", communicating with Ghetsis alongside Colress. She appears in \"Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!\" as part of Colress's security force at his latest lab.

He is also serious when it goes to old traditions, especially with the Z-Ring and the Z-Crystals. When he first sees Ash with the Z-Ring, he shows signs of disapproval, since Ash gets it without completing the challenges. When Ash misplaces a Z-Crystal, he becomes enraged and threatens to send his Turtonator at him. It seems that Kiawe doesn't know how to interact with Water-type Pok\u00e9mon, as he admits that he wasn't sure of how to deal with Popplio at first, instead having his sister play with it instead. In \"When Regions Collide!\", Kiawe is shown to be very competitive when he challenges Brock into a real Gym battle at the Cerulean City Gym by using his Turtonator against his Steelix.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat. Go tends to yell \"Go!\" when sending out his Pok\u00e9mon or throwing Pok\u00e9 Balls.\n*;{{nihongo|Koharu|\u30b3\u30cf\u30eb|Koharu}}\n:''Japanese voice'': [[Kana Hanazawa]]\n: Koharu is overly cautious and takes a realistic approach to life. She finds Go's confidence and big ideas to be irritating, and often reminds her friend to mind his manners. She appears distant and indifferent to others, as seen when she tends to ignore Ash. Koharu's aloofness appears to stem from her own uncertainty of what goals she wants to pursue, and she is bothered by her classmates assuming she will follow her father's footsteps and become a Pok\u00e9mon researcher, and that she must be a good battler. After a conversation with her mother and working together with Yamper to defeat an attacking Gengar, Koharu appears to grow closer to her Pok\u00e9mon and become more certain of herself.\n\n==Rivals==\n\n*;{{nihongo|Gary Oak|[[:ja:\u30aa\u30fc\u30ad\u30c9\u30fb\u30b7\u30b2\u30eb|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ad\u30c9\u30fb\u30b7\u30b2\u30eb]]|\u014ckido Shigeru|Shigeru \u014ckido}}\n:''Japanese voice'': [[Yuko Kobayashi]] \n:''English voice'': [[James Carter Cathcart]]\n:''Korean voice'': Lee Seon-Ju \n:Gary Oak is Ash's very first rival.

Unlike Ash's previous rivals, Paul is a grumpy and serious trainer whose only concern towards Pok\u00e9mon is their ability to act in battle and who believes that forming bonds with Pok\u00e9mon dilutes their potential, and is thereby seen by many characters for being the complete opposite of Ash. His harsh training style, competitive behavior, and desire to be strong derives from his resentment toward his older brother, Reggie, who had been an accomplished trainer until he lost to Pyramid King Brandon, causing him to quit Pok\u00e9mon training to become a breeder.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James. Upon hearing that the Alolan Meowth was now working with Team Rocket later owned by their secretary Matori, he became disappointed to hear when he translated its language about its main reason to stay at their headquarters.\n*;{{nihongo|Wobbuffet|\u30bd-\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9|Sonansu}}\n:''Voiced by'': Y\u016bji Ueda (Japanese), Kayzie Rogers (EP146-XY140; English) & Erica Schroeder (SM003-present; English)\n: Wobbuffet is used occasionally for battles, and now he joins Team Rocket.

A short time before the present,{{clarify|date=November 2018}}{{episode needed|date=November 2018}} N was about to be crowned King of Team Plasma in Ghetsis' plan to use N's pure-hearted desire to save Pok\u00e9mon to summon Reshiram and enslave it. However, the attempt backfired, leaving Team Plasma's castle destroyed by Fusion Flare. N, along with Anthea and Concordia flee to a secluded abandoned castle, where they spend their time tending to mistreated Pok\u00e9mon.\n*;{{nihongo|Colress|\u30a2\u30af\u30ed\u30de|Akuroma|Achroma}}\n:''Voiced by'': [[Hiroki T\u014dchi]] (Japanese), Eli James (English)\n:Colress is a Pok\u00e9mon researcher and the second boss of Team Plasma, appointed by Ghetsis. His goal is to discover the true way to draw out the strength of Pok\u00e9mon. Colress debuts in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", conducting experiments with wild Pok\u00e9mon with electromagnetic waves in an attempt to bring out their true strength. He plants one of his controlling devices on Ash's Pikachu, forcing him to fight his Trainer. However, Ash's encouragement allows Pikachu to fight against the EM waves, eventually causing the device to break and freeing Pikachu. Before he can gather further data, Team Rocket shows up, using one of their miniature robots to steal Colress's research data from his computer. Colress appears again in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where it was revealed that he had upgraded his Pok\u00e9mon-controlling machine with his remaining research data. The machine now fires a narrow energy beam which instantly brings any Pok\u00e9mon it hits under Team Plasma's control. Using this machine, Colress takes control of a Haxorus and Iris's Dragonite. A Shadow Ball from Aldith's Liepard accidentally hits the machine, breaking it and freeing Haxorus and Dragonite from his control. Colress and the Plasma Grunts retreat. Colress appears briefly in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\" with Aldith, discussing Team Plasma's plans with Ghetsis on a videophone call. Colress appears again in \"Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!\", where he refuses Meowth's attempt to recruit him to Team Rocket. However, he offers to allow Meowth to participate in an experiment to increase his strength. Colress controls Meowth's mind with the experiment, but Jessie and James snap him out of it before escaping. Later, Colress is seen with his Grunts reporting to Ghetsis, who revealed information about the Light Stone to them. In \"Ash and N: A Clash of Ideals!\", Colress appears with the rest of Team Plasma to commence their operation at the White Ruins. While Aldith, Barret and many other Grunts ambush the workers at the site, Colress uses his perfected machine to seize control of the workers' Pok\u00e9mon and turn them on their Trainers. In \"Team Plasma and the Awakening Ceremony!\", he also takes control of Pikachu again, forcing N to surrender the Light Stone to Team Plasma in exchange for Ash's safety. He appears again in \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", aiding Ghetsis in taking control of the awakened Reshiram. When Ash and Pikachu try to stop him, he uses his machine on Pikachu yet again. However, this time Pikachu fights against its control, and - together with Reshiram - destroy Colress's machine once and for all, thus freeing the controlled Pok\u00e9mon. Colress and the other Team Plasma members are later arrested by Looker, thus bringing the team down.\n*;{{nihongo|Aldith|\u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30fc|Anj\u012b|Angie}}\n:''Voiced by'': [[Akeno Watanabe]] (Japanese), Lori Gardner (English)\n:A member of Team Plasma, Aldith first appears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", observing Colress's work with controlling wild Pok\u00e9mon with radio waves. During the tests, she experiences some friction with the scientist in terms of their ultimate goals; while Aldith expected the results of the experiment to help Team Plasma's takeover of Unova, Colress was merely interested in unlocking the true strength of Pok\u00e9mon. When Looker, Ash and his friends arrive, she orders her fellow grunts to hold them off until Colress's test subjects are battle-ready, at which point she leads a retreat to lure her foes into their observatory base. Aldith commands Colress's brainwashed wild Pok\u00e9mon against the intruders, as well as Pikachu when Colress attaches a transmitter to its head. When Pikachu manages to overcome the brainwashing, Aldith reminds Colress about the situation. After Team Rocket's interference destroys Colress's machine, freeing the mind-controlled Pok\u00e9mon, Aldith joins her teammates in retreat, using a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the observatory and get rid of the remaining evidence of their activity. She reappears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where once again monitors a mind-controlling experiment of Colress, this time on a Haxorus. When Team Rocket shows up in an attempt to steal Colress's mind-controlling device, a battle starts, where a Shadow Ball from Aldith's Liepard misses its target and accidentally hits the machine, freeing the controlled Pok\u00e9mon and forcing Team Plasma to retreat. Aldith has a short appearance in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\", communicating with Ghetsis alongside Colress. She appears in \"Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!\" as part of Colress's security force at his latest lab. When Team Rocket appears, she, along with Barret and several other Grunts, chase the trio out into the woods. There, they are drawn into a trap and did not escape for some time.

He reappears in \"Meeting at Terminus Cave!\", again coordinating Team Flare's attacks on Squishy and the study of Zygarde's powers. In \"A Meeting of Two Journeys!\", Xerosic travels to a remote island to test a prototype weapon that harnesses the energy of the Zygarde Cores and Mega Evolution, causing the trees on the island to bloom red flowers. Following Z2's capture in \"An Explosive Operation!\", Xerosic is often seen monitoring Z2 and performing experiments on it, using the Giant Rock that Lysandre captures in \"Mega Evolution Special III\". In \"Down to the Fiery Finish!\", he uses Team Flare's Mega Evolution energy weapon to control Z2, causing it to unleash massive roots throughout Lumiose City. During the crisis, Xerosic remains in the Lumiose Gym, overseeing Team Flare's operation, and eventually succeeds in controlling Squishy as well.

[[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963\u20131995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\n{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition.

Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.\n\nHowever, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].<ref name=\"Dalry\">Dalrymple, Theodore.

of 11 local government districts was established on 1 April 2015, as a result of the [[reform of local government in Northern Ireland|reform process]] that started in 2005.\n\nThe previous pattern of local government in Northern Ireland, with 26 councils, was established in 1973 by the [[Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971]] and the [[Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972]] to replace the previous system established by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]. The system was based on the recommendations of the Macrory Report, of June 1970, which presupposed the continued existence of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] to act as a regional-level authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/macrory.htm#9|title=Report of the Review Body on Local Government in Northern Ireland 1970|date=June 1970|work=CAIN Web Service \u2013 Conflict and Politics in Northern Ireland (University of Ulster)|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1921 to 1973, Northern Ireland was divided into six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|administrative counties]] (subdivided into [[List of rural and urban districts in Northern Ireland|urban and rural district]]s) and two [[county borough]]s. The counties and county boroughs continue to exist for the purposes of [[Lord Lieutenant|lieutenancy]] and [[Shrievalty#Northern Ireland|shrievalty]].<ref>The Northern Ireland (Lieutenancy) Order 1975 (S.I. 1975 No.156)</ref> This system, with the abolition of rural districts, remains the model for local government in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. (See also [[List of rural and urban districts in Northern Ireland]] for more details)\n\n==Elections==\nCouncillors are elected for a four-year term of office under the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system. Elections were last held on May 2nd, 2019. To qualify for election, a councillor candidate must be:\n* at least 18 years of age, and\n* a [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or [[European Union]] citizen\nIn addition, he or she must either:\n* be a local elector for the district, or\n* have, during the whole of the 12-month period prior to the election, either owned or occupied land in the district, or else resided or worked in the district\n\n== Combinations ==\nThe districts are combined for various purposes.\n\n=== Eurostat NUTS level 3 ===\nIn the [[Eurostat]] [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS), Northern Ireland is divided into five parts at level 3\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

Their functions include [[urban planning|planning]], [[Recycling in Northern Ireland|waste and recycling services]], leisure and community services, building control and local economic and cultural development.

of 11 local government districts was established on 1 April 2015, as a result of the [[reform of local government in Northern Ireland|reform process]] that started in 2005.\n\nThe previous pattern of local government in Northern Ireland, with 26 councils, was established in 1973 by the [[Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971]] and the [[Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972]] to replace the previous system established by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]. The system was based on the recommendations of the Macrory Report, of June 1970, which presupposed the continued existence of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] to act as a regional-level authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/macrory.htm#9|title=Report of the Review Body on Local Government in Northern Ireland 1970|date=June 1970|work=CAIN Web Service \u2013 Conflict and Politics in Northern Ireland (University of Ulster)|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationary Office|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1921 to 1973, Northern Ireland was divided into six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|administrative counties]] (subdivided into [[List of rural and urban districts in Northern Ireland|urban and rural district]]s) and two [[county borough]]s. The counties and county boroughs continue to exist for the purposes of [[Lord Lieutenant|lieutenancy]] and [[Shrievalty#Northern Ireland|shrievalty]].<ref>The Northern Ireland (Lieutenancy) Order 1975 (S.I. 1975 No.156)</ref> This system, with the abolition of rural districts, remains the model for local government in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. (See also [[List of rural and urban districts in Northern Ireland]] for more details)\n\n==Elections==\nCouncillors are elected for a four-year term of office under the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system. Elections were last held on May 2nd, 2019. To qualify for election, a councillor candidate must be:\n* at least 18 years of age, and\n* a [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or [[European Union]] citizen\nIn addition, he or she must either:\n* be a local elector for the district, or\n* have, during the whole of the 12-month period prior to the election, either owned or occupied land in the district, or else resided or worked in the district\n\n== Combinations ==\nThe districts are combined for various purposes.\n\n=== Eurostat NUTS level 3 ===\nIn the [[Eurostat]] [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS), Northern Ireland is divided into five parts at level 3\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!
