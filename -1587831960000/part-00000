droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such as bronchoscopy. \n|-\n|[[Airborne transmission]]\n|Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue {5 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]] or smaller in size} of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Microorganisms transmitted by airborne transmission include ''[[Legionella]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and the [[rubeola]] and [[varicella]] viruses.\n|-\n|Common vehicle transmission\n|This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items, such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.\n|-\n|[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector borne transmission]]\n|This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms.\n|}\n\nContact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Routes of contact transmission\n!Route\n!Description\n|-\n|Direct-contact transmission\n|This involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other [[health care|patient-care]] activities that require direct personal contact. Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two patients, with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.\n|-\n|Indirect-contact transmission\n|This involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments, [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s, or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients. In addition, the improper use of saline flush syringes, vials, and bags has been implicated in disease transmission in the US, even when healthcare workers had access to gloves, disposable needles, intravenous devices, and flushes.<ref name=salineflush>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain SK, Persaud D, Perl TM, etal |title=Nosocomial malaria and saline flush |journal=Emerging Infect.

An adaptation of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment policy causes poor-performing hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that are able to avoid HAIs can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the program's first 2 years, complication rates fell by 15.26 percent across all hospital-acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in 2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26-percent decline translates into more than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, [[sepsis]] and other severe infections, and [[pneumonia]] and other lung infections. If similar results could be achieved nationwide, the Medicare program would save an estimated $1.3 billion over 2 years, while the health care system as a whole would save $5.3 billion.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/statewide-all-payer-financial-incentives-significantly-reduce-hospital-acquired-conditions |title=Statewide, All-Payer Financial Incentives Significantly Reduce Hospital-Acquired Conditions in Maryland Hospitals |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}</ref>\n\nHospitals have sanitation protocols regarding [[scrubs (clothing)|uniforms]], equipment [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], washing, and other preventive measures.

Furthermore, patients are often prescribed antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs to help treat illness; this may increase the [[natural selection|selection pressure]] for the emergence of resistant strains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kol\u00e1r|first=M.|last2=Urb\u00e1nek|first2=K.|last3=L\u00e1tal|first3=T.|date=May 2001|title=Antibiotic selective pressure and development of bacterial resistance|journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents|volume=17|issue=5|pages=357\u2013363|issn=0924-8579|pmid=11337221|doi=10.1016/S0924-8579(01)00317-X}}</ref>\n\n===Sterilization===\nSterilization goes further than just sanitizing. It kills all microorganisms on equipment and surfaces through exposure to chemicals, ionizing radiation, dry heat, or steam under pressure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gibraltarlabsinc.com/the-different-methods-of-sterilizing-medical-equipment/|title=The Different Methods of Sterilizing Medical Equipment|date=2013-05-31|website=Gibraltar Laboratories|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===Isolation===\n{{Main article|Isolation (health care)}}\nIsolation is the implementation of isolating precautions designed to prevent transmission of microorganisms by common routes in hospitals. (See [[Universal precautions]] and [[Transmission-based precautions]].) Because agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.\n\n===Handwashing===\n[[Handwashing]] frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce the risks of transmitting [[skin flora|skin microorganism]]s from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with [[blood]], [[body fluid]]s, [[secretion]]s, [[excretion]]s, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions. \nThe spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is connected with health care workers' hand contamination in almost 40% of cases, and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.<ref>World Alliance for patient safety. WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. http://www.who.int/rpc/guidelines/9789241597906/en/. 2009</ref>\nTwo categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers' hands: transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 x 10<sup>4</sup> \u2013 4.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>. The microbes comprising the resident flora are: ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'', ''S. hominis'', and ''Microccocus'', ''Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dermobacterium'', and ''Pitosporum'' spp., while transient organisms are ''S. aureus'', and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', and ''Acinetobacter, Enterobacter'' and ''Candida'' spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster application compared to correct hand-washing.<ref>Hugonnet S, Perneger TV, Pittet D. Alcohol based hand rub improves compliance with hand hygiene in intensive care units. Arch Intern med 2002; 162: 1037-1043.</ref>\n\nImproving patient hand washing has also been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling waste such as tissues.  By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and providing santizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly able to reduce infection rates.  A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and \"S. aureus\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haverstick, Stacy|author2=Goodrich, Cara|author3=Freeman, Regi|author4=James, Shandra|author5=Kullar, Rajkiran|author6=Ahrens, Melissa|date=June 2017|title=Patients' Hand Washing and Reducing Hospital-Acquired Infection|journal=Critical Care Nurse|volume=37|issue=3|pages=e1\u2013e8|url=http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/37/3/e1.abstract|doi=10.4037/ccn2017694|pmid=28572111|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAll visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately control the spread of infections.

Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of [[bloodborne pathogen]] infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=16265&p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;Needlestick and Other Sharps Injuries; Final Rule. - 66:5317-5325 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref> Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a [[fomite]] can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.\n\nWearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing due to the possibility of contamination when gloves are replaced, or by damage to the glove. Doctors wearing the same gloves for multiple patient operations presents an infection control hazard.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bacteria Can Persist on Gloves, Transfer to Surfaces|first=Neil|last=Osterweil|date=June 19, 2016|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/865048|work=[[Medscape]]}}</ref>\n\n===Surface sanitation===\nSanitizing surfaces is part of nosocomial infection in health care environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as [[NAV-CO2|Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems]] have been effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza agents. Use of [[hydrogen peroxide]] vapor has been clinically proven to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition.

droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such as bronchoscopy. \n|-\n|[[Airborne transmission]]\n|Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue {5 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]] or smaller in size} of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Microorganisms transmitted by airborne transmission include ''[[Legionella]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and the [[rubeola]] and [[varicella]] viruses.\n|-\n|Common vehicle transmission\n|This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items, such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.\n|-\n|[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector borne transmission]]\n|This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms.\n|}\n\nContact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Routes of contact transmission\n!Route\n!Description\n|-\n|Direct-contact transmission\n|This involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other [[health care|patient-care]] activities that require direct personal contact. Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two patients, with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.\n|-\n|Indirect-contact transmission\n|This involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments, [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s, or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients.

An adaptation of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment policy causes poor-performing hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that are able to avoid HAIs can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the program's first 2 years, complication rates fell by 15.26 percent across all hospital-acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in 2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26-percent decline translates into more than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, [[sepsis]] and other severe infections, and [[pneumonia]] and other lung infections.

(See [[Universal precautions]] and [[Transmission-based precautions]].) Because agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.\n\n===Handwashing===\n[[Handwashing]] frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce the risks of transmitting [[skin flora|skin microorganism]]s from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with [[blood]], [[body fluid]]s, [[secretion]]s, [[excretion]]s, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions. \nThe spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is connected with health care workers' hand contamination in almost 40% of cases, and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.<ref>World Alliance for patient safety. WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. http://www.who.int/rpc/guidelines/9789241597906/en/. 2009</ref>\nTwo categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers' hands: transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 x 10<sup>4</sup> \u2013 4.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>. The microbes comprising the resident flora are: ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'', ''S. hominis'', and ''Microccocus'', ''Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dermobacterium'', and ''Pitosporum'' spp., while transient organisms are ''S. aureus'', and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', and ''Acinetobacter, Enterobacter'' and ''Candida'' spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster application compared to correct hand-washing.<ref>Hugonnet S, Perneger TV, Pittet D. Alcohol based hand rub improves compliance with hand hygiene in intensive care units. Arch Intern med 2002; 162: 1037-1043.</ref>\n\nImproving patient hand washing has also been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling waste such as tissues.  By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and providing santizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly able to reduce infection rates.  A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and \"S. aureus\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haverstick, Stacy|author2=Goodrich, Cara|author3=Freeman, Regi|author4=James, Shandra|author5=Kullar, Rajkiran|author6=Ahrens, Melissa|date=June 2017|title=Patients' Hand Washing and Reducing Hospital-Acquired Infection|journal=Critical Care Nurse|volume=37|issue=3|pages=e1\u2013e8|url=http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/37/3/e1.abstract|doi=10.4037/ccn2017694|pmid=28572111|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAll visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately control the spread of infections.

Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of [[bloodborne pathogen]] infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=16265&p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;Needlestick and Other Sharps Injuries; Final Rule. - 66:5317-5325 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref> Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a [[fomite]] can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.\n\nWearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing due to the possibility of contamination when gloves are replaced, or by damage to the glove. Doctors wearing the same gloves for multiple patient operations presents an infection control hazard.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bacteria Can Persist on Gloves, Transfer to Surfaces|first=Neil|last=Osterweil|date=June 19, 2016|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/865048|work=[[Medscape]]}}</ref>\n\n===Surface sanitation===\nSanitizing surfaces is part of nosocomial infection in health care environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as [[NAV-CO2|Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems]] have been effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza agents. Use of [[hydrogen peroxide]] vapor has been clinically proven to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition.

Despite their weakness at the point guard position, Bogues was left unprotected by the Bullets. On June 22, 1988 the Hornets selected him in the [[expansion draft]]. As Bogues settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], he established himself as an exceptional passer, a great [[steal (basketball)|stealer]], and one of the fastest players on the court.\n\nBogues spent ten years in Charlotte as the Hornets, led by [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]], became one of the NBA's most popular teams{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and a perennial playoff contender. Bogues was one of the most popular players in Hornets history. He is the Hornets' career leader in minutes played (19,768), assists (5,557), steals (1,067), turnovers (1,118), and assists per 48 minutes (13.5).\n\n===Later career===\nSix games into the [[1997\u201398 NBA season]], Bogues was traded, along with [[Tony Delk]], to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[B. J. Armstrong]]. Bogues played two seasons with the Warriors, and then signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Toronto Raptors]], where he would finish his career. Although he was later traded to the [[New York Knicks]] and then to [[Dallas Mavericks]], he did not play in a game for either team.\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics

The shortest player ever to play in the [[National Basketball Association]], the {{height|ft=5|in=3}} Bogues played [[point guard]] for four teams during his 14-season career in the NBA. Although best known for his ten seasons with the [[Charlotte Hornets]], Bogues also played for the [[Washington Bullets]], [[Golden State Warriors]], and [[Toronto Raptors]]. After his NBA career, he served as head coach of the now-defunct [[Charlotte Sting]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]].\n\n==Early life==\nBogues was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and grew up in the Lafayette Court housing projects.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdTkvnfrlvw|title=Muggsy Bogues Profile|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=July 16, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>  He was raised by his mother after his father went to prison.

He was a teammate of future NBA players [[David Wingate (basketball)|David Wingate]] (graduating class ahead of him), [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1964)|Reggie Williams]] and [[Reggie Lewis]] (both in his graduating class). The 1981\u201382 Dunbar Poets finished the season at 29\u20130 during Bogues' junior season and finished 31\u20130 during his senior season, and were ranked first in the nation by ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slamonline.com/online/high-school/2007/09/dunbar-high-brick-house/|title=Dunbar High: Brick House|website=Slamonline.com|date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==College==\n[[File:Tyrone Bogues 1985 Wake Forest.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Bogues making a layup for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons]]\n\nHe played four years at [[Wake Forest University]], averaging 11.3 points, 8.4 assists and 3.1 steals per game in his junior year. He followed with a senior campaign in which he averaged 14.8 points, 9.5 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 2.4 steals per game. When his collegiate career ended, he was the ACC career leader in steals and assists.\n\nBogues played for the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA national team]] in the [[1986 FIBA World Championship]] and won the gold medal.<ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1986.html 1986 USA Basketball] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814002049/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1986.html |date=August 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==NBA career==\nAfter a brief stint playing for the [[Rhode Island Gulls]] in the [[United States Basketball League|USBL]], Bogues was drafted 12th overall in the [[1987 NBA draft]] by the [[Washington Bullets]], and was part of a talent-laden draft class that also included [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], [[Reggie Miller]], [[Scottie Pippen]], and [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]]. In his rookie year, Bogues was a teammate of [[Manute Bol]] who stood {{height|ft=7|in=7}} tall. They were the tallest and shortest players in NBA history at the time, with {{convert|28|in|cm}} difference between them. Bol and Bogues appeared on three magazine covers together.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBogues blocked 39 shots as a professional player, including one by {{height|ft=7}} tall [[Patrick Ewing]], on April 14, 1993. Bogues reportedly had a {{convert|44|in|cm|adj=on}} [[vertical leap]], but his hands were too small to hold on to a ball to dunk one-handed.<ref>[http://classicsportsfan.com/muggsy-bogues-dunk-did-it-ever-happen/ \"Muggsy Bogues Dunk : Did It Ever Happen?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108055231/http://classicsportsfan.com/muggsy-bogues-dunk-did-it-ever-happen/ |date=2016-01-08 }}.

Despite their weakness at the point guard position, Bogues was left unprotected by the Bullets. On June 22, 1988 the Hornets selected him in the [[expansion draft]]. As Bogues settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], he established himself as an exceptional passer, a great [[steal (basketball)|stealer]], and one of the fastest players on the court.\n\nBogues spent ten years in Charlotte as the Hornets, led by [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]], became one of the NBA's most popular teams{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and a perennial playoff contender. Bogues was one of the most popular players in Hornets history. He is the Hornets' career leader in minutes played (19,768), assists (5,557), steals (1,067), turnovers (1,118), and assists per 48 minutes (13.5).\n\n===Later career===\nSix games into the [[1997\u201398 NBA season]], Bogues was traded, along with [[Tony Delk]], to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[B. J. Armstrong]]. Bogues played two seasons with the Warriors, and then signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Toronto Raptors]], where he would finish his career. Although he was later traded to the [[New York Knicks]] and then to [[Dallas Mavericks]], he did not play in a game for either team.\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics
