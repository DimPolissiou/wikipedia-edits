The Motorola APCOR could transmit voice and [[EKG]] simultaneously and was battery operated. There were three or more versions of the Motorola APCOR, the first was similar to the [[Biophone]], the second was significantly smaller and was white.

Motorola mistakenly thought that the [[LA County Fire Department]]'s code was for the radios to be orange, and created an orange radio for its first version. The radio had the [[Motorola]] MX 300 embedded inside of the radio and had 10 MED channels. It was slightly ahead of the [[Biophone]], in portability, but both had the same specifications. The APCOR became very popular during the late '70s and 1980s and was widely adopted by fire departments and emergency medical services agencies across the United States.

In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|545}} The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|303}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|85}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295f}}<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|55f}}\n\nThe world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or [[Overshoot (population)|population overshoot]]. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken \u2014 and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.<ref name=tj01/><ref name=bc01/><ref name=rd01/><ref name=ap01/>{{rp|148\u2013155}}\n \nA steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]]. An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].\n\n== Definition and vision ==\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]] \u2014 to such an extent that even his boldest critics recognize the prominence of his work.<ref name=ngr03/>{{rp|167}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|9}}\n\nHerman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy \u2014 something desirable by itself \u2014 maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14\u201319}}\n\nDaly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nIn the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ma01/>{{rp|84}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|83}}\n\n== Historical background ==\nFor centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].\n\n=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===\n{{main|Classical economics}}\n{{see also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}\nFrom [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|3}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295}}\n\n=== Adam Smith's concept ===\n{{main|Adam Smith}}\n{{see also|Invisible hand}}\n{{further|The Wealth of Nations}}\n[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]\n[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the [[enlightened self-interest]] of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|349f, 533f}}\n\nSmith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|59\u201368}}\n\nSmith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:\n\n{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}}}\n\nAccording to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, \"... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\n=== David Ricardo's concept ===\n{{Main|David Ricardo}}\n{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}\n{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}\n[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]\nIn the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade#Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|135f}}\n\nIn Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|6\u201310}}\n\nAccording to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers \u2013 Ricardo himself died in 1823 \u2013 directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|202f}}\n\nThe Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|88f}}\n\nRicardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).\n\n=== John Stuart Mill's concept ===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\n{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}\n{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]\nJohn Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|179}}\n\nA champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.<ref name=jsm02/> Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:\n\n{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...<ref name=jsm03/>{{rp|19}}}}\n\nMill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|16}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:\n\n{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592}}}}\n\nContrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not \"... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about \"... a very considerable improvement on our present condition.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by \u2014 instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592\u2013596}}\n\nHence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14f}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|79}}\n\n=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===\n{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}\nWhen the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:\n\n[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]\n{{anchor|Karl Marx}}\n* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of \"from each according to ability, to each according to need\" \u2014 that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Post-scarcity economy#Marxism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|57\u201365}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|218\u2013225}} <ref name=pb01/>{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that \"Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]].\"<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|52}}\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295\u2013299}} <ref name=rc01/>{{rp|55\u201357}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|156\u2013160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|121\u2013123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.<ref name=jb01/>{{rp|145\u2013148}}\n\nTaken together, it has been argued that \"... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics.\"<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has \nreintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).\n\n=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===\n{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}\n{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}\n{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}\n\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]\n[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.\n\nIn his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing \"bad attack of economic pessimism\" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' \u2014 avarice, exaction of interest, love of money \u2014 that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live \"wisely and agreeably and well.\" Mankind would finally have solved \"the economic problem,\" that is, the struggle for existence.<ref name=jmk01/><ref name=lp01/>{{rp|2, 11}}\n\nThe similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|3\u20136}}\n\nIn his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and \u2014 if population was not increasing rapidly \u2014 society would finally \"... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ...\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. \"I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work.\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|237}}\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===\nThe economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ===\n{{See also|Environmentalism#Post-war expansion}}\nAfter the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion \u2014 known today as the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]] \u2014 was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded \u2014 or later joined \u2014 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973\u201375 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].\n\nThroughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] \u2014 dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] \u2014 developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.<ref name=rc01/>{{rp|46f}} <ref name=mc01/>{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream.

Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution \u2014 like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.<ref name=kb01/><ref name=mc01/>{{rp|104}}\n* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).<ref name=ngr01/> In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ag01/>{{rp|13}} <ref name=kb02/>{{rp|164f}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013171}}\n* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis.

Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Mart\u00ednez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|308\u2013310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].\n\nWhen the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.<ref name=ir02/>{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.<ref name=ba01/><ref name=cs02/><ref name=gp01/>\n\n=== Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy ===\nSince the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.<ref name=hd01/><ref name=hd02/><ref name=hd03/>{{rp|117\u2013124}} <ref name=hd05/> He has also helped founding the ''Center for the Advancement of the Steady-State Economy'' (CASSE).<ref name=casse/> He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.<ref name=cr01/>\n\nAccording to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] \u2014 or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] \u2014 top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|146\u2013148}}\n\n[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]\nThe premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nDaly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may \u2014 within some practical limits \u2014 extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock \u2014 and not the Sun \u2014 that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|21f}}\n\n[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]\nDaly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.\n\nDaly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:\n\n{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point \u2014 the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|23}}}}\n\nFollowing the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:\n\n{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|36}}}}\n\nThis view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nIn Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that \"... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants\".<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.\n\n{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}\n[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]\nConsequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:\n\n* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.\n* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.\n* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).\n\nThe purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls \"a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity\" and providing \"the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|69}}\n\nAmong the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} \n<ref name=kb02/>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}\nResponding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: \"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\".<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...\n\n{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end \u2014 that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|370}}}}\n\nLater, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.<ref name=mr01/>{{rp|90f}} <ref name=mf01/>{{rp|105\u2013107}} <ref name=mb03/>{{rp|270}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=av01/>{{rp|37}}\n\n== Ecological reasons for a steady state economy ==\n=== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ===\n{{see also|Anthropocene|List of environmental issues|Planetary boundaries|Societal collapse}}\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Like any other planet, earth is finite]]\nThe world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the [[world economy]] far exceeds critical global limits to [[economic growth]] already.<ref name=dm01/> According to the [[Ecological footprint#Footprint measurements|ecological footprint measure]], earth's [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] \u2014 that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.<ref name=gfn01/><ref name=jw01/> In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.<ref name=welanth/> The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:\n\n;Overpopulation\nWorld population is [[Human overpopulation#Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population#Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].\n\n;Pollution and global warming\nAir pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many \u2014 if not all \u2014 parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability. Even worse, the [[Arctic methane emissions#Loss of permafrost|loss of Arctic permafrost]] may be triggering a [[Permafrost#Predicted rate of change in the Arctic|massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils]] in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, Earth's climate may transit from an [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|'icehouse' to a 'greenhouse' state]] for the first time in 34 million years.\n\nOne of the most common solutions to the [[climate crisis]] is transitioning to renewable energy, but it also has some environmental impacts.

Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to [[Human impact on the environment#Agricultural land loss and soil erosion|exceed soil creation rates]] by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of [[groundwater]] results in [[Water scarcity#Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts|water deficits]] in many countries.

The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, [[Global warming|climate change]], [[pollution]] and [[invasive species]]. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to [[governance]].\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.\n\n4.

This ultra-[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time \u2014 although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=do02/>{{rp|229}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013146}}\n\n=== The concept of Overdevelopment by Leopold Cohr ===\n{{main|Overdevelopment}}\nIn 1977 [[Leopold Kohr]] published a book named ''The Overdeveloped Nations: The Diseconomies Of Scale'', talking primarily about [[overconsumption]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kohr|first1=Leopold|title=The Overdeveloped Nations: The Diseconomies Of Scale|date=1977|publisher=Christopher Davies Publishers|location=Swansea}}</ref> This book is the basis for the theory of [[overdevelopment]], saying that the global north, the rich countries are too much developed what increases the [[Ecological footprint]] of humanity and create many problems both in overdeveloped and underdeveloped countries.<ref>Barkin, Samuel J. \"Trade, Sustainable Development and the Environment\", ''Global Environmental Politics'' 3:4, November 2003</ref>\n\n== Conceptual and ideological disagreements ==\n{{See also| Economic growth #Environmental impact|Post-scarcity economy}}\nSeveral conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space.\n\nIn 2019 a research, presenting an overview of the attempts to achieve constant economic growth without environmental destruction and their results, was published. It shows that by the year 2019 the attempts were not successful. It does not give a clear answer about future attempts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hickel |first1=Jason |last2=Kallis |first2=Giorgos |title=Is Green Growth Possible? |journal=New Political Economy |date=17 April 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/13563467.2019.1598964 |url=http://ddd.uab.cat/record/205316 }}</ref>\n\nHerman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.\n\n=== Role of technology ===\n{{See also | Productivity improving technologies | Production function | Pessimism #Entropy pessimism }}\n[[Technology]] is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding \nthe role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:\n\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.<ref name=cm01/>{{rp|508f}} <ref name=rc02/>{{rp|813\u2013816}} <ref name=tt02/>{{rp|409f}}\n\n[[File:2012 09 03 Br\u00fcckenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]\n* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology \u2014 useful though it is \u2014 works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] \u2014 or disorder \u2014 of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|18\u201325}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nFrom the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|15\u201319}} <ref name=js01/>{{rp|106\u2013109}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|80f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|116\u2013118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.<ref name=hd06/>{{rp|134f}}\n\n=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===\n{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}\n\nResource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural [[resource consumption]] to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption \u2014 that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|67f}}\n\n[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]\nIn the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income\u2013consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013163}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|40f}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|64f}}\n\nIn 2009, two separate studies were published that \u2014 among other things \u2014 addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].<ref name=ew02/> British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].<ref name=tj01/> Consider each in turn:\n* Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment \u2014 based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology \u2014 will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|11\u201318}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizs\u00e4cker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizs\u00e4cker notes that \"... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption.\"<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizs\u00e4cker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|309f}}\n* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' \u2014 that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP\u2014decreased by 33 percent;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that \"resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction,\" mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] \u2014 notably China \u2014 building up their [[infrastructure]].<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that \"simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.\"<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|188}}\n\nHerman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|61\u201364}}\n\n* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.\n* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).\n* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both \u2014 and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.\n\nFor all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|77\u201380}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|118}}\n\n=== Declining-state economy ===\n{{Distinguish|Recession}}\n{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}\n{{Further|Degrowth}}\n\nA declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.\n\nProponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].\n\n[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his \nparadigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth \u2014 that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].<ref name=ngr01/> In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|374\u2013379}} <ref name=jg02/>{{rp|150\u2013153}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013146}}\n\nAmerican political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner \u2014 who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work \u2014 have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:\n\n* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is incapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy \u2014 or what he terms an 'entropic society' \u2014 based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|205\u2013224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}\n* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that \"the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life.\"<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|103}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\nHerman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:\n\n{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}}}}\n\nDaly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\n=== Capitalism without growth ===\n{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}\nSeveral [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.<ref name=rs01/><ref name=jf01/><ref name=tt01/><ref name=rf01/>{{rp|97\u2013100}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|45\u201351}} <ref name=bb01/><ref name=pa01/> Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:\n[[File:I think he&#039;s running away from Wall Street... (3007506886).jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]\n* Economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige \u2014 or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.\n* [[Employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].\n* The [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.\n* [[Productivity improving technologies|Technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.\n* Private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.\n* Governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.\n* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.\n\u2014 In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.\n\nFully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):\n\n{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}}}\n\nDaly concludes by inviting all (most) people \u2014 both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism \u2014 to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}\n\n=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===\n{{Main| Asteroid mining}}\n{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}\n{{Further|Space advocacy}}\n\nEver since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).\n\n[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]\nIn the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K.

According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could \u2014 and indeed ''should'' \u2014 expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth \u2014 and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline \u2014 than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: \"The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies.\"<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\nBy the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation had long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.<ref name=wc01/><ref name=as02/><ref name=pm01/>\n\n[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]\nHowever, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space \u2014 and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.<ref name=hd07/>{{rp|24}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|81\u201383}} <ref name=te01/><ref name=ws01/><ref name=kz01/>\n\n=== Economic growth as a condition of military capability ===\n{{See also|Peace|military capability}}\n{{off topic|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE)]] mention on his site that the cold war was measured in GDP, and because of it was unsustainable referring to the book of Robert Collins, named: \"More: The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Czech |first1=Brian |last2=Mastini |first2=Riccardo |title=Degrowth Toward a Steady State Economy: Unifying Non-Growth Movements for Political Impact |url=https://steadystate.org/degrowth-toward-a-steady-state-economy-unifying-non-growth-movements-for-political-impact/ |website=Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy |accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>.

In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|545}} The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|303}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|85}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295f}}<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|55f}}\n\nThe world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or [[Overshoot (population)|population overshoot]]. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken \u2014 and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.<ref name=tj01/><ref name=bc01/><ref name=rd01/><ref name=ap01/>{{rp|148\u2013155}}\n \nA steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]]. An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].\n\n== Definition and vision ==\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]] \u2014 to such an extent that even his boldest critics recognize the prominence of his work.<ref name=ngr03/>{{rp|167}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|9}}\n\nHerman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy \u2014 something desirable by itself \u2014 maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14\u201319}}\n\nDaly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nIn the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ma01/>{{rp|84}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|83}}\n\n== Historical background ==\nFor centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].\n\n=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===\n{{main|Classical economics}}\n{{see also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}\nFrom [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|3}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295}}\n\n=== Adam Smith's concept ===\n{{main|Adam Smith}}\n{{see also|Invisible hand}}\n{{further|The Wealth of Nations}}\n[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]\n[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the [[enlightened self-interest]] of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|349f, 533f}}\n\nSmith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|59\u201368}}\n\nSmith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:\n\n{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}}}\n\nAccording to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, \"... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\n=== David Ricardo's concept ===\n{{Main|David Ricardo}}\n{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}\n{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}\n[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]\nIn the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade#Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|135f}}\n\nIn Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|6\u201310}}\n\nAccording to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers \u2013 Ricardo himself died in 1823 \u2013 directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|202f}}\n\nThe Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|88f}}\n\nRicardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).\n\n=== John Stuart Mill's concept ===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\n{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}\n{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]\nJohn Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|179}}\n\nA champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.<ref name=jsm02/> Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:\n\n{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...<ref name=jsm03/>{{rp|19}}}}\n\nMill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|16}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:\n\n{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592}}}}\n\nContrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not \"... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about \"... a very considerable improvement on our present condition.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by \u2014 instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592\u2013596}}\n\nHence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14f}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|79}}\n\n=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===\n{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}\nWhen the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:\n\n[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]\n{{anchor|Karl Marx}}\n* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of \"from each according to ability, to each according to need\" \u2014 that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Post-scarcity economy#Marxism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|57\u201365}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|218\u2013225}} <ref name=pb01/>{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that \"Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]].\"<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|52}}\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295\u2013299}} <ref name=rc01/>{{rp|55\u201357}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|156\u2013160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|121\u2013123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.<ref name=jb01/>{{rp|145\u2013148}}\n\nTaken together, it has been argued that \"... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics.\"<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has \nreintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).\n\n=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===\n{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}\n{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}\n{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}\n\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]\n[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.\n\nIn his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing \"bad attack of economic pessimism\" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' \u2014 avarice, exaction of interest, love of money \u2014 that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live \"wisely and agreeably and well.\" Mankind would finally have solved \"the economic problem,\" that is, the struggle for existence.<ref name=jmk01/><ref name=lp01/>{{rp|2, 11}}\n\nThe similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|3\u20136}}\n\nIn his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and \u2014 if population was not increasing rapidly \u2014 society would finally \"... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ...\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. \"I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work.\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|237}}\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===\nThe economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ===\n{{See also|Environmentalism#Post-war expansion}}\nAfter the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion \u2014 known today as the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]] \u2014 was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded \u2014 or later joined \u2014 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973\u201375 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].\n\nThroughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] \u2014 dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] \u2014 developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.<ref name=rc01/>{{rp|46f}} <ref name=mc01/>{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics \u2014 namely [[general equilibrium theory]] \u2014 was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy.<ref name=cs01/>{{rp|416\u2013422}}\n\nIn the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed \u2014 indeed, ''challenged'' \u2014 in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|296\u2013298}}\n\n=== Emerging ecological concerns ===\nDuring the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society:\n\n* In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'', economist and systems scientist [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution \u2014 like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.<ref name=kb01/><ref name=mc01/>{{rp|104}}\n* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).<ref name=ngr01/> In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ag01/>{{rp|13}} <ref name=kb02/>{{rp|164f}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013171}}\n* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today.<ref name=ho01/><ref name=rc01/>{{rp|68\u201371}} <ref name=cc01/>{{rp|14f}}\n\n{{anchor|LtG}}\n* In 1972, scientist and systems analyst [[Dennis Meadows]] and his team of researchers had their study on ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' published by the [[Club of Rome]]. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the [[world economy]] and made the projection \u2014 ''not'' prediction \u2014 that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and [[world population]] would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]].<ref name=dm02/> Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication.<ref name=mc01/>{{rp|244f}} <ref name=jn01/>{{rp|60f}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|50\u201362}} However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future.<ref name=ch01/>{{rp|230}} <ref name=aj01/>{{rp|8f}} <ref name=hs01/>{{rp|152\u2013155}} <ref name=gt01/><ref name=tj02/>{{rp|8}}\nTaken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|301\u2013305}}\n\n=== Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline ===\n{{Main| Ecological economics}}\nAlthough most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Mart\u00ednez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|308\u2013310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].\n\nWhen the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.<ref name=ir02/>{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.<ref name=ba01/><ref name=cs02/><ref name=gp01/>\n\n=== Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy ===\nSince the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.<ref name=hd01/><ref name=hd02/><ref name=hd03/>{{rp|117\u2013124}} <ref name=hd05/> He has also helped founding the ''Center for the Advancement of the Steady-State Economy'' (CASSE).<ref name=casse/> He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.<ref name=cr01/>\n\nAccording to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] \u2014 or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] \u2014 top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|146\u2013148}}\n\n[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]\nThe premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nDaly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may \u2014 within some practical limits \u2014 extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock \u2014 and not the Sun \u2014 that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|21f}}\n\n[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]\nDaly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.\n\nDaly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:\n\n{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point \u2014 the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|23}}}}\n\nFollowing the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:\n\n{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|36}}}}\n\nThis view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nIn Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that \"... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants\".<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.\n\n{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}\n[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]\nConsequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:\n\n* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.\n* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.\n* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).\n\nThe purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls \"a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity\" and providing \"the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|69}}\n\nAmong the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} \n<ref name=kb02/>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}\nResponding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: \"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\".<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...\n\n{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end \u2014 that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|370}}}}\n\nLater, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.<ref name=mr01/>{{rp|90f}} <ref name=mf01/>{{rp|105\u2013107}} <ref name=mb03/>{{rp|270}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=av01/>{{rp|37}}\n\n== Ecological reasons for a steady state economy ==\n=== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ===\n{{see also|Anthropocene|List of environmental issues|Planetary boundaries|Societal collapse}}\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Like any other planet, earth is finite]]\nThe world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy.

By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.<ref name=gfn01/><ref name=jw01/> In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.<ref name=welanth/> The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:\n\n;Overpopulation\nWorld population is [[Human overpopulation#Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population#Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].\n\n;Pollution and global warming\nAir pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many \u2014 if not all \u2014 parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability.

The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, [[Global warming|climate change]], [[pollution]] and [[invasive species]]. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to [[governance]].\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land.

Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding \nthe role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:\n\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.<ref name=cm01/>{{rp|508f}} <ref name=rc02/>{{rp|813\u2013816}} <ref name=tt02/>{{rp|409f}}\n\n[[File:2012 09 03 Br\u00fcckenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]\n* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology \u2014 useful though it is \u2014 works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] \u2014 or disorder \u2014 of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|18\u201325}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nFrom the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|15\u201319}} <ref name=js01/>{{rp|106\u2013109}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|80f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|116\u2013118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.<ref name=hd06/>{{rp|134f}}\n\n=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===\n{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}\n\nResource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural [[resource consumption]] to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption \u2014 that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|67f}}\n\n[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]\nIn the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income\u2013consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013163}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|40f}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|64f}}\n\nIn 2009, two separate studies were published that \u2014 among other things \u2014 addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].<ref name=ew02/> British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].<ref name=tj01/> Consider each in turn:\n* Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment \u2014 based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology \u2014 will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|11\u201318}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizs\u00e4cker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizs\u00e4cker notes that \"... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption.\"<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizs\u00e4cker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|309f}}\n* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' \u2014 that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP\u2014decreased by 33 percent;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that \"resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction,\" mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] \u2014 notably China \u2014 building up their [[infrastructure]].<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that \"simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.\"<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|188}}\n\nHerman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|61\u201364}}\n\n* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.\n* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).\n* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both \u2014 and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.\n\nFor all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|77\u201380}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|118}}\n\n=== Declining-state economy ===\n{{Distinguish|Recession}}\n{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}\n{{Further|Degrowth}}\n\nA declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.\n\nProponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].\n\n[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his \nparadigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth \u2014 that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].<ref name=ngr01/> In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|374\u2013379}} <ref name=jg02/>{{rp|150\u2013153}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013146}}\n\nAmerican political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner \u2014 who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work \u2014 have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:\n\n* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is incapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy \u2014 or what he terms an 'entropic society' \u2014 based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|205\u2013224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}\n* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that \"the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life.\"<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|103}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\nHerman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:\n\n{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}}}}\n\nDaly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\n=== Capitalism without growth ===\n{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}\nSeveral [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.<ref name=rs01/><ref name=jf01/><ref name=tt01/><ref name=rf01/>{{rp|97\u2013100}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|45\u201351}} <ref name=bb01/><ref name=pa01/> Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:\n[[File:I think he&#039;s running away from Wall Street... (3007506886).jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]\n* Economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige \u2014 or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.\n* [[Employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].\n* The [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.\n* [[Productivity improving technologies|Technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.\n* Private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.\n* Governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.\n* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.\n\u2014 In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.\n\nFully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):\n\n{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}}}\n\nDaly concludes by inviting all (most) people \u2014 both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism \u2014 to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}\n\n=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===\n{{Main| Asteroid mining}}\n{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}\n{{Further|Space advocacy}}\n\nEver since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).\n\n[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]\nIn the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] developed a large plan to [[Gerard K. O'Neill#Space colonization|build human settlements in outer space]] to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could \u2014 and indeed ''should'' \u2014 expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth \u2014 and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline \u2014 than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: \"The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies.\"<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\nBy the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation had long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.<ref name=wc01/><ref name=as02/><ref name=pm01/>\n\n[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]\nHowever, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space \u2014 and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.<ref name=hd07/>{{rp|24}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|81\u201383}} <ref name=te01/><ref name=ws01/><ref name=kz01/>\n\n=== Economic growth as a condition of military capability ===\n{{See also|Peace|military capability}}\n{{off topic|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE)]] mention on his site that the cold war was measured in GDP, and because of it was unsustainable referring to the book of Robert Collins, named: \"More: The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Czech |first1=Brian |last2=Mastini |first2=Riccardo |title=Degrowth Toward a Steady State Economy: Unifying Non-Growth Movements for Political Impact |url=https://steadystate.org/degrowth-toward-a-steady-state-economy-unifying-non-growth-movements-for-political-impact/ |website=Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy |accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>.

As a child, Harrison suffered from [[epileptic seizures]] starting at age eight, which would confine him to bed, and led to a lifelong love of reading. He became particularly enamored of a series of books by [[John D. Fitzgerald]] called ''[[The Great Brain]]'', whose main character, a ten-year-old Utah con artist named Tom D. Fitzgerald with the ability to conjure up money-making schemes, greatly influenced Harrison.<ref>Harrison, 2011. pp 7\u20139.</ref>\n\nHarrison developed a love of books in general, in particular on physics and history, with his favorite area of historical study being the [[Royal Navy]], from the late 1700s to the early 1800s.

Harrison worked for his father in the store in the daytime while [[repossessing]] cars at night. After five years the store moved to a larger location on [[Fremont Street]]. After two years at that location the Harrisons lost their lease. They subsequently moved into a new building in a commercial neighborhood on Las Vegas Boulevard.<ref>Harrison (2011), pp. 38, 50.</ref> Harrison relates in his autobiography that he and his father had long-sought to convert the store into a pawn shop, calling it a \"logical progression.\" Because of a 1955 Las Vegas law requiring the issuing of new pawn licenses to be limited on the basis of the city's population, which by 1988 was over 200,000 and rapidly growing, Harrison called the city statistician every week, so that they could apply for a rare and much-coveted pawn license as soon as the city's population reached 250,000. By 1989 the city's population reached that number and after some legal struggles, the Harrisons obtained their pawn license.<ref>Harrison (2011), pp. 50 - 53.</ref> That year Harrison and his father opened the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop less than two miles from the [[Las Vegas Strip]].<ref name=LasVegasWeekly/> By 2005, Harrison and his father were loaning out about $3 million annually, which brought them about $700,000 in interest income.<ref>{{cite news|page=2|newspaper=Las Vegas Business Press|date=July 4, 2005|volume=22|issue=27|title=Pawnbrokers break the stereotype|author=Steven Mihailovich}}</ref>\n\nBy 2006, the shop had developed a reputation for carrying special sports items with unique histories,<ref>{{cite news|page=A8|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=July 26, 2006|title=Ron Kantowski visits a Las Vegas pawnshop, where some special sports items come complete with a story, and others remain shrouded in mystery, waiting to be bought by someone who will put them in the place of honor they deserve|author=Kantowski, Ron|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/jul/26/ron-kantowski-visits-a-las-vegas-pawnshop-where-so|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref> including a 2001 [[New England Patriots]] [[Super Bowl]] ring that belonged to [[American football]] [[cornerback]] [[Brock Williams]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Boston Herald]]|date=July 31, 2006|title=Inside Track: Lowell scene of 'Car Trouble' for Greek screen goddess Olympia|author=Gayle Fee And Laura Raposa}}</ref> It also served gamblers who, according to Harrison's son Corey, often came in to \"pawn something so they have gas to get back home.\"<ref>{{cite news|page=10|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 14, 2008|title=The Nation: Hard times are their stock in trade|author=Powers, Ashley|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/14/nation/na-pawnbroker14|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Harrison in 2010, the items most often brought into the store are [[jewelry]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pezzed Off|series=Pawn Stars|season=2|number=15|airdate=January 25, 2010|network=History}}</ref> Since the inception of ''Pawn Stars'', Harrison's inventory typically has a ratio of 5,000 items pawned per 12,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Television and fame===\nHarrison spent four years pitching the idea of making a show about a pawn shop after his shop was featured in the show ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' in 2003, but his efforts did not yield success.

As a child, Harrison suffered from [[epileptic seizures]] starting at age eight, which would confine him to bed, and led to a lifelong love of reading. He became particularly enamored of a series of books by [[John D. Fitzgerald]] called ''[[The Great Brain]]'', whose main character, a ten-year-old Utah con artist named Tom D.

As Kao's sister goes to college, he supports his mom financially by doing part-time tutoring to high school students. The director of the school where his mom works asks Kao to tutor his son, Non ([[Chayapol Jutamat]]), after hearing that he is a good tutor. Pete crosses paths with Non in a competition and pisses him off after learning that Kao is tutoring him. With Non fueling Pete's jealousy, his relationship with Kao gets tested in several occasions.\n\nSun ([[Supakorn Sriphotong]]), who was pursuing Kao before, has been nagging Mork ([[Gawin Caskey]]) for dragging his younger brother, Rain ([[Pluem Pongpisal]]) into his troubles. To help him change his life, Sun offers Mork a job in his caf\u00e9. Along the way, the two of them start to care for each other. However, with Mork's dangerous life still troubling him, Sun makes it clear that he is there because he cares for him.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web

As Kao's sister goes to college, he supports his mom financially by doing part-time tutoring to high school students. The director of the school where his mom works asks Kao to tutor his son, Non ([[Chayapol Jutamat]]), after hearing that he is a good tutor. Pete crosses paths with Non in a competition and pisses him off after learning that Kao is tutoring him. With Non fueling Pete's jealousy, his relationship with Kao gets tested in several occasions.\n\nSun ([[Supakorn Sriphotong]]), who was pursuing Kao before, has been nagging Mork ([[Gawin Caskey]]) for dragging his younger brother, Rain ([[Pluem Pongpisal]]) into his troubles. To help him change his life, Sun offers Mork a job in his caf\u00e9. Along the way, the two of them start to care for each other. However, with Mork's dangerous life still troubling him, Sun makes it clear that he is there because he cares for him.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web

This was in 1983, at the height of the Hungarian punk blast, a period in which a punk gig caused big agitation, occasionally by starting riots.\n\n\u201c We started criticizing the Soviet Army a little bit too early. It wasn\u2019t really a surprise when the authorities sent us for a trial because of anticommunist lyrics. Our original singer \u201cDauer\u201d had to spend two years in prison because according to the authorities he had chosen the \u201cwrong words\u201d, Vigi reminds of the old, \u201cromantic\u201d days.\n\nOther punks didn\u2019t have as much luck as Aurora: Two members of the Hungarian punk band [[CPg]] were found guilty and sent to prison for two years because of making jokes about communists. After having stayed in prison the members of CPg had to leave Hungary and so did the Aurora\u2019s former singer \u201cDauer\u201d. Therefore, \u201cAurora\u201d needed a new vocalist and found it in the attractive blond female singer called \u201cKriszta\u201d, but she also left the band after a very short time. \u201cShe was a very wild and fascinating person on stage, but she didn\u2019t take her job as seriously as we did.\u201d says Vigi \u201cso that finally I had to sing because we couldn\u2019t find any suitable substitute for her. Since then we have playing as a trio.\n\nSome unreleased songs on the \u201cBest Of\u201d compilation are taken from this period like \u201cKis Kurva\u201d.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1988 the band was playing under false names in order not to attract the attention of the \u201cold friends\u201d, the Hungarian Secret Service. At this time the band caught the attention of some Austrian punks who invited \u201cAurora\u201d to play in Vienna.

This was in 1983, at the height of the Hungarian punk blast, a period in which a punk gig caused big agitation, occasionally by starting riots.\n\n\u201c We started criticizing the Soviet Army a little bit too early. It wasn\u2019t really a surprise when the authorities sent us for a trial because of anticommunist lyrics. Our original singer \u201cDauer\u201d had to spend two years in prison because according to the authorities he had chosen the \u201cwrong words\u201d, Vigi reminds of the old, \u201cromantic\u201d days.\n\nOther punks didn\u2019t have as much luck as Aurora: Two members of the Hungarian punk band [[CPg]] were found guilty and sent to prison for two years because of making jokes about communists. After having stayed in prison the members of CPg had to leave Hungary and so did the Aurora\u2019s former singer \u201cDauer\u201d. Therefore, \u201cAurora\u201d needed a new vocalist and found it in the attractive blond female singer called \u201cKriszta\u201d, but she also left the band after a very short time. \u201cShe was a very wild and fascinating person on stage, but she didn\u2019t take her job as seriously as we did.\u201d says Vigi \u201cso that finally I had to sing because we couldn\u2019t find any suitable substitute for her. Since then we have playing as a trio.\n\nSome unreleased songs on the \u201cBest Of\u201d compilation are taken from this period like \u201cKis Kurva\u201d.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1988 the band was playing under false names in order not to attract the attention of the \u201cold friends\u201d, the Hungarian Secret Service. At this time the band caught the attention of some Austrian punks who invited \u201cAurora\u201d to play in Vienna. This was the first time the band played a concert outside Eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cAurora\u201d became a regular and famous guest in Vienna and went on their first big Germany-tour in 1988 with the help of some German friends. The money they made on tour was spent on recording their first self-titled EP in Germany. Under the assistance Hardly Heinlin and released on the German label \u201cEmpty Records\u201d. \u201cAt this time it was nearly impossible to record in state-controlled studios in Hungary\u201d, Vigi says, \u201cOur debut EP may sound a little bit strong and brutal because we recorded it live in the studio, but we prefer this kind of full sound and we like it\u2019s atmosphere, its feeling.\u201d\n\nThe EP wasn\u2019t very successful in contrast to their first album, the legendary \u201cViszl\u00e1t Iv\u00e1n\u201d (Goodbye Ivan)-LP which was released in 1989.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] and [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.

A fair number are meteorologists, however, most storm chasers may be from any number of occupational fields that have little or nothing to do with meteorology. A large majority of chasers are male and white but a minority are female or of Asian or other descents. The average age is probably around 35 but chasers could theoretically be of any age. A relatively high proportion possess college degrees and a large number live in the central and southern U.S. Many are lovers of [[nature]] with interests that also include [[flora]], [[fauna]], [[volcano]]es, [[aurora]], [[meteor]]s, [[eclipse]]s, and [[astronomy]].<ref name=\"ST FAQ\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe first recognized storm chaser is [[David K.

Ward]] (1914\u20131972) who in the 1950s and 1960s enlisted the help of [[Oklahoma Highway Patrol]] to study storms. His work pioneered modern storm spotting and made institutional chasing a reality.\n\nThe first coordinated storm chasing activity sponsored by institutions was undertaken as part of the [[Alberta Hail Project|Alberta Hail Studies]] project beginning in 1969.<ref name=\"ALHAS\">{{cite journal |last1=Barge |first=B.

(TV series)|In Search of...]]''; in 1985 with a documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]''; and in May 1996 with the theatrical release of ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' which provided an action-packed but distorted glimpse at the hobby. Further early exposure to storm chasing encouraging some in the weather community resulted from several articles beginning in the late 1970s in ''[[Weatherwise]]'' magazine.\n\nVarious television programs and increased coverage of severe weather by the media, especially since the initial video revolution in which VHS ownership became widespread by the early 1990s, substantially elevated awareness of and interest in storms and storm chasing. The advent of the Internet, in particular, contributed to a significant growth in number of storm chasers since the mid-late 1990s. A sharp increase in the general public impulsively wandering in their local area searching for tornadoes similarly is largely attributable to these factors. The 2007\u20132011 Discovery Channel reality series ''[[Storm Chasers (TV series)|Storm Chasers]]'' produced another surge in activity. Over the years the nature of chasing and the characteristics of chasers shifted.\n\nFrom their advent in the 1970s until the mid-1990s, scientific [[Field experiment|field projects]] were occasionally conducted during spring in the Great Plains.<ref name=\"field programs history\"/> Then, the first of the seminal [[VORTEX projects]] occurred in 1994\u201395<ref name=\"VORTEX\">{{cite journal |last = Rasmussen |first = Erik N. |authorlink = Erik N.

It is not uncommon for a chaser to end up empty handed on any particular day. Storm chasers' degrees of involvement, competencies, philosophies, and techniques vary widely, but many chasers spend a significant amount of time forecasting, both before going on the road as well as during the chase, utilizing various sources for weather data. Most storm chasers are not meteorologists, and many chasers expend significant time and effort in learning meteorology and the intricacies of severe convective storm prediction through both study and experience.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nBesides the copious driving to, from, and during chases, storm chasing is punctuated with contrasting periods of long waiting and ceaseless action. Downtime can consist of sitting under sun-baked skies for hours, playing pickup sports, evaluating data, or visiting landmarks while awaiting convective initiation. During an inactive pattern, this down time can persist for days. When storms are going there is often little or no time to eat or relieve oneself and finding fuel can cause frustrating delays and detours. Navigating obstacles such as rivers and areas with inadequate road networks is a paramount concern. Only a handful of chasers decide to chase [[Dixie Alley]], an area of the Southern United States in which trees and road networks heavily obscure the often large tornadoes. The combination of driving and waiting has been likened to \"extreme sitting\".<ref>{{cite book |last = Svenold |first = Mark |title = Big Weather: Chasing Tornadoes in the Heart of America |publisher = Holt |year = 2005 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0805076462 |url = https://archive.org/details/bigweatherchasin00sven }}</ref> A \"bust\" occurs when storms do not fire, sometimes referred to as \"severe clear\", when storms fire but are missed, when storms fire but are meager, or when storms fire after dusk.\n\nMost chasing is accomplished by driving, however, a few individuals occasionally fly planes and television stations in some markets use helicopters. Research projects sometimes employ aircraft, as well.\n\n==Geographical, seasonal, and diurnal activity==\nStorm chasers are most active in the spring and early summer, particularly May and June, across the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]] (extending into [[Canada]]) in an area colloquially known as [[Tornado Alley]], with many hundred individuals active on some days during this period. This coincides with the most consistent tornado days<ref>{{cite web |last = Brooks |first = Harold |authorlink = Harold E. Brooks |author2=P.R. Concannon |author3=C.A. Doswell |title = Severe Thunderstorm Climatology |publisher = National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = 2003-08-29 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/ |accessdate = 2012-02-27 }}</ref> in the most desirable topography of the Great Plains. Not only are the most intense [[supercell]]s common here, but due to the moisture profile of the atmosphere the storms tend to be more visible than locations farther east where there are also frequent severe thunderstorms. There is a tendency for chases earlier in the year to be farther south, shifting farther north with the [[jet stream]] as the season progresses. Storms occurring later in the year tend to be more isolated and slower moving, both of which are also desirable to chasers.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nChasers may operate whenever significant thunderstorm activity is occurring, whatever the date. This most commonly includes more sporadic activity occurring in warmer months of the year bounding the spring maximum, such as the active month of April and to a lesser extent March. The focus in the summer months is the Central or Northern Plains states and the Prairie Provinces, the Upper Midwest, or on to just east of the [[Colorado Front Range]]. An annually inconsistent and substantially smaller peak of severe thunderstorm and tornado activity also arises in the transitional months of autumn, particularly October and November. This follows a pattern somewhat the reverse of the spring pattern with the focus beginning in the north then dropping south and with an overall eastward shift. In the area with the most consistent [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornado activity, the Southern Plains, the tornado season is intense but is relatively brief whereas central to northern and eastern areas experience less intense and consistent activity that is diffused over a longer span of the year.<ref name=\"ST FAQ\"/>\n\nAdvancing technology since the mid-2000s led to chasers more commonly targeting less amenable areas (i.e. hilly or forested) that were previously eschewed when continuous wide visibility was critical. These advancements, particularly in-vehicle weather data such as radar, also led to an increase in chasing after nightfall. Most chasing remains during daylight hours with active storm intercepting peaking from mid-late afternoon through early-to-mid evening. This is dictated by a chaser's schedule (availability to chase) and by when storms form, which usually is around peak heating during the mid-to-late afternoon but on some days occurs in early afternoon or even in the morning. An additional advantage of later season storms is that days are considerably longer than in early spring. Morning or early afternoon storms tend to be associated with stronger [[wind shear]] and thus most often happen earlier in the spring season or later during the fall season.\n\nSome organized chasing efforts have also begun in the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]] and in southeastern [[Australia]],<ref>{{cite news |last = McLaughlin |first = Murray  |title = Storm chasers hit Top End |work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |publisher = 7.30 Report |date = 2003-12-17 |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1012266.htm |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Krien |first = Anna |authorlink1=Anna Krien|title = Weather from hell is heaven on earth for storm troops |work = Fairfax Digital |publisher = The Age |date = 2004-07-04 |url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/03/1088488200242.html |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}</ref> with the biggest successes in November and December. A handful of individuals are also known to be chasing in other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Argentina]], [[South Africa]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[New Zealand]]; although many people trek to the Great Plains of [[North America]] from these and other countries around the world (especially from the UK). The number of chasers and number countries where chasers are active expanded at an accelerating pace in Europe from the 1990s\u20132010s.\n\n==Dangers==\nThere are inherent dangers involved in pursuing hazardous weather. These range from lightning, tornadoes, large hail, flooding, hazardous road conditions (rain or hail-covered roadways), animals on the roadway, downed power lines (and occasionally other debris), reduced visibility from heavy rain (often wind blown), blowing [[Dust storm|dust]], and [[hail fog]]. Most directly weather-related hazards such as from a tornado are minimized if the storm chaser is knowledgeable and cautious. In some situations severe [[downburst]] winds may push automobiles around, especially high-profile vehicles. Tornadoes affect a relatively small area and are predictable enough to be avoided if sustaining [[situational awareness]] and following strategies including always having an open escape route, maintaining a safe distance, and avoiding placement in the direction of travel of a tornado (in most cases in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] this is to the north and to the east of a tornado). Lightning, however, is an unavoidable hazard. \"Core punching\", storm chaser slang for driving through a heavy precipitation core to intercept the area of interest within a storm, is recognized as hazardous due to reduced visibility and because many tornadoes are rain-wrapped. The \"bear's cage\" refers to the area under a rotating [[wall cloud]] (and any attendant tornadoes), which is the \"bear\", and to the blinding precipitation (which can include window-shatteringly large hail) surrounding some or all sides of a tornado, which is the \"cage\". Similarly, chasing at night heightens risk due to darkness.<ref name=\"Storm Talk\">{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Tim |authorlink=Timothy P. Marshall |others=David Hoadley (illust.) |title=Storm Talk |date=May 1995 |location= }}</ref>\n\nIn reality, the most significant hazard is [[driving]],<ref name=\"Storm Talk\"/><ref name=\"Doswell ethics\"/> which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple [[Distracted driving|distractions]] which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, [[Defensive driving|prudence]] is key to [[Road traffic safety|minimizing]] the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from [[Human multitasking|multitasking]] either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things if he or she is chasing alone. Falling [[Sleep-deprived driving|asleep]] while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the [[Fatigue (safety)|defatigating demands]] of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book |last= Vasquez |first= Tim |authorlink= |title= Storm Chasing Handbook |publisher= Weather Graphics Technologies |edition= 2nd |year= 2008 |location= Garland, TX |url= http://weathergraphics.com/chasing/ |isbn= 978-0-9706840-8-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book |last= Marshall |first= Tim |authorlink= Timothy P.

The first in-field technology consisted of radio gear for communication. Much of this equipment could also be adapted to receive [[radiofax]] data which was useful for receiving basic observational and analysis data. The primary users of such technology were university or government research groups who often had larger budgets than individual chasers.\n\nRadio scanners were also heavily used to listen in on [[emergency service]]s and storm spotters so as to determine where the most active or dangerous weather was located. A number of chasers were also [[Amateur radio operator|radio amateurs]], and used mobile (or portable) [[amateur radio]] to communicate directly with spotters and other chasers, allowing them to keep abreast of what they could not themselves see.\n\nIt was not until the mid- to late 1980s that the evolution of the [[laptop]] computer would begin to revolutionize storm chasing. Early on, some chasers carried [[acoustic coupler]]s to download batches of raw surface and upper air data from payphones. The technology was too slow for graphical imagery such as [[Weather radar|radar]] and [[Weather satellite|satellite]] data; and during the first years this wasn't available on any connection over telephone lines, anyway. Some raw data could be downloaded and plotted by software, such as [[surface weather observation]]s using ''WeatherGraphix''<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.weathergraphics.com/dl/|title=Software Download Center - Weather Graphics|website=www.weathergraphics.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> (predecessor to ''Digital Atmosphere'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weathergraphics.com/da/|title=Digital Atmosphere - Weather Graphics|website=www.weathergraphics.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> and similar software or for upper air soundings using ''SHARP'',<ref name=\"auto\"/> ''RAOB'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://raob.com/|title=RAOB: The Universal RAwinsonde OBservation program|website=raob.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> <!-- http://www.weathergraphics.com/raob/ --> and similar software.\n\nMost meteorological data was acquired all at once early in the morning, and the rest of day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; as well as on visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted [[weather map]]s were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. [[NOAA Weather Radio]] (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|weather watches and warning]]s, surface weather conditions, [[Storm Prediction Center#Convective outlooks|convective outlook]]s, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use high-speed Internet access available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.\n\nWith the development of the mobile computers, the first computer mapping software became feasible, at about the same time as the popular adoption of the [[VHS]] [[camcorder]] began a rapid growth phase. Prior to the mid to late 1980s most motion picture equipment consisted of [[8 mm film]] cameras. While the quality of the first VHS consumer cameras was quite poor (and the size somewhat cumbersome) when compared to traditional film formats, the amount of [[Videotape|video]] which could be shot with a minimal amount of resources was much greater than any [[Film stock|film format]] at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s [[The Weather Channel]] (TWC) and ''[[A.M. Weather]]'' were popular with chasers, in the morning preceding a chase for the latter and both before and during a chase for the former. Commercial radio sometimes also provides weather and damage information. The 1990s brought technological leaps and bounds. With the swift development of [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] technology, television sets for example could be installed with ease in most vehicles allowing storm chasers to actively view local TV stations. Mobile phones became popular making group coordination easier when traditional radio communications methods were not ideal or for those possessing radios. The development of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) in 1993 hastened adoption of the Internet and led to [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] access to some of the first university weather sites.\n\nThe mid-1990s marked the development of smaller more efficient marine radars. While such marine radars are illegal if used in land-mobile situations, a number of chasers were quick to adopt them in an effort to have mobile radar. These radars have been found to interfere with research radars, such as the [[Doppler on Wheels]] (DOW) utilized in field projects. The first personal [[lightning detection]] and mapping devices also became available<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boltek.com/|title=Boltek &#124; Lightning Detection Systems|website=www.boltek.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> and the first online radar data was offered by private corporations or, at first with delays, with free services. A popular data vendor by the end of the 1990s was [[WeatherTAP]].\n\n===Current===\n[[File:Tornado intercept vehicle.jpg|{{largethumb}}|A heavily armored [[Tornado Intercept Vehicle]] used to film inside a tornado with an [[IMAX]] camera, and featured in the Discovery Channel series, [[Storm Chasers (TV series)|''Storm Chasers'']].]]\n[[File:SRV Dominator 2 crop.jpg|{{largethumb}}|An SRV, a.k.a. [[SRV Dominator|\"The Dominator\"]], featured in the Discovery Channel series, [[Storm Chasers (TV series)|''Storm Chasers'']].]]\n\nChasers used paper [[Road map|maps]] for navigation and some of those now using GPS still use these as a backup or for strategizing with other chasers. Foldable state maps can be used but are cumbersome due to the multitude of states needed and only show major roads. National atlases allow more detail and all states are contained in a single book, with [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] favored and [[Rand McNally]] followed by [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] also used. The preferred atlases due to great detail in rural areas are the \"''Roads of...''\" series originally by Shearer Publishing, which first included Texas but expanded to other states such as Oklahoma and Colorado. Covering every state of the union are the [[DeLorme]] \"Atlas and Gazetteer\" series. DeLorme also produced early GPS receivers that connected to laptops and for years was one of two major mapping software creators. ''DeLorme Street Atlas USA'' or ''[[Microsoft Streets & Trips]]'' were used by most chasers until their discontinuations in 2013. Chasers now use [[Google Maps]] or other [[web mapping]] as no suitable alternative mapping software emerged. GPS receivers may still be used with other software, such as for displaying radar data.\n\nA major turning point was the advent of civilian [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] in 1996. At first, GPS units were very costly and only offered basic functions, but that would soon change. Towards the late 1990s the Internet was awash in weather data and free weather software, the first true cellular Internet modems for consumer use also emerged providing chasers access to data in the field without having to rely on a nowcaster. The NWS also released the first free, up-to-date [[NEXRAD]] Level 3 radar data. In conjunction with all of this, GPS units now had the ability to connect with computers, granting greater ease when navigating.\n\n2001 marked the next great technological leap for storm chasers as the first [[Wi-Fi]] units began to emerge offering wireless broadband service in many cases for free. Some places (restaurants, motels, libraries, etc.) were known to reliably offer wireless access and [[wardriving]] located other availabilities. In 2002 the first [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based package to combine GPS positioning and Doppler radar appeared called SWIFT WX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherdefender.com/|title=Weather Defender - Weather software, live weather radar for your desktop.|website=www.weatherdefender.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> SWIFT WX allowed storm chasers to seamlessly position themselves accurately relative to tornadic storms.\n\nIn 2004 two more storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, was a new [[XM Satellite Radio]] based system<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wxworx.com/|title=WxWorx &#124; Pilot & Marine Weather &#124; Storm Chasers &#124; Huntsville, AL|website=WxWorx Store|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> utilizing a special receiver and [[Baron Services]] weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant that even in the most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grlevelx.com/|title=GRLevelX Main Page|website=www.grlevelx.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> [[GRLevelX|GRLevel3]] utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true [[Vector graphics|vector]] format with [[Geographic information system|GIS]] layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using [[Spotter Network]] (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.\n\nThe most common chaser communications device is the [[Mobile phone|cellular phone]]. These are used for both voice and data connections. External antennas and amplifiers may be used to boost signal transception. It is not uncommon that chasers travel in small groups of cars, and they may use [[Citizens Band radio|CB radio]] (declining in use) or inexpensive [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS]] / [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] hand-held [[transceiver]]s for inter-vehicle communication. More commonly, many chasers are also ham radio operators and use the [[2-meter band|2 meters]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and, less often, [[70-centimeter band|70 cm]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands to communicate between vehicles or with [[Skywarn]] / [[Canwarn]] spotter networks. [[Scanner (radio)|Scanners]] are often used to monitor spotter, sometimes public safety communications, and can double as [[weather radio]]s. Since the mid-2000s [[social networking services]] may also be used, with [[Twitter]] most used for ongoing events, [[Facebook]] for sharing images and discussing chase reports, and [[Instagram]] trailing in adoption. Social networking services largely (but not completely) replace forums and email lists, which complemented and eventually supplanted ''Stormtrack'' magazine, for conversing about storms.\n\nIn-field environmental data is still popular among some storm chasers, especially [[temperature]], moisture, and [[wind speed]] and [[Wind direction|direction]] data. Many have chosen to mount weather stations atop their vehicles. Others use handheld [[anemometer]]s. Rulers or baseballs may be brought along for measuring hail and for showing as a comparison object. Vehicle mounted cameras, such as on the roof or more commonly on the dash, provide continuous visual recording capability.\n\nChasers heavily utilized still [[photography]] since the beginning. [[Videography]] gained prominence by the 1990s into the early 2000s but a resurgence of photography occurred with the advent of affordable and versatile [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR]] (DSLR) [[Still camera|cameras]]. Prior to this, [[35mm format|35 mm]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[Photographic film|print]] and [[Reversal film|slide]] [[film format]]s were mostly used, along with some [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] cameras. In the late 2000s, mobile phone [[3G]] data networks became fast enough to allow [[live streaming]] video from chasers using webcams. This live imagery is frequently used by the media, as well as NWS meteorologists, emergency managers, and the general public for direct ground truth information, and it promotes video sales opportunities for chasers. Also by this time, camcorders using [[memory card]]s to record video began to be adopted. [[DV|Digital video]] had been around for years but was recorded on [[Magnetic tape|tape]], whereas [[Solid-state storage|solid-state]] is [[random access]] rather than [[sequential access]] (linear) and has no moving parts. Late in the 2000s [[High-definition video|HD video]] began to overtake [[Standard-definition television|SD]] (which had been [[NTSC]] in North America) in usage as prices came down and performance increased (initially there were low-light and sporadic aliasing problems due to chip and sensor limitations). By the mid-2010s [[4K resolution|4K]] cameras were increasingly in use. [[Tripod (photography)|Tripods]] are used by those seeking crisp professional photo and video imagery and also enable chasers to tend to other activities. Other accessories include cable/remote shutter releases, lightning triggers, and lens filters. Windshield mounted cameras or dome enclosed cameras atop vehicle roofs may also be used, and a few chasers use [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] (\"drones\").\n\nLate in the 2000s [[smartphone]]s increased in usage, with radar viewing applications frequently used. Particularly, ''RadarScope''<ref>http://www.basevelocity.com/</ref> on the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms is favored. ''Pkyl3''<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pykl3radar.com/|title=PYKL3 Radar|website=www.pykl3radar.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> was a dominant early choice on Android devices which discontinued development in August 2018.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other apps may be used as are browsers for viewing meteorological data and accessing social networking services. Some handsets can be used as [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|WiFi hotspots]] and wireless cards may also be used to avoid committing a handset to [[tethering]] or operating as a hotspot. Some hotspots operate as [[mobile broadband]] [[Mobile virtual network operator|MNVO]] devices using any radio spectrum that is both available and is in contract with a service provider. Such devices may expand mobile data range beyond a single carrier's service area and typically can work on month-to-month contracts. Adoption of [[tablet computer]]s expanded by the early 2010s. [[LTE (telecommunication)|4G LTE]] has been adopted when available and can be especially useful for uploading HD video. A gradual uptick of those selecting [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]]s (MILCs) began in the mid-2010s. Usage of DSLR for video capture, called HDSLR, is common, although HD camcorders remain popular due to their greater functionality (many chasers still shoot both).\n\nChasers also carry common travel articles and vehicle maintenance items, and sometimes [[first aid kit]]s. Full sized [[spare tire]]s are strongly preferable to \"donut\" emergency replacement tires. [[Power inverter]]s (often with [[Surge protector|surged protected]] [[power strips]]) power devices that require [[Alternating current|AC]] (indoor/wall outlet) power, although some devices may be powered directly with [[Direct current|DC]] (battery power) from the vehicle electric system. Water repellent products, such as [[Rain-X]] or [[Aquapel (glass treatment)|Aquapel]], are frequently applied to windshields to dispel water when driving as well as mud and small detritus, which boosts visibility and image clarity on photographs and videos shot through glass (which is particularly problematic if [[autofocus]] is on). [[Binoculars]] and sunglasses are commonly employed.\n\n==Ethics==\nA growing number of experienced storm chasers advocate the adoption of a code of [[ethics]] in storm chasing featuring safety, courtesy, and objectivity as the backbone.<ref name=\"Doswell ethics\">{{cite web |last=Doswell III  |first=Charles A.  |title=Storm Chasing with Safety, Courtesy, and Responsibility  |url=http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/chasesums/Chase_safety.html  |publisher=Michael Graff  |access-date=21 April 2008  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121113806/http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/chasesums/Chase_safety.html  |archive-date=21 January 2009  |date=4 April 2009  |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Moller  |first=Alan |authorlink= Alan Moller  |title=Storm Chase Ethics  |journal=Storm Track  |volume=15  |issue=3  |pages=8\u20139  |date=Mar 1992  |url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~stumpf/cethics.html }}</ref> Storm chasing is a highly visible recreational activity (which is also associated with [[science]]) that is vulnerable to sensationalist media promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stormtrack.org/library/faq/|title=The Online Storm Chasing FAQ by Roger Edwards and Tim Vasquez|website=stormtrack.org|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> Veteran storm chasers [[Charles A.

(TV series)|In Search of...]]''; in 1985 with a documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]''; and in May 1996 with the theatrical release of ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' which provided an action-packed but distorted glimpse at the hobby. Further early exposure to storm chasing encouraging some in the weather community resulted from several articles beginning in the late 1970s in ''[[Weatherwise]]'' magazine.\n\nVarious television programs and increased coverage of severe weather by the media, especially since the initial video revolution in which VHS ownership became widespread by the early 1990s, substantially elevated awareness of and interest in storms and storm chasing. The advent of the Internet, in particular, contributed to a significant growth in number of storm chasers since the mid-late 1990s. A sharp increase in the general public impulsively wandering in their local area searching for tornadoes similarly is largely attributable to these factors. The 2007\u20132011 Discovery Channel reality series ''[[Storm Chasers (TV series)|Storm Chasers]]'' produced another surge in activity. Over the years the nature of chasing and the characteristics of chasers shifted.\n\nFrom their advent in the 1970s until the mid-1990s, scientific [[Field experiment|field projects]] were occasionally conducted during spring in the Great Plains.<ref name=\"field programs history\"/> Then, the first of the seminal [[VORTEX projects]] occurred in 1994\u201395<ref name=\"VORTEX\">{{cite journal |last = Rasmussen |first = Erik N. |authorlink = Erik N.

It is not uncommon for a chaser to end up empty handed on any particular day. Storm chasers' degrees of involvement, competencies, philosophies, and techniques vary widely, but many chasers spend a significant amount of time forecasting, both before going on the road as well as during the chase, utilizing various sources for weather data. Most storm chasers are not meteorologists, and many chasers expend significant time and effort in learning meteorology and the intricacies of severe convective storm prediction through both study and experience.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nBesides the copious driving to, from, and during chases, storm chasing is punctuated with contrasting periods of long waiting and ceaseless action. Downtime can consist of sitting under sun-baked skies for hours, playing pickup sports, evaluating data, or visiting landmarks while awaiting convective initiation. During an inactive pattern, this down time can persist for days. When storms are going there is often little or no time to eat or relieve oneself and finding fuel can cause frustrating delays and detours. Navigating obstacles such as rivers and areas with inadequate road networks is a paramount concern. Only a handful of chasers decide to chase [[Dixie Alley]], an area of the Southern United States in which trees and road networks heavily obscure the often large tornadoes. The combination of driving and waiting has been likened to \"extreme sitting\".<ref>{{cite book |last = Svenold |first = Mark |title = Big Weather: Chasing Tornadoes in the Heart of America |publisher = Holt |year = 2005 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0805076462 |url = https://archive.org/details/bigweatherchasin00sven }}</ref> A \"bust\" occurs when storms do not fire, sometimes referred to as \"severe clear\", when storms fire but are missed, when storms fire but are meager, or when storms fire after dusk.\n\nMost chasing is accomplished by driving, however, a few individuals occasionally fly planes and television stations in some markets use helicopters. Research projects sometimes employ aircraft, as well.\n\n==Geographical, seasonal, and diurnal activity==\nStorm chasers are most active in the spring and early summer, particularly May and June, across the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]] (extending into [[Canada]]) in an area colloquially known as [[Tornado Alley]], with many hundred individuals active on some days during this period. This coincides with the most consistent tornado days<ref>{{cite web |last = Brooks |first = Harold |authorlink = Harold E. Brooks |author2=P.R. Concannon |author3=C.A. Doswell |title = Severe Thunderstorm Climatology |publisher = National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = 2003-08-29 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/ |accessdate = 2012-02-27 }}</ref> in the most desirable topography of the Great Plains. Not only are the most intense [[supercell]]s common here, but due to the moisture profile of the atmosphere the storms tend to be more visible than locations farther east where there are also frequent severe thunderstorms. There is a tendency for chases earlier in the year to be farther south, shifting farther north with the [[jet stream]] as the season progresses. Storms occurring later in the year tend to be more isolated and slower moving, both of which are also desirable to chasers.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nChasers may operate whenever significant thunderstorm activity is occurring, whatever the date. This most commonly includes more sporadic activity occurring in warmer months of the year bounding the spring maximum, such as the active month of April and to a lesser extent March. The focus in the summer months is the Central or Northern Plains states and the Prairie Provinces, the Upper Midwest, or on to just east of the [[Colorado Front Range]]. An annually inconsistent and substantially smaller peak of severe thunderstorm and tornado activity also arises in the transitional months of autumn, particularly October and November. This follows a pattern somewhat the reverse of the spring pattern with the focus beginning in the north then dropping south and with an overall eastward shift. In the area with the most consistent [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornado activity, the Southern Plains, the tornado season is intense but is relatively brief whereas central to northern and eastern areas experience less intense and consistent activity that is diffused over a longer span of the year.<ref name=\"ST FAQ\"/>\n\nAdvancing technology since the mid-2000s led to chasers more commonly targeting less amenable areas (i.e. hilly or forested) that were previously eschewed when continuous wide visibility was critical. These advancements, particularly in-vehicle weather data such as radar, also led to an increase in chasing after nightfall. Most chasing remains during daylight hours with active storm intercepting peaking from mid-late afternoon through early-to-mid evening. This is dictated by a chaser's schedule (availability to chase) and by when storms form, which usually is around peak heating during the mid-to-late afternoon but on some days occurs in early afternoon or even in the morning. An additional advantage of later season storms is that days are considerably longer than in early spring. Morning or early afternoon storms tend to be associated with stronger [[wind shear]] and thus most often happen earlier in the spring season or later during the fall season.\n\nSome organized chasing efforts have also begun in the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]] and in southeastern [[Australia]],<ref>{{cite news |last = McLaughlin |first = Murray  |title = Storm chasers hit Top End |work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |publisher = 7.30 Report |date = 2003-12-17 |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1012266.htm |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Krien |first = Anna |authorlink1=Anna Krien|title = Weather from hell is heaven on earth for storm troops |work = Fairfax Digital |publisher = The Age |date = 2004-07-04 |url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/03/1088488200242.html |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}</ref> with the biggest successes in November and December. A handful of individuals are also known to be chasing in other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Argentina]], [[South Africa]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[New Zealand]]; although many people trek to the Great Plains of [[North America]] from these and other countries around the world (especially from the UK). The number of chasers and number countries where chasers are active expanded at an accelerating pace in Europe from the 1990s\u20132010s.\n\n==Dangers==\nThere are inherent dangers involved in pursuing hazardous weather. These range from lightning, tornadoes, large hail, flooding, hazardous road conditions (rain or hail-covered roadways), animals on the roadway, downed power lines (and occasionally other debris), reduced visibility from heavy rain (often wind blown), blowing [[Dust storm|dust]], and [[hail fog]]. Most directly weather-related hazards such as from a tornado are minimized if the storm chaser is knowledgeable and cautious. In some situations severe [[downburst]] winds may push automobiles around, especially high-profile vehicles. Tornadoes affect a relatively small area and are predictable enough to be avoided if sustaining [[situational awareness]] and following strategies including always having an open escape route, maintaining a safe distance, and avoiding placement in the direction of travel of a tornado (in most cases in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] this is to the north and to the east of a tornado). Lightning, however, is an unavoidable hazard. \"Core punching\", storm chaser slang for driving through a heavy precipitation core to intercept the area of interest within a storm, is recognized as hazardous due to reduced visibility and because many tornadoes are rain-wrapped. The \"bear's cage\" refers to the area under a rotating [[wall cloud]] (and any attendant tornadoes), which is the \"bear\", and to the blinding precipitation (which can include window-shatteringly large hail) surrounding some or all sides of a tornado, which is the \"cage\". Similarly, chasing at night heightens risk due to darkness.<ref name=\"Storm Talk\">{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Tim |authorlink=Timothy P. Marshall |others=David Hoadley (illust.) |title=Storm Talk |date=May 1995 |location= }}</ref>\n\nIn reality, the most significant hazard is [[driving]],<ref name=\"Storm Talk\"/><ref name=\"Doswell ethics\"/> which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple [[Distracted driving|distractions]] which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, [[Defensive driving|prudence]] is key to [[Road traffic safety|minimizing]] the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from [[Human multitasking|multitasking]] either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things if he or she is chasing alone. Falling [[Sleep-deprived driving|asleep]] while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the [[Fatigue (safety)|defatigating demands]] of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book |last= Vasquez |first= Tim |authorlink= |title= Storm Chasing Handbook |publisher= Weather Graphics Technologies |edition= 2nd |year= 2008 |location= Garland, TX |url= http://weathergraphics.com/chasing/ |isbn= 978-0-9706840-8-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book |last= Marshall |first= Tim |authorlink= Timothy P.

The first in-field technology consisted of radio gear for communication. Much of this equipment could also be adapted to receive [[radiofax]] data which was useful for receiving basic observational and analysis data. The primary users of such technology were university or government research groups who often had larger budgets than individual chasers.\n\nRadio scanners were also heavily used to listen in on [[emergency service]]s and storm spotters so as to determine where the most active or dangerous weather was located. A number of chasers were also [[Amateur radio operator|radio amateurs]], and used mobile (or portable) [[amateur radio]] to communicate directly with spotters and other chasers, allowing them to keep abreast of what they could not themselves see.\n\nIt was not until the mid- to late 1980s that the evolution of the [[laptop]] computer would begin to revolutionize storm chasing. Early on, some chasers carried [[acoustic coupler]]s to download batches of raw surface and upper air data from payphones. The technology was too slow for graphical imagery such as [[Weather radar|radar]] and [[Weather satellite|satellite]] data; and during the first years this wasn't available on any connection over telephone lines, anyway. Some raw data could be downloaded and plotted by software, such as [[surface weather observation]]s using ''WeatherGraphix''<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.weathergraphics.com/dl/|title=Software Download Center - Weather Graphics|website=www.weathergraphics.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> (predecessor to ''Digital Atmosphere'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weathergraphics.com/da/|title=Digital Atmosphere - Weather Graphics|website=www.weathergraphics.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> and similar software or for upper air soundings using ''SHARP'',<ref name=\"auto\"/> ''RAOB'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://raob.com/|title=RAOB: The Universal RAwinsonde OBservation program|website=raob.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> <!-- http://www.weathergraphics.com/raob/ --> and similar software.\n\nMost meteorological data was acquired all at once early in the morning, and the rest of day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; as well as on visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted [[weather map]]s were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. [[NOAA Weather Radio]] (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|weather watches and warning]]s, surface weather conditions, [[Storm Prediction Center#Convective outlooks|convective outlook]]s, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use high-speed Internet access available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.\n\nWith the development of the mobile computers, the first computer mapping software became feasible, at about the same time as the popular adoption of the [[VHS]] [[camcorder]] began a rapid growth phase. Prior to the mid to late 1980s most motion picture equipment consisted of [[8 mm film]] cameras. While the quality of the first VHS consumer cameras was quite poor (and the size somewhat cumbersome) when compared to traditional film formats, the amount of [[Videotape|video]] which could be shot with a minimal amount of resources was much greater than any [[Film stock|film format]] at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s [[The Weather Channel]] (TWC) and ''[[A.M. Weather]]'' were popular with chasers, in the morning preceding a chase for the latter and both before and during a chase for the former. Commercial radio sometimes also provides weather and damage information. The 1990s brought technological leaps and bounds. With the swift development of [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] technology, television sets for example could be installed with ease in most vehicles allowing storm chasers to actively view local TV stations. Mobile phones became popular making group coordination easier when traditional radio communications methods were not ideal or for those possessing radios. The development of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) in 1993 hastened adoption of the Internet and led to [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] access to some of the first university weather sites.\n\nThe mid-1990s marked the development of smaller more efficient marine radars. While such marine radars are illegal if used in land-mobile situations, a number of chasers were quick to adopt them in an effort to have mobile radar. These radars have been found to interfere with research radars, such as the [[Doppler on Wheels]] (DOW) utilized in field projects. The first personal [[lightning detection]] and mapping devices also became available<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boltek.com/|title=Boltek &#124; Lightning Detection Systems|website=www.boltek.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> and the first online radar data was offered by private corporations or, at first with delays, with free services. A popular data vendor by the end of the 1990s was [[WeatherTAP]].\n\n===Current===\n[[File:Tornado intercept vehicle.jpg|{{largethumb}}|A heavily armored [[Tornado Intercept Vehicle]] used to film inside a tornado with an [[IMAX]] camera, and featured in the Discovery Channel series, [[Storm Chasers (TV series)|''Storm Chasers'']].]]\n[[File:SRV Dominator 2 crop.jpg|{{largethumb}}|An SRV, a.k.a. [[SRV Dominator|\"The Dominator\"]], featured in the Discovery Channel series, [[Storm Chasers (TV series)|''Storm Chasers'']].]]\n\nChasers used paper [[Road map|maps]] for navigation and some of those now using GPS still use these as a backup or for strategizing with other chasers. Foldable state maps can be used but are cumbersome due to the multitude of states needed and only show major roads. National atlases allow more detail and all states are contained in a single book, with [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] favored and [[Rand McNally]] followed by [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] also used. The preferred atlases due to great detail in rural areas are the \"''Roads of...''\" series originally by Shearer Publishing, which first included Texas but expanded to other states such as Oklahoma and Colorado. Covering every state of the union are the [[DeLorme]] \"Atlas and Gazetteer\" series. DeLorme also produced early GPS receivers that connected to laptops and for years was one of two major mapping software creators. ''DeLorme Street Atlas USA'' or ''[[Microsoft Streets & Trips]]'' were used by most chasers until their discontinuations in 2013. Chasers now use [[Google Maps]] or other [[web mapping]] as no suitable alternative mapping software emerged. GPS receivers may still be used with other software, such as for displaying radar data.\n\nA major turning point was the advent of civilian [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] in 1996. At first, GPS units were very costly and only offered basic functions, but that would soon change. Towards the late 1990s the Internet was awash in weather data and free weather software, the first true cellular Internet modems for consumer use also emerged providing chasers access to data in the field without having to rely on a nowcaster. The NWS also released the first free, up-to-date [[NEXRAD]] Level 3 radar data. In conjunction with all of this, GPS units now had the ability to connect with computers, granting greater ease when navigating.\n\n2001 marked the next great technological leap for storm chasers as the first [[Wi-Fi]] units began to emerge offering wireless broadband service in many cases for free. Some places (restaurants, motels, libraries, etc.) were known to reliably offer wireless access and [[wardriving]] located other availabilities. In 2002 the first [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based package to combine GPS positioning and Doppler radar appeared called SWIFT WX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherdefender.com/|title=Weather Defender - Weather software, live weather radar for your desktop.|website=www.weatherdefender.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> SWIFT WX allowed storm chasers to seamlessly position themselves accurately relative to tornadic storms.\n\nIn 2004 two more storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, was a new [[XM Satellite Radio]] based system<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wxworx.com/|title=WxWorx &#124; Pilot & Marine Weather &#124; Storm Chasers &#124; Huntsville, AL|website=WxWorx Store|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> utilizing a special receiver and [[Baron Services]] weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant that even in the most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grlevelx.com/|title=GRLevelX Main Page|website=www.grlevelx.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> [[GRLevelX|GRLevel3]] utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true [[Vector graphics|vector]] format with [[Geographic information system|GIS]] layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using [[Spotter Network]] (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.\n\nThe most common chaser communications device is the [[Mobile phone|cellular phone]]. These are used for both voice and data connections. External antennas and amplifiers may be used to boost signal transception. It is not uncommon that chasers travel in small groups of cars, and they may use [[Citizens Band radio|CB radio]] (declining in use) or inexpensive [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS]] / [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] hand-held [[transceiver]]s for inter-vehicle communication. More commonly, many chasers are also ham radio operators and use the [[2-meter band|2 meters]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and, less often, [[70-centimeter band|70 cm]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands to communicate between vehicles or with [[Skywarn]] / [[Canwarn]] spotter networks. [[Scanner (radio)|Scanners]] are often used to monitor spotter, sometimes public safety communications, and can double as [[weather radio]]s. Since the mid-2000s [[social networking services]] may also be used, with [[Twitter]] most used for ongoing events, [[Facebook]] for sharing images and discussing chase reports, and [[Instagram]] trailing in adoption. Social networking services largely (but not completely) replace forums and email lists, which complemented and eventually supplanted ''Stormtrack'' magazine, for conversing about storms.\n\nIn-field environmental data is still popular among some storm chasers, especially [[temperature]], moisture, and [[wind speed]] and [[Wind direction|direction]] data. Many have chosen to mount weather stations atop their vehicles. Others use handheld [[anemometer]]s. Rulers or baseballs may be brought along for measuring hail and for showing as a comparison object. Vehicle mounted cameras, such as on the roof or more commonly on the dash, provide continuous visual recording capability.\n\nChasers heavily utilized still [[photography]] since the beginning. [[Videography]] gained prominence by the 1990s into the early 2000s but a resurgence of photography occurred with the advent of affordable and versatile [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR]] (DSLR) [[Still camera|cameras]]. Prior to this, [[35mm format|35 mm]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[Photographic film|print]] and [[Reversal film|slide]] [[film format]]s were mostly used, along with some [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] cameras. In the late 2000s, mobile phone [[3G]] data networks became fast enough to allow [[live streaming]] video from chasers using webcams. This live imagery is frequently used by the media, as well as NWS meteorologists, emergency managers, and the general public for direct ground truth information, and it promotes video sales opportunities for chasers. Also by this time, camcorders using [[memory card]]s to record video began to be adopted. [[DV|Digital video]] had been around for years but was recorded on [[Magnetic tape|tape]], whereas [[Solid-state storage|solid-state]] is [[random access]] rather than [[sequential access]] (linear) and has no moving parts. Late in the 2000s [[High-definition video|HD video]] began to overtake [[Standard-definition television|SD]] (which had been [[NTSC]] in North America) in usage as prices came down and performance increased (initially there were low-light and sporadic aliasing problems due to chip and sensor limitations). By the mid-2010s [[4K resolution|4K]] cameras were increasingly in use. [[Tripod (photography)|Tripods]] are used by those seeking crisp professional photo and video imagery and also enable chasers to tend to other activities. Other accessories include cable/remote shutter releases, lightning triggers, and lens filters. Windshield mounted cameras or dome enclosed cameras atop vehicle roofs may also be used, and a few chasers use [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] (\"drones\").\n\nLate in the 2000s [[smartphone]]s increased in usage, with radar viewing applications frequently used. Particularly, ''RadarScope''<ref>http://www.basevelocity.com/</ref> on the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms is favored. ''Pkyl3''<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pykl3radar.com/|title=PYKL3 Radar|website=www.pykl3radar.com|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> was a dominant early choice on Android devices which discontinued development in August 2018.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other apps may be used as are browsers for viewing meteorological data and accessing social networking services. Some handsets can be used as [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|WiFi hotspots]] and wireless cards may also be used to avoid committing a handset to [[tethering]] or operating as a hotspot. Some hotspots operate as [[mobile broadband]] [[Mobile virtual network operator|MNVO]] devices using any radio spectrum that is both available and is in contract with a service provider. Such devices may expand mobile data range beyond a single carrier's service area and typically can work on month-to-month contracts. Adoption of [[tablet computer]]s expanded by the early 2010s. [[LTE (telecommunication)|4G LTE]] has been adopted when available and can be especially useful for uploading HD video. A gradual uptick of those selecting [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]]s (MILCs) began in the mid-2010s. Usage of DSLR for video capture, called HDSLR, is common, although HD camcorders remain popular due to their greater functionality (many chasers still shoot both).\n\nChasers also carry common travel articles and vehicle maintenance items, and sometimes [[first aid kit]]s. Full sized [[spare tire]]s are strongly preferable to \"donut\" emergency replacement tires. [[Power inverter]]s (often with [[Surge protector|surged protected]] [[power strips]]) power devices that require [[Alternating current|AC]] (indoor/wall outlet) power, although some devices may be powered directly with [[Direct current|DC]] (battery power) from the vehicle electric system. Water repellent products, such as [[Rain-X]] or [[Aquapel (glass treatment)|Aquapel]], are frequently applied to windshields to dispel water when driving as well as mud and small detritus, which boosts visibility and image clarity on photographs and videos shot through glass (which is particularly problematic if [[autofocus]] is on). [[Binoculars]] and sunglasses are commonly employed.\n\n==Ethics==\nA growing number of experienced storm chasers advocate the adoption of a code of [[ethics]] in storm chasing featuring safety, courtesy, and objectivity as the backbone.<ref name=\"Doswell ethics\">{{cite web |last=Doswell III  |first=Charles A.  |title=Storm Chasing with Safety, Courtesy, and Responsibility  |url=http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/chasesums/Chase_safety.html  |publisher=Michael Graff  |access-date=21 April 2008  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121113806/http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/chasesums/Chase_safety.html  |archive-date=21 January 2009  |date=4 April 2009  |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Moller  |first=Alan |authorlink= Alan Moller  |title=Storm Chase Ethics  |journal=Storm Track  |volume=15  |issue=3  |pages=8\u20139  |date=Mar 1992  |url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~stumpf/cethics.html }}</ref> Storm chasing is a highly visible recreational activity (which is also associated with [[science]]) that is vulnerable to sensationalist media promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stormtrack.org/library/faq/|title=The Online Storm Chasing FAQ by Roger Edwards and Tim Vasquez|website=stormtrack.org|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> Veteran storm chasers [[Charles A.
