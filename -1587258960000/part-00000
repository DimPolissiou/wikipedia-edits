With few exceptions, animals [[Heterotroph|consume organic material]], [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|breathe oxygen]], are [[Motility|able to move]], can [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the [[blastula]], during [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Over 1.5 million [[Extant taxon|living]] animal [[species]] have been [[Species description|described]]\u2014of which around 1 million are [[Insecta|insects]]\u2014but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5&nbsp;millionths of a metre to {{convert|33.6|m|ft}}. They have [[Ecology|complex interactions]] with each other and their environments, forming intricate [[food web]]s. The kingdom Animalia includes [[human]]s, but in colloquial use the term ''animal'' often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as [[zoology]].\n\nMost living animal species are in the [[Bilateria]], a [[clade]] whose members have a [[Symmetry in biology#Bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]] body plan. The Bilateria include the [[protostomes]]\u2014in which many groups of [[invertebrate]]s are found, such as [[nematode]]s, [[arthropod]]s, and [[mollusc]]s\u2014and the [[deuterostomes]], containing both the [[echinoderm]]s as well as the [[chordate]]s, the latter containing the [[vertebrate]]s. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the [[Ediacaran biota]] of the late [[Precambrian]]. Many modern animal [[Phylum|phyla]] became clearly established in the [[fossil record]] as [[Marine life|marine species]] during the [[Cambrian explosion]], which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of [[gene]]s common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single [[Animal#Phylogeny|common ancestor]] that lived [[Cryogenian|650 million years ago]].\n\nHistorically, [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle divided animals]] into those with blood and those without. [[Carl Linnaeus]] created the first hierarchical [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] for animals in 1758 with his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', which [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] expanded into 14 [[Phylum|phyla]] by 1809. In 1874, [[Ernst Haeckel]] divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular '''Metazoa''' ([[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] for Animalia) and the [[Protozoa]], single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as [[molecular phylogenetics]], which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between animal [[Taxon|taxa]].\n\nHumans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[egg]]s), for materials (such as [[leather]] and [[wool]]), and also as [[pet]]s, and for transports, as [[working animal]]s. Dogs have been [[Hunting dog|used in hunting]], while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animal\" comes from the Latin ''{{wiktlat |animalis}}'', meaning ''having breath'', ''having soul'' or ''living being''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cresswell |first=Julia |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-19-954793-7 |quote='having the breath of life', from anima 'air, breath, life'.}}</ref> The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.<ref name=americanheritage_animal>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Animal |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |edition=4th}}</ref> In colloquial usage, as a consequence of [[anthropocentrism]], the term ''animal'' is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human animals.<ref>{{cite web |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |title=animal |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/animal |access-date=26 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726233938/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/animal |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Boly |first=Melanie |last2=Seth |first2=Anil K. |last3=Wilke |first3=Melanie |last4=Ingmundson |first4=Paul |last5=Baars |first5=Bernard |last6=Laureys |first6=Steven |last7=Edelman |first7=David |last8=Tsuchiya |first8=Naotsugu |date=2013 |title=Consciousness in humans and non-human animals: recent advances and future directions |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=4 |pages=625 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00625 |pmc=3814086 |pmid=24198791}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |website=Royal Society |url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2004/non-human-animals/ |title=The use of non-human animals in research |access-date=7 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140908/https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2004/non-human-animals/ |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nonhuman |title=Nonhuman definition and meaning {{!}} |website=Collins English Dictionary |access-date=7 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142932/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nonhuman |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Blastulation.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Animals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early [[embryo]] (1) develop into a hollow ball or [[blastula]] (2).]]\n\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.

The body is [[Triploblasty|<!--this is the primary location for this wikilink-->triploblastic]], with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues [[Organogenesis|form distinct organs]]. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a [[coelom]] or pseudocoelom. Animals with this bilaterally symmetric [[body plan]] and a tendency to move in one direction have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior) as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly (ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side.<ref name=\"Minelli2009\"/><ref name=Brusca2016/>\n\nHaving a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring [[cephalisation]], the development of a head with [[sense organ]]s and a mouth.

With few exceptions, animals [[Heterotroph|consume organic material]], [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|breathe oxygen]], are [[Motility|able to move]], can [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the [[blastula]], during [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Over 1.5 million [[Extant taxon|living]] animal [[species]] have been [[Species description|described]]\u2014of which around 1 million are [[Insecta|insects]]\u2014but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5&nbsp;millionths of a metre to {{convert|33.6|m|ft}}. They have [[Ecology|complex interactions]] with each other and their environments, forming intricate [[food web]]s. The kingdom Animalia includes [[human]]s, but in colloquial use the term ''animal'' often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as [[zoology]].\n\nMost living animal species are in the [[Bilateria]], a [[clade]] whose members have a [[Symmetry in biology#Bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]] body plan. The Bilateria include the [[protostomes]]\u2014in which many groups of [[invertebrate]]s are found, such as [[nematode]]s, [[arthropod]]s, and [[mollusc]]s\u2014and the [[deuterostomes]], containing both the [[echinoderm]]s as well as the [[chordate]]s, the latter containing the [[vertebrate]]s. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the [[Ediacaran biota]] of the late [[Precambrian]]. Many modern animal [[Phylum|phyla]] became clearly established in the [[fossil record]] as [[Marine life|marine species]] during the [[Cambrian explosion]], which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of [[gene]]s common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single [[Animal#Phylogeny|common ancestor]] that lived [[Cryogenian|650 million years ago]].\n\nHistorically, [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle divided animals]] into those with blood and those without. [[Carl Linnaeus]] created the first hierarchical [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] for animals in 1758 with his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', which [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] expanded into 14 [[Phylum|phyla]] by 1809. In 1874, [[Ernst Haeckel]] divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular '''Metazoa''' ([[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] for Animalia) and the [[Protozoa]], single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as [[molecular phylogenetics]], which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between animal [[Taxon|taxa]].\n\nHumans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[egg]]s), for materials (such as [[leather]] and [[wool]]), and also as [[pet]]s, and for transports, as [[working animal]]s. Dogs have been [[Hunting dog|used in hunting]], while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animal\" comes from the Latin ''{{wiktlat |animalis}}'', meaning ''having breath'', ''having soul'' or ''living being''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cresswell |first=Julia |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-19-954793-7 |quote='having the breath of life', from anima 'air, breath, life'.}}</ref> The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.<ref name=americanheritage_animal>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Animal |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |edition=4th}}</ref> In colloquial usage, as a consequence of [[anthropocentrism]], the term ''animal'' is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human animals.<ref>{{cite web |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |title=animal |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/animal |access-date=26 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726233938/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/animal |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Boly |first=Melanie |last2=Seth |first2=Anil K. |last3=Wilke |first3=Melanie |last4=Ingmundson |first4=Paul |last5=Baars |first5=Bernard |last6=Laureys |first6=Steven |last7=Edelman |first7=David |last8=Tsuchiya |first8=Naotsugu |date=2013 |title=Consciousness in humans and non-human animals: recent advances and future directions |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=4 |pages=625 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00625 |pmc=3814086 |pmid=24198791}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |website=Royal Society |url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2004/non-human-animals/ |title=The use of non-human animals in research |access-date=7 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140908/https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2004/non-human-animals/ |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nonhuman |title=Nonhuman definition and meaning {{!}} |website=Collins English Dictionary |access-date=7 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142932/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nonhuman |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Blastulation.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Animals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early [[embryo]] (1) develop into a hollow ball or [[blastula]] (2).]]\n\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.

The body is [[Triploblasty|<!--this is the primary location for this wikilink-->triploblastic]], with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues [[Organogenesis|form distinct organs]]. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a [[coelom]] or pseudocoelom. Animals with this bilaterally symmetric [[body plan]] and a tendency to move in one direction have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior) as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly (ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side.<ref name=\"Minelli2009\"/><ref name=Brusca2016/>\n\nHaving a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring [[cephalisation]], the development of a head with [[sense organ]]s and a mouth.

Its territory is crossed by the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] [[Mountain chain|mountains chains]]. Liguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]], and has a population of 1,557,533. The region is part of the [[Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion|Alps-Mediterranean Euroregion]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Liguria'' predates [[Latin]] and is of obscure origin. The Latin [[adjectives]] {{lang|la|Ligusticum}} (as in {{lang|la|Mare Ligusticum}}) and ''Liguscus''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dicolatin.com/|title=DicoLatin|website=DicoLatin}}</ref> reveal the original root of the name, ''ligusc-'': in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of {{lang|la|Liguria}}, according to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]. Compare {{lang-grc|\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03c5\u03c2|translit=L\u00edgus|translation=a Ligurian, a person from Liguria}} whence {{lang|grc-Latn|Ligustik\u1e17}} {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} {{translation|the name of the place Liguria}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ligus&la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The name derives from the ancient [[Ligures]] people, although in reality the territory of this people was much larger than the current administrative region; it included all of North-west Italy south to the [[Po (river)|Po river]], and south-eastern [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome scholars see a possible connection with [[Old European languages]], as the formant -sc- (-sk-) is also present in names like [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Euskadi]] (the [[endonym]] of the Basques), and [[Gascony|Gascon]]. Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples, <ref>Room, \"Placenames of the World,\" 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families respectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used\nof the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Ra\u015bna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Turs\u0113noi''  and ''Tyrr\u0113noi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Toscana''.)\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Spezia monterosso.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of [[Cinque Terre]].]]\nLiguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The narrow strip of land is bordered by the [[Ligurian Sea|sea]], the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains]]. Some mountains rise above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] line runs at an average altitude of about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. The highest point of the region is the summit of [[Monte Saccarello]] ({{convert|2201|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}).\n\nThe winding arched extension goes from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] to [[La Spezia]]. Of this, {{convert|3524.08|km2|2|abbr=on}} are mountainous (65% of the total) and {{convert|891.95|km2|2|abbr=on}} are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.\n\nThe continental shelf is very narrow, and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its {{convert|350|km|adj=on}} coastline. Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged, and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].\n\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Liguria}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman times===\n\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of Roman Liguria, between the River [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]].]]\n[[File:La Ligurie de Mercator 1576.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of ancient Liguria, between the river [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]]. [[Cannes]] is annexed by France in [[Middle Ages]].]]\n[[File:County of nice.svg|250px|thumb|[[County of Nice]] western part of Liguria annexed by France in 1860.]]\n\nAccording to classical sources, the Ligurians ([[Ligures]]) once lived in a far broader territory than present-day Liguria. For example, the Greek colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]], modern [[Marseille]]{{Citation needed|reason=no source mentions this|date=March 2020}}, was recorded to lie in Ligurian territory.\n\n[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD).]]\n\nDuring the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]], others, including the inhabitants of Stalia (later [[Genoa]]), with Rome. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]\n\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops\u2019 power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple).]]\n\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].\n\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquis of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\n\n===Early modern===\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Posthumous portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]\n\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic a relative stability for about 250 years.\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]].]]\n\nGenoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].\n\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]\u2019s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France.  Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[G\u00eanes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].\n\n[[File:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the Sardinian state), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the tragic period of the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat the city has been awarded the gold medal for military valour.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |829000\n|1871 |884000\n|1881 |936000\n|1901 |1086000\n|1911 |1207000\n|1921 |1338000\n|1931 |1423000\n|1936 |1467000\n|1951 |1567000\n|1961 |1735000\n|1971 |1854000\n|1981 |1808000\n|1991 |1676000\n|2001 |1572000\n|2011 |1617000\n|2017 |1557533\n}}\n\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s.

Its territory is crossed by the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] [[Mountain chain|mountains chains]]. Liguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]], and has a population of 1,557,533. The region is part of the [[Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion|Alps-Mediterranean Euroregion]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Liguria'' predates [[Latin]] and is of obscure origin. The Latin [[adjectives]] {{lang|la|Ligusticum}} (as in {{lang|la|Mare Ligusticum}}) and ''Liguscus''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dicolatin.com/|title=DicoLatin|website=DicoLatin}}</ref> reveal the original root of the name, ''ligusc-'': in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of {{lang|la|Liguria}}, according to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]. Compare {{lang-grc|\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03c5\u03c2|translit=L\u00edgus|translation=a Ligurian, a person from Liguria}} whence {{lang|grc-Latn|Ligustik\u1e17}} {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} {{translation|the name of the place Liguria}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ligus&la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The name derives from the ancient [[Ligures]] people, although in reality the territory of this people was much larger than the current administrative region; it included all of North-west Italy south to the [[Po (river)|Po river]], and south-eastern [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome scholars see a possible connection with [[Old European languages]], as the formant -sc- (-sk-) is also present in names like [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Euskadi]] (the [[endonym]] of the Basques), and [[Gascony|Gascon]]. Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples, <ref>Room, \"Placenames of the World,\" 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families respectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used\nof the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Ra\u015bna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Turs\u0113noi''  and ''Tyrr\u0113noi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Toscana''.)\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Spezia monterosso.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of [[Cinque Terre]].]]\nLiguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The narrow strip of land is bordered by the [[Ligurian Sea|sea]], the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains]]. Some mountains rise above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] line runs at an average altitude of about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. The highest point of the region is the summit of [[Monte Saccarello]] ({{convert|2201|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}).\n\nThe winding arched extension goes from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] to [[La Spezia]]. Of this, {{convert|3524.08|km2|2|abbr=on}} are mountainous (65% of the total) and {{convert|891.95|km2|2|abbr=on}} are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.\n\nThe continental shelf is very narrow, and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its {{convert|350|km|adj=on}} coastline. Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged, and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].\n\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Liguria}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman times===\n\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of Roman Liguria, between the River [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]].]]\n[[File:La Ligurie de Mercator 1576.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of ancient Liguria, between the river [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]]. [[Cannes]] is annexed by France in [[Middle Ages]].]]\n[[File:County of nice.svg|250px|thumb|[[County of Nice]] western part of Liguria annexed by France in 1860.]]\n\nAccording to classical sources, the Ligurians ([[Ligures]]) once lived in a far broader territory than present-day Liguria. For example, the Greek colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]], modern [[Marseille]]{{Citation needed|reason=no source mentions this|date=March 2020}}, was recorded to lie in Ligurian territory.\n\n[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD).]]\n\nDuring the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]], others, including the inhabitants of Stalia (later [[Genoa]]), with Rome. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]\n\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops\u2019 power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple).]]\n\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].\n\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquis of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\n\n===Early modern===\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Posthumous portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]\n\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic a relative stability for about 250 years.\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]].]]\n\nGenoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].\n\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]\u2019s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France.  Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[G\u00eanes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].\n\n[[File:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the Sardinian state), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the tragic period of the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat the city has been awarded the gold medal for military valour.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |829000\n|1871 |884000\n|1881 |936000\n|1901 |1086000\n|1911 |1207000\n|1921 |1338000\n|1931 |1423000\n|1936 |1467000\n|1951 |1567000\n|1961 |1735000\n|1971 |1854000\n|1981 |1808000\n|1991 |1676000\n|2001 |1572000\n|2011 |1617000\n|2017 |1557533\n}}\n\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s. In the [[province of Genoa]], it reaches almost 500 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas in the provinces of [[province of imperia|Imperia]] and [[province of savona|Savona]] it is less than 200 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>. The Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]], noting it from sea in 1436, remarked \"To one who does not know it, the whole coast from Savona to Genoa looks like one continuous city, so well inhabited is it, and so thickly studded with houses,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch1|title=Pero Tafur|website=depts.washington.edu}}</ref> and today over 80% of the regional population still lives permanently near to the coast, where all the four major cities above 50,000 are located: [[Genoa]] (pop. 610,000), [[La Spezia]] (pop. 95,000), [[Savona]] (pop. 62,000) and [[Sanremo]] (pop. 56,000).\n\nThe population of Liguria has been declining from 1971 to 2001, most markedly in the cities of Genoa, Savona and La Spezia.

So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding, electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).<ref name=\"regportraits1\"/>\nIn the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.\nA good motorways network ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).\nIn average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region.<ref name=\"regportraits1\"/> The [[Port of Genoa]], with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes <ref name=\"genova1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |title=Autorit\u00e0 Portuale di Genova&nbsp;\u2014 Traffico porto |publisher=Porto.genova.it |date= |accessdate=26 December 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145356/http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |archivedate= 2 December 2008 |df= }}</ref> it is the first port of Italy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20070406_00/inf_07_05_statistiche_trasporti_marittimi_2002_2004.pdf |title=Inf_07_05_Statistiche dei trasporti marittimi 2002\u20132004 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref> the second in terms of [[twenty-foot equivalent units]] after the port of [[transshipment]] of [[Gioia Tauro]], with a trade volume of 1.86 million TEUs.<ref name=\"genova1\"/> The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona and Canary Islands.\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 49.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.8% of Italy's economic output.

===\nOn 2-3 November, al-Hashimi's caliphacy was criticized as illegitimate by the al-Wafa\u2019 Media Agency, an online media outlet previously aligned with ISIL before turning against it in March 2019. It was argued that \"the Prophet decreed obedience to leaders who exist and who are known \u2026 not obedience to a nonentity or an unknown\". Further, it was argued that the council which elected al-Hashimi did not qualify as a legitimate since it lacked 3 qualifications for the caliph\u2019s electors: justice, knowledge, and wisdom - which the council lacked, since it had sent Baghdadi to Idlib, which had earlier deemed by them a \"land of unbelief\", when he \"would have been much safer hiding in the desert\". Further disqualifying the council was the fact that the council had \"shed innocent Muslim blood and embraced extremism in the practice of excommunication\" ([[takfir]]). As a final note, the al-Wafa\u2019 Media Agency stated that nothing was left for a would-be caliph to preside over - \u201cYou do not recognize that God has destroyed your state on account of your oppression.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|title=Caliph Incognito: The Ridicule of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi|last=Succession|first=Caliph Abu Unknown:|last2=says|first2=Legitimacy in the Islamic State-War on the Rocks|website=www.jihadica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102184946/http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|archive-date=2020-01-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, al-Hashimi received pledges of allegiance from ISIL's [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Sinai Province|Sinai province]] (2 Nov), Bangladeshi affiliates (2 Nov), [[Islamic State in Somalia|Somali province]] (3 Nov), Pakistani province (4 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province|Yemen province]] (4 Nov), Hauran province (5 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province|Khorasan Province]] (5 Nov), [[ISIL insurgency in Tunisia|Tunisia province]] (6 Nov), [[Boko Haram|West Africa province]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Homs]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - al-Khayr (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Raqqa]] (7 Nov), [[Abu Sayyaf|East Asia Province]] (7 Nov), [[Islamic State's Central Africa Province|Central Africa Province]] (7 Nov), West Asia Province (8 Nov), West Africa Province - Mali and Burkina Faso (9 Nov), [[Al-Barakah (ISIL administrative district)|Levant Province - al-Barakah]] (9 Nov), Levant Province - Halab (12 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Baghdad]] (14 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|Libya Province]] (15 Nov), Iraq Province - Dijlah (16 Nov), Iraq Province - Diyala (17 Nov), Iraq Province - Salah al-Din (18 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Kirkuk]] (19 Nov), East Asia Province - Indonesia (22 Nov), Azerbaijani affiliates (29 Nov),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|title=The Islamic State's Bayat Campaign|website=jihadology.net|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221213303/https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|archive-date=2019-12-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2020 from ISIL's Malian affiliates (31 Jan).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2020/01/jihadists-in-central-mali-pledge-allegiance-to-new-islamic-state-leader.php |title= Jihadists in central Mali pledge allegiance to new Islamic State leader |author= Caleb weiss |work=Long War Journal |date=31 January 2020 |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> These pledges of allegiance appeared to be intended to illustrate the legitimacy and unanimous acceptance of al-Hashimi, to counter criticism that he was unknown and illegitimate.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nFollowing an attack on the [[Tajikistan\u2013Uzbekistan border]] that killed 17 people on 7 November, the attackers declared allegiance to al-Hashimi prior to the attack, according to journalist [[Rukmini Callimachi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/1192877066116587520|title=1.

2019. It was argued that \"the Prophet decreed obedience to leaders who exist and who are known \u2026 not obedience to a nonentity or an unknown\". Further, it was argued that the council which elected al-Hashimi did not qualify as a legitimate since it lacked 3 qualifications for the caliph\u2019s electors: justice, knowledge, and wisdom - which the council lacked, since it had sent Baghdadi to Idlib, which had earlier deemed by them a \"land of unbelief\", when he \"would have been much safer hiding in the desert\". Further disqualifying the council was the fact that the council had \"shed innocent Muslim blood and embraced extremism in the practice of excommunication\" ([[takfir]]). As a final note, the al-Wafa\u2019 Media Agency stated that nothing was left for a would-be caliph to preside over - \u201cYou do not recognize that God has destroyed your state on account of your oppression.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|title=Caliph Incognito: The Ridicule of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi|last=Succession|first=Caliph Abu Unknown:|last2=says|first2=Legitimacy in the Islamic State-War on the Rocks|website=www.jihadica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102184946/http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|archive-date=2020-01-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, al-Hashimi received pledges of allegiance from ISIL's [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Sinai Province|Sinai province]] (2 Nov), Bangladeshi affiliates (2 Nov), [[Islamic State in Somalia|Somali province]] (3 Nov), Pakistani province (4 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province|Yemen province]] (4 Nov), Hauran province (5 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province|Khorasan Province]] (5 Nov), [[ISIL insurgency in Tunisia|Tunisia province]] (6 Nov), [[Boko Haram|West Africa province]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Homs]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - al-Khayr (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Raqqa]] (7 Nov), [[Abu Sayyaf|East Asia Province]] (7 Nov), [[Islamic State's Central Africa Province|Central Africa Province]] (7 Nov), West Asia Province (8 Nov), West Africa Province - Mali and Burkina Faso (9 Nov), [[Al-Barakah (ISIL administrative district)|Levant Province - al-Barakah]] (9 Nov), Levant Province - Halab (12 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Baghdad]] (14 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|Libya Province]] (15 Nov), Iraq Province - Dijlah (16 Nov), Iraq Province - Diyala (17 Nov), Iraq Province - Salah al-Din (18 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Kirkuk]] (19 Nov), East Asia Province - Indonesia (22 Nov), Azerbaijani affiliates (29 Nov),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|title=The Islamic State's Bayat Campaign|website=jihadology.net|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221213303/https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|archive-date=2019-12-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2020 from ISIL's Malian affiliates (31 Jan).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2020/01/jihadists-in-central-mali-pledge-allegiance-to-new-islamic-state-leader.php |title= Jihadists in central Mali pledge allegiance to new Islamic State leader |author= Caleb weiss |work=Long War Journal |date=31 January 2020 |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> These pledges of allegiance appeared to be intended to illustrate the legitimacy and unanimous acceptance of al-Hashimi, to counter criticism that he was unknown and illegitimate.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nFollowing an attack on the [[Tajikistan\u2013Uzbekistan border]] that killed 17 people on 7 November, the attackers declared allegiance to al-Hashimi prior to the attack, according to journalist [[Rukmini Callimachi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/1192877066116587520|title=1.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n=== Major companies ===\n\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n[[File:Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac.jpg|250px|thumb|Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac]]\n*[[Arena (swimwear)|Arena]]\n*[[Groupe Bernard]]\n*[[Groupe Castel]]\n*[[Cdiscount]]\n*[[Dassault Group|Dassault]]\n*[[Jock (company)|Jock]]\n*[[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]]\n*[[McKesson Corporation]]\n*[[Oxbow (surfwear)|Oxbow]]\n*[[Pernod Ricard|Ricard]]\n*[[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi Aventis]]\n*[[Smurfit Kappa]]\n*[[Snecma|SNECMA]]\n*[[Solectron]]\n*[[Thales Group]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Population ==\n\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

{{IPA-oc|bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].\n\nThe municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

It took place on the same day as other district council elections in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThese were the first elections to the new district council, which would come into effect on 1 April 1974. The previous all-Cardiff elections to the old [[Cardiff City Council, 1905-1974|Cardiff City Council]] took place [[1972 Cardiff City Council election|in May 1972]].

This followed local government reorganisation enacted by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].

In May 1973 all ward councillors were elected at the same election, to sit for three years.\n\n==Wards==\nThe wards to the new council remained the same in 1973 as the previous Cardiff City Council, but with the addition of two new wards: Lisvane, Llanedeyrn and St Mellons (1 seat); and Radyr, St Fagans, Tongwynlais (2 seats). Fourteen of the wards continued to have three councillors, but five wards had their representation doubled to six councillors.\n\nThe position of [[alderman]] was to be abolished, with all members of the new council being elected ward councillors.\n\n==Results==\nContests took place in all except one of the wards at this election.<ref name=\"Elections Centre\">{{cite web|title=Cardiff Welsh District Council Election Results 1973-1991|url=http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cardiff-1973-1991.pdf |publisher=The Elections Centre ([[Plymouth University]]) |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SWE results\">{{cite news|title=The New District Councils - Election Results - S.

It took place on the same day as other district council elections in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThese were the first elections to the new district council, which would come into effect on 1 April 1974. The previous all-Cardiff elections to the old [[Cardiff City Council, 1905-1974|Cardiff City Council]] took place [[1972 Cardiff City Council election|in May 1972]]. Future elections would take place every three years, with the next election scheduled for [[1976 Cardiff City Council election|6 May 1976]]. \n{{TOC right}}\n\nThe 1973 election saw the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] win a significant majority on the Council.\n\n==Background==\nPreviously a unitary authority from 1889, Cardiff's council was to become a second-tier district authority to [[South Glamorgan County Council]] from 1 April 1974. This followed local government reorganisation enacted by the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. The 1973 election was the first to the new local authority, with councillors acting in a shadow capacity until April 1974.<ref name=\"SWE carve out\" /> The [[1973 South Glamorgan County Council election|election to South Glamorgan County Council]] had taken place in April 1973, with many Cardiff councillors standing for election to this authority. \n\nUntil 1973, elections to Cardiff City Council had been annual, with each of the three ward councillors standing down for election in rotation. In May 1973 all ward councillors were elected at the same election, to sit for three years.\n\n==Wards==\nThe wards to the new council remained the same in 1973 as the previous Cardiff City Council, but with the addition of two new wards: Lisvane, Llanedeyrn and St Mellons (1 seat); and Radyr, St Fagans, Tongwynlais (2 seats). Fourteen of the wards continued to have three councillors, but five wards had their representation doubled to six councillors.\n\nThe position of [[alderman]] was to be abolished, with all members of the new council being elected ward councillors.\n\n==Results==\nContests took place in all except one of the wards at this election.<ref name=\"Elections Centre\">{{cite web|title=Cardiff Welsh District Council Election Results 1973-1991|url=http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cardiff-1973-1991.pdf |publisher=The Elections Centre ([[Plymouth University]]) |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SWE results\">{{cite news|title=The New District Councils - Election Results - S.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the [[United States]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[East India|Eastern India]], but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern [[Canada]] during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Australia]]. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of [[severe weather]], including strong [[thunderstorm]]s, strong winds, and [[hail]].\n\nIn 2006, there were 1,333 reported tornadoes in the US (of which 1,103 tornadoes were confirmed), with 67 reported fatalities (about half of those recorded in [[Tennessee]]).<ref>http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/tornado06.pdf</ref> In addition, four other tornado-related deaths were reported in Europe - all of them in [[Germany]] where 119 tornadoes were confirmed,<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914152425/http://www.tornadoliste.de/tornadoliste2006.htm Tornadoliste Deutschland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 12 deaths in [[Japan]], eight deaths in [[China]], three deaths in [[Vietnam]], and one tornado fatality has been reported in [[Canada]], in the province of [[Manitoba]] for a worldwide total of 94.\n\n==Synopsis==\nNovember 2005 was very active for tornadoes across the United States, with three large outbreaks and one additional significant tornado (see the [[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]). For much of December 2005; a cold, stable [[Arctic]] [[air mass]] prevailed over much of the United States east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. However, by the start of the new year the pattern began to reverse itself, and moist, unstable air once again flowed northward from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (a pattern normally reserved for spring) and combined with a series of strong [[low pressure systems]] tracking across the country, conditions were present for tornado formation.\n\nThe formation had led to an enormous upswing in tornado activity in the early spring, and the tornado reports were at record pace, with nearly continuous activity for an eight-week period throughout March and April, similar to the pace of [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] activity in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]].\n\nActivity slowed down in May with fewer tornadoes overall spread out over a much larger area due to less favorable conditions. The air became somewhat more stable and wind shear decreased, despite the large number of storms that tracked across the US. Since then, activity has been generally fairly low, with no major outbreaks anywhere in the summer of 2006, although the actual number of tornadoes has been moderate. However, in [[Canada]] a series of strong low pressure systems, combined with high heat and humidity had led to numerous severe weather events across the country with several tornadoes occurring in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].\n\nThe fall severe weather season began unusually early, with a moderate event in mid-September followed by a significant outbreak in the latter part of the month. After that, activity slowed down with few significant tornadoes in October and early November. However, several significant events took place in the second half of November into December, to end 2006.\n\nThe most severe tornadoes reported were two F4 tornadoes. They took place on March 12 in [[Monroe City, Missouri]] and on September 22 in [[Crosstown, Missouri]]. The deadliest single tornado was on April 2 in [[Newbern, Tennessee]] where 16 people were killed (out of 29 in the outbreak). The most destructive tornado outside the US was on November 7 in [[Saroma, Hokkaido]], Japan, where nine people died.\n\n==Events==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 1103\n|F0 = 686\n|F1 = 292\n|F2 = 93\n|F3 = 30\n|F4 = 2\n|F5 = 0\n\n|Enhanced=no\n\n}}\n\n===January===\nThere were 43 tornadoes reported in the US in January.

Two major clusters of tornadic [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed, one in central [[Kentucky]] and one in western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. 19 confirmed tornadoes touched down. This outbreak produced a few strong tornadoes, including an F2 that hit the west side of [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]]. An F3 caused major damage near [[Zebulon, Georgia]] as well. Fortunately there were only a few minor injuries.\n\nDamages from the tornadoes totaled $7.452 million.\n{{clear}}\n\n====January 11====\n{{Infobox storm\n|event=January 11\n|fujitascale=F1\n|enhanced=\n|tornadoes=2\n|areas affected=[[Virginia]]\n}}\n{{Tornado chart small| F0 = 0| F1 = 2| F2 = 0| F3 = 0| F4 = 0| F5 = 0| Enhanced = }}\n\nIn the final review of 2006, two isolated tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in [[Virginia]].

A rotating [[supercell]] embedded within the squall line produced an F2 tornado in [[Yell County, Arkansas]]. The next day, several tornadoes developed from supercells that evolved from the remnants of the squall line across the southeastern states, with the first tornado-inflicted death of 2006 in an F1 tornado near [[Belleville, Alabama]] as well as about a dozen students injured at a damaged school in [[Baker, Florida]].

The western suburbs, particularly [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]], took most of the hits. Several homes were heavily damaged, most of them already damaged by Katrina but suffering additional damage. [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|Louis Armstrong International Airport]] took a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, which caused more damage than was done by the hurricane several months earlier.

Over those five days, there were 99 tornadoes confirmed out of as many as 160 tornadoes reported. 27 of them were considered \"strong\" (F2-F3) and one was considered \"violent\" (F4-F5) The majority (62) of the tornadoes occurred on March 12, particularly in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. At least 12 deaths were blamed on the severe weather,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} 10 as a result of tornadoes.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\">[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/2006deadlytorn.html 2006 Tornado Fatality Information] [[Storm Prediction Center]].

At least two people were killed that day in storms, but not in tornadoes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There was little activity on March 10, but it picked up again on March 11 with 18 tornadoes in the mid-[[Mississippi Valley]].  Two people were killed near [[Saint Mary, Missouri]] when their truck was thrown into a propane tank.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/>\n\nThe main outbreak took place on March 12, with at least 62 tornadoes, including most of the strong tornadoes and the only violent one, and eight fatalities.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> Activity continued farther south over [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] on March 13 with 15 weak (F0-F1) tornadoes before the outbreak finally ended.\n\n====March 19\u201320====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[South Central United States]] on March 19 and March 20, with one tornado in [[Texas]] and several in [[Mississippi]] and [[Oklahoma]].\n\nThe strongest tornado (and first of the event) took place in [[Uvalde, Texas]] late on March 19, where an F2 tornado touched down. Severe damage was reported in the community, and several homes were destroyed, including mobile homes. Remarkably, no injuries were reported. The tornado damage was difficult to distinguish from the damage reported as a result of [[microburst]]s in the area which had winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h). It was the strongest tornado in the region since October 2001.\n\nA total of six tornadoes were reported on March 20. Two took place in Oklahoma and four in Mississippi. All were rated F0 or F1 and damage was generally minor.\n\n====March 23====\n\nAn extremely rare tornado touched down in [[Hawaii]] late on March 23, on the island of [[Lanai]]. It occurred at about 9:35&nbsp;p.m. [[Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Time|HAST]] (0735 UTC), and little damage was reported from the F0 tornado. It was only notable because of its unusual location.\n\nTornadoes are very rare in Hawaii; since 1950 there have been only 34 tornadoes in the state. The strongest was an F2 tornado on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] in 1971.\n\n====March 27 (Europe)====\n\nA line of thunderstorms with some supercells tracked across the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Germany]], spawning tornadoes in Germany, including one that tracked through the southern section of [[Hamburg]] at about 7:00&nbsp;p.m. local time (1700 [[UTC]]) on March 27. The tornadoes killed two people who were caught on [[construction]] [[crane (machine)|crane]]s when the tornado hit. 300,000 people also lost [[electricity]] as a result of the storms. Damage was reported to be significant, including flipped cars and major roof damage to numerous houses.

There were 24 tornadoes reported, of which 12 were confirmed. However, most touched down in rural areas and there have only been isolated damage reports. One person died six months later, and five others were injured. Many more reports of straight-line winds, [[microburst]]s and large hail (as large as [[baseball]]s) were reported.\n\nThere were three tornadoes of note.

Despite considerable threat levels and awareness, only one small tornado was reported on April 1, in [[Pawnee County, Kansas]]. Severe weather was largely restricted to significant microbursts and large hail.<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060401_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060401's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSevere weather quickly picked up on April 2 across a nine-state region. There were no less than 66 confirmed tornadoes. Damage was widespread in dozens of communities, in addition to very strong microbursts of winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) and hail as large as [[softball]]s. The hardest-hit area was [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer]] and [[Gibson County, Tennessee|Gibson]] counties in [[Tennessee]], where at least 24 people were killed.\n\nThere was a moderate risk of severe weather on April 3 in the [[southeastern United States]] as the line was expected to refire. However, no tornadoes were reported, just straight-line wind damage.\n\n====April 6\u20138====\n{{main|Tornado outbreak of April 6\u20138, 2006}}\n\nThe third major tornado outbreak occurred over the Central and Southern United States on April 6 and 7, and lasted into early April 8. At least 62 tornadoes were confirmed out of over 80 reported tornadoes. The hardest hit region was the [[Middle Tennessee]] area, where 10 deaths (seven in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]], three near [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]])<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> and heavy damage were reported. Another fatality was reported in [[Marion County, Alabama]].\n\nThe [[Storm Prediction Center]] had issued a rare high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and 7, with an unprecedented 60% probability of a tornado within 25 miles of a point south of the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] area.<ref>[http://spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2006/day1otlk_20060407_2000.html Storm Prediction Center April 7, 2006 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====April 13\u201319====\n{{main|Easter Week 2006 tornado outbreak sequence}}\n\nOn April 13, a complex of severe thunderstorms formed in eastern [[Iowa]], bringing many reports of large hail along with reports of strong tornadoes, some with debris. It was unexpected, as the SPC issued only a slight risk of severe weather and never issued a [[tornado watch]]. The worst impacts were felt in and around [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], where an F2 caused significant damage.\n\nA steady stream of severe weather occurred for several days in the upper [[Mississippi Valley]], lower [[Great Lakes]], and [[Ohio Valley]] regions over the Easter weekend. A moderate risk of severe weather was in place for Saturday, April 15 in parts of Iowa and [[Nebraska]]. Moderate risks of severe weather were also issued for parts of central [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]] on [[Good Friday]], April 14 and [[Easter Sunday]], April 16. There were five to twenty reports of tornadoes each day.\n\nScattered tornadoes causing relatively light damage continued on April 17, 18, and 19.\n\n====April 21\u201322====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[Deep South]] late in the evening of April 21 and early on April 22 along a cold front. There were several tornadoes reported, but all of them were relatively weak. No injuries were reported.\n\n====April 24====\nOn April 24, a small tornado event spawned at least two tornadoes in northeastern and central [[Oklahoma]], causing some moderate damage particularly around [[Oklahoma City]]. No injuries were reported. There were some spectacular television images captured, including footage of a rare anti-cyclonic tornado in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]].\n\n====April 28\u201329====\nA small tornado event developed primarily in [[Texas]] and southern [[Oklahoma]] on April 28, although it was primarily a derecho event.

Two main clusters - one over [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and the other primarily in [[South Dakota]] - produced a total of 10 reported tornadoes, along with powerful straight-line winds of up to 86&nbsp;mph (139&nbsp;km/h) and hail up to softball-sized. Damage was sporadic in the region, with isolated pockets of varying degrees of damage. No injuries were reported.\n\nSeveral more tornadoes developed on May 3 and again on May 4 across the same regions, but damage was relatively minor.\n\nThe activity became somewhat more severe once again on May 5 across Texas. There were 18 reported tornadoes and many reports of wind and hail damage. One person was injured. A strong storm formed over the [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] area in the late hours of the night of May 5, and early morning hours of May 6. This storm spawned a single tornado with damage rated as an F2 on the [[Fujita Scale]].\n\n====May 9\u201310====\nIn early May 2006, a widespread but mostly minor tornado outbreak took place across portions of the [[United States]]. The event began on the 9th with a few  scattered weak tornadoes touching down in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Alabama]], all of which were rated F0.<ref name=\"Storm Events Database\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?beginDate_mm=05&beginDate_dd=09&beginDate_yyyy=2006&endDate_mm=05&endDate_dd=10&endDate_yyyy=2006&eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&submitbutton=Search&statefips=-999%2CALL |title=Storm Events Database |website=NCDC |publisher=NCDC |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Later that evening, additional tornado activity began to occur in [[Texas]]. An F2 struck the north side of [[Childress, Texas]], resulting in considerable damage. Many trees along the path were snapped and uprooted, roofs of homes were damaged, and sheds were overturned in residential areas. As the tornado struck Childress High School, the gymnasium lost its roof and sustained total collapse of a large brick wall. Three air conditioning units were blown off the roof of the school, and two of them were blown from southeast to northwest, landing 90 to 200 feet from the school. A nearby nursing home was also damaged. At Fair Park, a tennis court was destroyed, several metal light poles were bent and snapped, and a pedestrian bridge that spanned a small lake was ripped from its wooden supports and thrown. An industrial storage building that housed emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with steel beams twisted.

Numerous severe weather events were reported across [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] - primarily damaging wind and hail events - when a storm system crossed the area during these two days.\n\nOn May 31 there were at least 6 reports of tornadoes in Indiana and Illinois with no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. Also, [[Lanark County, Ontario|Lanark County]] in eastern [[Ontario]] had two tornado warnings in a span of 18 hours, with the threat of a strong tornado on the evening of May 30. While damage was reported near [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] southwest of [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]] due to straight-line damaging winds, there were no immediate reports of tornadoes despite rotation inside two distinct supercells detected by radar.\n\n===June===\nThere were 139 confirmed tornadoes in the US in June.\n\n====June 5\u20137====\n\nA low pressure system over the northern Plains and a cold front triggered a small tornado outbreak. 17 tornadoes were reported in the [[Dakotas]], eastern [[Iowa]] and southwestern [[Wisconsin]] during these two days (of which at least seven were confirmed), 14 of them occurring on June 6. Two tornadoes were located near [[Barneveld, Wisconsin]], which was the site of an F5 tornado almost the same day in 1984. Both tornadoes were an F0.<ref>[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=060606_tor June 6, 2006 Tornadoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with damage especially confined to trees, although one home was damaged. There were no reported injuries.  There was another tornado in [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk]] and [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia]] counties in Wisconsin, an [[Fujita scale|F1]].\n\nA separate system had reportedly spawned a tornado which inflicted damage to numerous houses near [[Seymour, Indiana]] north of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], but it was confirmed to have been a [[microburst]].\n\n====June 10====\nMore widespread severe weather occurred in the Central Plains with over 100 reports, mostly wind and hail events including reports of [[hurricane force]] wind-gusts. Tornadoes were confined especially in Nebraska where a mobile home and a barn were damaged and trailer was overturned near [[Gordon, Nebraska]]. There was also significant damage to trees and powerlines in [[New Florence, Missouri]] west of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\n====June 11\u201314: Tropical Storm Alberto====\n{{main|Tropical Storm Alberto (2006)}}\nTropical Storm Alberto made landfall on June 13, but was producing squalls well before then. Alberto's bands produced a small tornado event in the [[southeastern United States]]. There were 16 tornadoes reported; four in [[Florida]], three in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], six in [[South Carolina]] and three in [[North Carolina]]. At least seven of the tornadoes were confirmed; one was an F1 and the rest were F0.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/prodsByState.php?state=SC&prodtype=public Public Information - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One person suffered minor injuries in one of the tornadoes.<ref>\"[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060612_rpts.html SPC Storm Reports for 6/12/06].\" ''[[National Weather Service]]/Storm Prediction Center.''

There were at least 17 wind reports exceeding 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) with significant local damage. The heaviest of the activity occurred in [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. Despite the severity of the storms, only four tornadoes were reported in Kansas and three were confirmed; one was an F0 and the other two were F1, all in [[Sherman County, Kansas|Sherman County]].<ref>[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGLD All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====June 18\u201319====\n\nA warm and humid air mass was covering much of the eastern U.S. as well as [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] during this period of severe weather. With the passage of a [[cold front]] and instability, it created a wide area of severe thunderstorms, some as [[supercell]]s and others as [[squall line]]s, which created numerous damage in several U.S. cities as well as important Canadian cities such as [[Ottawa]], [[Sherbrooke]] and [[Granby, Quebec]].\n\nFirst, an unexpected tornado touched down in [[Hartford, Wisconsin]] in the middle of a rain storm with few other storm reports on June 18. Over 50 buildings were reported to have been damaged. Three people were injured by what turned out to be an F1 tornado.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGRB All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Meanwhile, in [[Pembroke, Ontario]] further to the east, what was possibly a tornado but confirmed as a [[microburst]], several roofs including one from a marina and another one from a large warehouse were blown away during the passage of a [[supercell]] storm.\n\nOn June 19, a widespread severe weather event took place throughout the [[Great Lakes]] region and into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. There were no confirmed tornadoes in the US that day, but two were confirmed in [[Ontario]], Canada. One tornado touched down just north of [[Stratford, Ontario]]; it was an F1 and caused moderate damage. A second tornado near [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] occurred late Sunday evening and also rated F1, with a storage shed completely destroyed.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on Ontario - Special Weather Statements - Environment Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230120330/http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on |date=2006-12-30 }}</ref>\n\n====June 21\u201324====\n\nOn the first day of summer, June 21, a significant severe weather outbreak began to develop in much of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and adjacent areas of [[Ontario]]. The most severe weather took place along the [[Interstate 90|I-90]] corridor and around [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, where tornadoes were reported. Another tornado was reported southwest of [[Detroit]] inside a massive cluster of severe thunderstorms that passed through the area in the early evening. However, the tornado did little damage; most of the damage in southeast Michigan was due to straight-line winds.\n\nAnother area of severe weather spawned numerous possible tornadoes in [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Colorado]], with severe weather reports also occurring in [[Iowa]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Missouri]] and [[Nebraska]].\n\nThree people were injured as a result of a landfalling [[waterspout]] in [[Charlotte County, Florida]] in a separate and isolated event. It also damaged numerous homes and destroyed several mobile homes. It was confirmed that there were two tornadoes; one was an F2 and one was an F0.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KTBW All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMore severe weather took place the following day in areas slightly farther south than the previous day's activity. Again, it was primarily a straight-line wind event, with at least 250 wind reports from [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Kentucky]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[West Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] with additional reports from the [[Carolinas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nA small tornado outbreak occurred in two distinct areas: the Southern Plains and the [[Ohio Valley]]. 19 tornadoes were reported - five of them in [[Elbert County, Colorado]] (one was confirmed, destroying a house under construction), likely from the same supercell and five from northwest Ohio in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and [[Van Wert County, Ohio|Van Wert]] counties. Two of the Van Wert County tornadoes were rated F0 (in [[Willshire, Ohio|Willshire]] and [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]]) and another F1 (also in Willshire) while one of the tornadoes in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen County]] was rated F1 with damage limited to sheds and roofs near [[Beaverdam, Ohio|Beaverdam]].<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060622_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060622's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another F0 would hit Willshire the following day.

Another tornado was reported in [[Notre-Dame du Laus, Quebec]] north of [[Gatineau]] and [[Ottawa]]. However, the multiple tree and trailer damage was caused by a [[microburst]] embedded inside a powerful [[progressive derecho]].\n\nAt least two deaths and numerous injuries were reported; however they resulted from the wider derecho, not the tornado events embedded within it.\n\n====July 19\u201320====\n\nA similar pattern to the previous event shaped up over parts of the [[Upper Midwest]], although the risk of tornadoes was initially declared even greater. The greatest risk on July 19 was over southern [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]], spreading eastward over [[Michigan]], southern [[Ontario]] and into the north-central [[Appalachians]] on July 20. The risk extends as far south as roughly the [[Interstate 70]] corridor.\n\nA moderate risk of severe weather had been declared by the SPC for July 19. A cluster of storms did develop in the late afternoon and early evening hours in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]] with additional activity in Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. Three tornadoes were reported including a [[derecho]] that formed in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] metro area with heavy damage to trees and power lines, knocking out power to over 500,000 people. The other reports came from Illinois. In addition, there have been 80-90 reports of severe wind including reports of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) winds in [[De Soto, Missouri]] and in [[Havana, Illinois]].<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060719_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060719's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSevere weather was quite limited the next day, although significant wind reports with local damage were reported in western and southern [[Quebec]].

Another tornado near [[St. James, Minnesota|St. James]] in [[Cottonwood County, Minnesota|Cottonwood County]] was reported; it was an F1. With the first tornado, one farmhouse was flattened, but it was poorly attached - preventing an F4 according to early surveys. It also destroyed the barns, cornfields and silos surrounding the farmhouse. No injuries were reported. The second tornado left moderate damage - including tearing the roofs of a few houses, although it destroyed a few outbuildings.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the [[United States]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[East India|Eastern India]], but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern [[Canada]] during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Australia]]. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of [[severe weather]], including strong [[thunderstorm]]s, strong winds, and [[hail]].\n\nIn 2006, there were 1,333 reported tornadoes in the US (of which 1,103 tornadoes were confirmed), with 67 reported fatalities (about half of those recorded in [[Tennessee]]).<ref>http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/tornado06.pdf</ref> In addition, four other tornado-related deaths were reported in Europe - all of them in [[Germany]] where 119 tornadoes were confirmed,<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914152425/http://www.tornadoliste.de/tornadoliste2006.htm Tornadoliste Deutschland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 12 deaths in [[Japan]], eight deaths in [[China]], three deaths in [[Vietnam]], and one tornado fatality has been reported in [[Canada]], in the province of [[Manitoba]] for a worldwide total of 94.\n\n==Synopsis==\nNovember 2005 was very active for tornadoes across the United States, with three large outbreaks and one additional significant tornado (see the [[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]). For much of December 2005; a cold, stable [[Arctic]] [[air mass]] prevailed over much of the United States east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. However, by the start of the new year the pattern began to reverse itself, and moist, unstable air once again flowed northward from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (a pattern normally reserved for spring) and combined with a series of strong [[low pressure systems]] tracking across the country, conditions were present for tornado formation.\n\nThe formation had led to an enormous upswing in tornado activity in the early spring, and the tornado reports were at record pace, with nearly continuous activity for an eight-week period throughout March and April, similar to the pace of [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] activity in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]].\n\nActivity slowed down in May with fewer tornadoes overall spread out over a much larger area due to less favorable conditions. The air became somewhat more stable and wind shear decreased, despite the large number of storms that tracked across the US. Since then, activity has been generally fairly low, with no major outbreaks anywhere in the summer of 2006, although the actual number of tornadoes has been moderate. However, in [[Canada]] a series of strong low pressure systems, combined with high heat and humidity had led to numerous severe weather events across the country with several tornadoes occurring in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].\n\nThe fall severe weather season began unusually early, with a moderate event in mid-September followed by a significant outbreak in the latter part of the month. After that, activity slowed down with few significant tornadoes in October and early November. However, several significant events took place in the second half of November into December, to end 2006.\n\nThe most severe tornadoes reported were two F4 tornadoes. They took place on March 12 in [[Monroe City, Missouri]] and on September 22 in [[Crosstown, Missouri]]. The deadliest single tornado was on April 2 in [[Newbern, Tennessee]] where 16 people were killed (out of 29 in the outbreak). The most destructive tornado outside the US was on November 7 in [[Saroma, Hokkaido]], Japan, where nine people died.\n\n==Events==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 1103\n|F0 = 686\n|F1 = 292\n|F2 = 93\n|F3 = 30\n|F4 = 2\n|F5 = 0\n\n|Enhanced=no\n\n}}\n\n===January===\nThere were 43 tornadoes reported in the US in January.

Two major clusters of tornadic [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed, one in central [[Kentucky]] and one in western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. 19 confirmed tornadoes touched down. This outbreak produced a few strong tornadoes, including an F2 that hit the west side of [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]]. An F3 caused major damage near [[Zebulon, Georgia]] as well. Fortunately there were only a few minor injuries.\n\nDamages from the tornadoes totaled $7.452 million.\n{{clear}}\n\n====January 11====\n{{Infobox storm\n|event=January 11\n|fujitascale=F1\n|enhanced=\n|tornadoes=2\n|areas affected=[[Virginia]]\n}}\n{{Tornado chart small| F0 = 0| F1 = 2| F2 = 0| F3 = 0| F4 = 0| F5 = 0| Enhanced = }}\n\nIn the final review of 2006, two isolated tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in [[Virginia]].

A rotating [[supercell]] embedded within the squall line produced an F2 tornado in [[Yell County, Arkansas]]. The next day, several tornadoes developed from supercells that evolved from the remnants of the squall line across the southeastern states, with the first tornado-inflicted death of 2006 in an F1 tornado near [[Belleville, Alabama]] as well as about a dozen students injured at a damaged school in [[Baker, Florida]].

The western suburbs, particularly [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]], took most of the hits. Several homes were heavily damaged, most of them already damaged by Katrina but suffering additional damage. [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|Louis Armstrong International Airport]] took a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, which caused more damage than was done by the hurricane several months earlier.

At least two people were killed that day in storms, but not in tornadoes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There was little activity on March 10, but it picked up again on March 11 with 18 tornadoes in the mid-[[Mississippi Valley]].  Two people were killed near [[Saint Mary, Missouri]] when their truck was thrown into a propane tank.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/>\n\nThe main outbreak took place on March 12, with at least 62 tornadoes, including most of the strong tornadoes and the only violent one, and eight fatalities.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> Activity continued farther south over [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] on March 13 with 15 weak (F0-F1) tornadoes before the outbreak finally ended.\n\n====March 19\u201320====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[South Central United States]] on March 19 and March 20, with one tornado in [[Texas]] and several in [[Mississippi]] and [[Oklahoma]].\n\nThe strongest tornado (and first of the event) took place in [[Uvalde, Texas]] late on March 19, where an F2 tornado touched down. Severe damage was reported in the community, and several homes were destroyed, including mobile homes. Remarkably, no injuries were reported. The tornado damage was difficult to distinguish from the damage reported as a result of [[microburst]]s in the area which had winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h). It was the strongest tornado in the region since October 2001.\n\nA total of six tornadoes were reported on March 20. Two took place in Oklahoma and four in Mississippi. All were rated F0 or F1 and damage was generally minor.\n\n====March 23====\n\nAn extremely rare tornado touched down in [[Hawaii]] late on March 23, on the island of [[Lanai]]. It occurred at about 9:35&nbsp;p.m. [[Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Time|HAST]] (0735 UTC), and little damage was reported from the F0 tornado. It was only notable because of its unusual location.\n\nTornadoes are very rare in Hawaii; since 1950 there have been only 34 tornadoes in the state. The strongest was an F2 tornado on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] in 1971.\n\n====March 27 (Europe)====\n\nA line of thunderstorms with some supercells tracked across the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Germany]], spawning tornadoes in Germany, including one that tracked through the southern section of [[Hamburg]] at about 7:00&nbsp;p.m. local time (1700 [[UTC]]) on March 27. The tornadoes killed two people who were caught on [[construction]] [[crane (machine)|crane]]s when the tornado hit. 300,000 people also lost [[electricity]] as a result of the storms. Damage was reported to be significant, including flipped cars and major roof damage to numerous houses.

There were 24 tornadoes reported, of which 12 were confirmed. However, most touched down in rural areas and there have only been isolated damage reports. One person died six months later, and five others were injured. Many more reports of straight-line winds, [[microburst]]s and large hail (as large as [[baseball]]s) were reported.\n\nThere were three tornadoes of note.

There were no less than 66 confirmed tornadoes. Damage was widespread in dozens of communities, in addition to very strong microbursts of winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) and hail as large as [[softball]]s. The hardest-hit area was [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer]] and [[Gibson County, Tennessee|Gibson]] counties in [[Tennessee]], where at least 24 people were killed.\n\nThere was a moderate risk of severe weather on April 3 in the [[southeastern United States]] as the line was expected to refire. However, no tornadoes were reported, just straight-line wind damage.\n\n====April 6\u20138====\n{{main|Tornado outbreak of April 6\u20138, 2006}}\n\nThe third major tornado outbreak occurred over the Central and Southern United States on April 6 and 7, and lasted into early April 8. At least 62 tornadoes were confirmed out of over 80 reported tornadoes. The hardest hit region was the [[Middle Tennessee]] area, where 10 deaths (seven in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]], three near [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]])<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> and heavy damage were reported. Another fatality was reported in [[Marion County, Alabama]].\n\nThe [[Storm Prediction Center]] had issued a rare high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and 7, with an unprecedented 60% probability of a tornado within 25 miles of a point south of the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] area.<ref>[http://spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2006/day1otlk_20060407_2000.html Storm Prediction Center April 7, 2006 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====April 13\u201319====\n{{main|Easter Week 2006 tornado outbreak sequence}}\n\nOn April 13, a complex of severe thunderstorms formed in eastern [[Iowa]], bringing many reports of large hail along with reports of strong tornadoes, some with debris. It was unexpected, as the SPC issued only a slight risk of severe weather and never issued a [[tornado watch]]. The worst impacts were felt in and around [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], where an F2 caused significant damage.\n\nA steady stream of severe weather occurred for several days in the upper [[Mississippi Valley]], lower [[Great Lakes]], and [[Ohio Valley]] regions over the Easter weekend. A moderate risk of severe weather was in place for Saturday, April 15 in parts of Iowa and [[Nebraska]]. Moderate risks of severe weather were also issued for parts of central [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]] on [[Good Friday]], April 14 and [[Easter Sunday]], April 16. There were five to twenty reports of tornadoes each day.\n\nScattered tornadoes causing relatively light damage continued on April 17, 18, and 19.\n\n====April 21\u201322====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[Deep South]] late in the evening of April 21 and early on April 22 along a cold front. There were several tornadoes reported, but all of them were relatively weak. No injuries were reported.\n\n====April 24====\nOn April 24, a small tornado event spawned at least two tornadoes in northeastern and central [[Oklahoma]], causing some moderate damage particularly around [[Oklahoma City]]. No injuries were reported. There were some spectacular television images captured, including footage of a rare anti-cyclonic tornado in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]].\n\n====April 28\u201329====\nA small tornado event developed primarily in [[Texas]] and southern [[Oklahoma]] on April 28, although it was primarily a derecho event.

Two main clusters - one over [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and the other primarily in [[South Dakota]] - produced a total of 10 reported tornadoes, along with powerful straight-line winds of up to 86&nbsp;mph (139&nbsp;km/h) and hail up to softball-sized. Damage was sporadic in the region, with isolated pockets of varying degrees of damage. No injuries were reported.\n\nSeveral more tornadoes developed on May 3 and again on May 4 across the same regions, but damage was relatively minor.\n\nThe activity became somewhat more severe once again on May 5 across Texas. There were 18 reported tornadoes and many reports of wind and hail damage. One person was injured. A strong storm formed over the [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] area in the late hours of the night of May 5, and early morning hours of May 6. This storm spawned a single tornado with damage rated as an F2 on the [[Fujita Scale]].\n\n====May 9\u201310====\nIn early May 2006, a widespread but mostly minor tornado outbreak took place across portions of the [[United States]]. The event began on the 9th with a few  scattered weak tornadoes touching down in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Alabama]], all of which were rated F0.<ref name=\"Storm Events Database\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?beginDate_mm=05&beginDate_dd=09&beginDate_yyyy=2006&endDate_mm=05&endDate_dd=10&endDate_yyyy=2006&eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&submitbutton=Search&statefips=-999%2CALL |title=Storm Events Database |website=NCDC |publisher=NCDC |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Later that evening, additional tornado activity began to occur in [[Texas]]. An F2 struck the north side of [[Childress, Texas]], resulting in considerable damage. Many trees along the path were snapped and uprooted, roofs of homes were damaged, and sheds were overturned in residential areas. As the tornado struck Childress High School, the gymnasium lost its roof and sustained total collapse of a large brick wall. Three air conditioning units were blown off the roof of the school, and two of them were blown from southeast to northwest, landing 90 to 200 feet from the school. A nearby nursing home was also damaged. At Fair Park, a tennis court was destroyed, several metal light poles were bent and snapped, and a pedestrian bridge that spanned a small lake was ripped from its wooden supports and thrown. An industrial storage building that housed emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with steel beams twisted. One person in town was injured by a falling tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/?n=events-2006-20060509_storms_tor |title=9 MAY 2006 SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS and TORNADO EVENT |website=NWS Lubbock, TX |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Further south, a powerful tornado passed north of [[Westminster, Texas]] and caused major damage in rural areas outside of town.

It was primarily a straight-line wind event, although there were at least five tornadoes reported, some of which produced significant damage.\n\nA greater risk of tornadic activity was issued by the SPC on May 25 for a large swath from the [[Great Lakes]] to the central [[Mississippi Valley]]. The event turned into a derecho with hundreds of severe wind damage reports, but only six tornado reports. There were no tornado-related injuries, but at least one person was injured by straight-line winds.\n\n====May 30\u201331====\n\nA hot and humid air mass entered the northeastern part of the U.S as well as much of southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and severe thunderstorms and tornadoes were sparked by a cold front. Numerous severe weather events were reported across [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] - primarily damaging wind and hail events - when a storm system crossed the area during these two days.\n\nOn May 31 there were at least 6 reports of tornadoes in Indiana and Illinois with no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. Also, [[Lanark County, Ontario|Lanark County]] in eastern [[Ontario]] had two tornado warnings in a span of 18 hours, with the threat of a strong tornado on the evening of May 30. While damage was reported near [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] southwest of [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]] due to straight-line damaging winds, there were no immediate reports of tornadoes despite rotation inside two distinct supercells detected by radar.\n\n===June===\nThere were 139 confirmed tornadoes in the US in June.\n\n====June 5\u20137====\n\nA low pressure system over the northern Plains and a cold front triggered a small tornado outbreak. 17 tornadoes were reported in the [[Dakotas]], eastern [[Iowa]] and southwestern [[Wisconsin]] during these two days (of which at least seven were confirmed), 14 of them occurring on June 6. Two tornadoes were located near [[Barneveld, Wisconsin]], which was the site of an F5 tornado almost the same day in 1984. Both tornadoes were an F0.<ref>[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=060606_tor June 6, 2006 Tornadoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with damage especially confined to trees, although one home was damaged. There were no reported injuries.  There was another tornado in [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk]] and [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia]] counties in Wisconsin, an [[Fujita scale|F1]].\n\nA separate system had reportedly spawned a tornado which inflicted damage to numerous houses near [[Seymour, Indiana]] north of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], but it was confirmed to have been a [[microburst]].\n\n====June 10====\nMore widespread severe weather occurred in the Central Plains with over 100 reports, mostly wind and hail events including reports of [[hurricane force]] wind-gusts. Tornadoes were confined especially in Nebraska where a mobile home and a barn were damaged and trailer was overturned near [[Gordon, Nebraska]]. There was also significant damage to trees and powerlines in [[New Florence, Missouri]] west of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\n====June 11\u201314: Tropical Storm Alberto====\n{{main|Tropical Storm Alberto (2006)}}\nTropical Storm Alberto made landfall on June 13, but was producing squalls well before then. Alberto's bands produced a small tornado event in the [[southeastern United States]]. There were 16 tornadoes reported; four in [[Florida]], three in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], six in [[South Carolina]] and three in [[North Carolina]]. At least seven of the tornadoes were confirmed; one was an F1 and the rest were F0.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/prodsByState.php?state=SC&prodtype=public Public Information - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One person suffered minor injuries in one of the tornadoes.<ref>\"[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060612_rpts.html SPC Storm Reports for 6/12/06].\" ''[[National Weather Service]]/Storm Prediction Center.''

There were at least 17 wind reports exceeding 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) with significant local damage. The heaviest of the activity occurred in [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. Despite the severity of the storms, only four tornadoes were reported in Kansas and three were confirmed; one was an F0 and the other two were F1, all in [[Sherman County, Kansas|Sherman County]].<ref>[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGLD All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====June 18\u201319====\n\nA warm and humid air mass was covering much of the eastern U.S. as well as [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] during this period of severe weather. With the passage of a [[cold front]] and instability, it created a wide area of severe thunderstorms, some as [[supercell]]s and others as [[squall line]]s, which created numerous damage in several U.S. cities as well as important Canadian cities such as [[Ottawa]], [[Sherbrooke]] and [[Granby, Quebec]].\n\nFirst, an unexpected tornado touched down in [[Hartford, Wisconsin]] in the middle of a rain storm with few other storm reports on June 18. Over 50 buildings were reported to have been damaged. Three people were injured by what turned out to be an F1 tornado.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGRB All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Meanwhile, in [[Pembroke, Ontario]] further to the east, what was possibly a tornado but confirmed as a [[microburst]], several roofs including one from a marina and another one from a large warehouse were blown away during the passage of a [[supercell]] storm.\n\nOn June 19, a widespread severe weather event took place throughout the [[Great Lakes]] region and into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. There were no confirmed tornadoes in the US that day, but two were confirmed in [[Ontario]], Canada. One tornado touched down just north of [[Stratford, Ontario]]; it was an F1 and caused moderate damage. A second tornado near [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] occurred late Sunday evening and also rated F1, with a storage shed completely destroyed.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on Ontario - Special Weather Statements - Environment Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230120330/http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on |date=2006-12-30 }}</ref>\n\n====June 21\u201324====\n\nOn the first day of summer, June 21, a significant severe weather outbreak began to develop in much of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and adjacent areas of [[Ontario]]. The most severe weather took place along the [[Interstate 90|I-90]] corridor and around [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, where tornadoes were reported. Another tornado was reported southwest of [[Detroit]] inside a massive cluster of severe thunderstorms that passed through the area in the early evening. However, the tornado did little damage; most of the damage in southeast Michigan was due to straight-line winds.\n\nAnother area of severe weather spawned numerous possible tornadoes in [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Colorado]], with severe weather reports also occurring in [[Iowa]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Missouri]] and [[Nebraska]].\n\nThree people were injured as a result of a landfalling [[waterspout]] in [[Charlotte County, Florida]] in a separate and isolated event. It also damaged numerous homes and destroyed several mobile homes. It was confirmed that there were two tornadoes; one was an F2 and one was an F0.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KTBW All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMore severe weather took place the following day in areas slightly farther south than the previous day's activity. Again, it was primarily a straight-line wind event, with at least 250 wind reports from [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Kentucky]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[West Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] with additional reports from the [[Carolinas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nA small tornado outbreak occurred in two distinct areas: the Southern Plains and the [[Ohio Valley]]. 19 tornadoes were reported - five of them in [[Elbert County, Colorado]] (one was confirmed, destroying a house under construction), likely from the same supercell and five from northwest Ohio in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and [[Van Wert County, Ohio|Van Wert]] counties. Two of the Van Wert County tornadoes were rated F0 (in [[Willshire, Ohio|Willshire]] and [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]]) and another F1 (also in Willshire) while one of the tornadoes in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen County]] was rated F1 with damage limited to sheds and roofs near [[Beaverdam, Ohio|Beaverdam]].<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060622_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060622's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another F0 would hit Willshire the following day. The area has a long history of destructive tornadoes. (See also [[Veterans Day Weekend tornado outbreak of 2002]] and [[Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1965]].)\n\nOne tornado destroyed some barns and heavily damaged two houses in [[Holmes County, Ohio]].

Another tornado was reported in [[Notre-Dame du Laus, Quebec]] north of [[Gatineau]] and [[Ottawa]]. However, the multiple tree and trailer damage was caused by a [[microburst]] embedded inside a powerful [[progressive derecho]].\n\nAt least two deaths and numerous injuries were reported; however they resulted from the wider derecho, not the tornado events embedded within it.\n\n====July 19\u201320====\n\nA similar pattern to the previous event shaped up over parts of the [[Upper Midwest]], although the risk of tornadoes was initially declared even greater. The greatest risk on July 19 was over southern [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]], spreading eastward over [[Michigan]], southern [[Ontario]] and into the north-central [[Appalachians]] on July 20. The risk extends as far south as roughly the [[Interstate 70]] corridor.\n\nA moderate risk of severe weather had been declared by the SPC for July 19. A cluster of storms did develop in the late afternoon and early evening hours in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]] with additional activity in Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. Three tornadoes were reported including a [[derecho]] that formed in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] metro area with heavy damage to trees and power lines, knocking out power to over 500,000 people. The other reports came from Illinois.
