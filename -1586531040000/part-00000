Applications running on an [[end system]] (PC, smartphone etc.) across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. Encryption is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.<ref>{{cite book |author= Mason, Andrew G. |title=Cisco Secure Virtual Private Network |url= https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr |url-access= registration |publisher= Cisco Press |date= 2002 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr/page/7 7]}}</ref>\n\nVPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered [[tunneling protocol]], and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to circumvent [[Geo-blocking|geo-restrictions]] and [[censorship]] or to connect to [[proxy server]]s to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.\n\nA VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:VPN classification-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN classification based on the topology first, then on the technology used.]]\n[[File:Site-to-site VPN-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A typical site-to-site VPN.]]\nEarly data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]]. These networks are not considered true VPNs because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams.<ref>Cisco Systems, et al.

In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access the company's [[intranet]] from outside the office. Site-to-site VPNs allow collaborators in geographically disparate offices to share the same virtual network. A VPN can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar intermediate network, such as two [[IPv6]] networks connected over an [[IPv4]] network.<ref>{{cite web|last=Technet Lab |title=IPv6 traffic over VPN connections |url=http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615203602/http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVPN systems may be classified by:\n* the tunneling protocol used to [[IP tunnel|tunnel]] the traffic\n* the tunnel's termination point location, e.g., on the customer [[Edge device|edge]] or network-provider edge\n* the type of topology of connections, such as site-to-site or network-to-network\n* the levels of security provided\n* the [[OSI model|OSI layer]] they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 circuits or Layer 3 network connectivity\n* the number of simultaneous connections\n\n==Security mechanisms==\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security.

User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods. Network-to-network tunnels often use passwords or [[digital certificates]]. They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.\n\n==Routing==\nTunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered a VPN because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.\n\n===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===\n[[File:Site-to-Site VPN terminology-en.svg|thumb|300px|Site-to-Site VPN terminology.]]\nDepending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or a combination of both.

C devices are not aware of the VPN.\n\n; Customer Edge device (CE)\nA device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.\n\n; Provider edge device (PE)\nA device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.\n\n; Provider device (P)\nA device that operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.\n\n==User-visible PPVPN services==\n===OSI Layer 2 services===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n;Virtual LAN\n[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).\n\n;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)\nDeveloped by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].\n\nAs used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core, a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.<ref>{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}</ref>\n\nIn a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.\n\n;Pseudo wire (PW)\nPW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.\n\n; Ethernet over IP tunneling\nEtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}</ref> is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack<ref>Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011</ref> and the [[SoftEther VPN]]<ref name=\"net-security.org\">net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014</ref> server program.\n\n;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)\nA subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===\nThis section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.\n\nOne of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996</ref> The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.\n\n;BGP/MPLS PPVPN\nIn the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.\n\nPEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.\n\n;Virtual router PPVPN\nThe virtual router architecture,<ref>{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)</ref> as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label but do not need routing distinguishers.\n\n===Unencrypted tunnels===\nSome virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yanyan|date=2006|title=IPsec/VPN security policy correctness and assurance|journal=Journal of High Speed Networks|volume=15|pages=275\u2013289|citeseerx=10.1.1.94.8561}}</ref> For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network but is neither secure nor trusted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks.

For example, a commercial VPN marketed for Internet access (censorship circumvention, anonymization, geo-unblocking) only needs to tunnel the user's internet traffic somewhere else securely and there is typically no way for a user's devices connected to the same \"VPN\" to see each other. These VPNs can be based on typical VPN protocols or more camouflaged VPN implementations like [[SoftEther VPN]], but proxy protocols like [[Shadowsocks]] are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hodge |first1=Rae |title=Proxy vs. VPN: If it's built into your browser, it might not be a true VPN |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/proxy-vs-vpn-if-its-built-into-your-browser-its-actually-not-a-true-vpn/ |website=CNET |accessdate=21 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Commercial VPNs are usually marketed as privacy protection software that offers additional encryption services.\n\nOn the client side, a commercial VPN setup, even those not using a conventional VPN protocol, typically use the operating system's VPN interfaces to capture a user's data to send through.

Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.\n\nA VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:VPN classification-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN classification based on the topology first, then on the technology used.]]\n[[File:Site-to-site VPN-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A typical site-to-site VPN.]]\nEarly data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]].

In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access the company's [[intranet]] from outside the office.

User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods. Network-to-network tunnels often use passwords or [[digital certificates]]. They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.\n\n==Routing==\nTunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered a VPN because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.\n\n===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===\n[[File:Site-to-Site VPN terminology-en.svg|thumb|300px|Site-to-Site VPN terminology.]]\nDepending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or a combination of both.

C devices are not aware of the VPN.\n\n; Customer Edge device (CE)\nA device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.\n\n; Provider edge device (PE)\nA device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.\n\n; Provider device (P)\nA device that operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.\n\n==User-visible PPVPN services==\n===OSI Layer 2 services===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n;Virtual LAN\n[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).\n\n;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)\nDeveloped by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].\n\nAs used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core, a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.<ref>{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}</ref>\n\nIn a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.\n\n;Pseudo wire (PW)\nPW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.\n\n; Ethernet over IP tunneling\nEtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}</ref> is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack<ref>Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011</ref> and the [[SoftEther VPN]]<ref name=\"net-security.org\">net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014</ref> server program.\n\n;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)\nA subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===\nThis section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.\n\nOne of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996</ref> The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.\n\n;BGP/MPLS PPVPN\nIn the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.\n\nPEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.\n\n;Virtual router PPVPN\nThe virtual router architecture,<ref>{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)</ref> as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label but do not need routing distinguishers.\n\n===Unencrypted tunnels===\nSome virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yanyan|date=2006|title=IPsec/VPN security policy correctness and assurance|journal=Journal of High Speed Networks|volume=15|pages=275\u2013289|citeseerx=10.1.1.94.8561}}</ref> For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network but is neither secure nor trusted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks.

For example, a commercial VPN marketed for Internet access (censorship circumvention, anonymization, geo-unblocking) only needs to tunnel the user's internet traffic somewhere else securely and there is typically no way for a user's devices connected to the same \"VPN\" to see each other. These VPNs can be based on typical VPN protocols or more camouflaged VPN implementations like [[SoftEther VPN]], but proxy protocols like [[Shadowsocks]] are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hodge |first1=Rae |title=Proxy vs. VPN: If it's built into your browser, it might not be a true VPN |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/proxy-vs-vpn-if-its-built-into-your-browser-its-actually-not-a-true-vpn/ |website=CNET |accessdate=21 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Commercial VPNs are usually marketed as privacy protection software that offers additional encryption services.\n\nOn the client side, a commercial VPN setup, even those not using a conventional VPN protocol, typically use the operating system's VPN interfaces to capture a user's data to send through.

His formal education was limited to the public schools of the city.  He became a self-taught expert on American tribes by his own studies and his careful observation during long residences with different groups.<ref name=register/>    \n\nIn 1885 he started working with the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] under [[John Wesley Powell]].  He compiled a list of tribes which contained 3,000 names.  It ended after the US Army's 1890 massacre of [[Lakota people|Lakota]] people at [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota]]. Mooney was recognized as a national expert on the American Indian.<ref name=register/> \n\nHe married Ione Lee Gaut on September 28, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and had six children. One son was the writer [[Paul Mooney (writer)|Paul Mooney]]. Mooney died of heart disease in [[Washington, D.C.]] on December 22, 1921.

Although he wrote as a scientist, his clear objectivity towards Native Americans was in sharp contrast to how most other pieces of writing about the Native American population were written during this time. He largely accepted the goal of Indian assimilation as outline by reformers of the generation. However, he still had the restrain to watch what what was being done to these innocent people and remained objective.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe late 1800s was a time where Native Americans were criminally disrespected by the United States of America. The reputation forced upon the Native Americans by the majority of the white press available to Americans spoke unnecessarily ill of the Natives. Mooney was able to speak on the situation objectively, and considering the alternatives being published at the time, made the Native Americans out to be rightfully a lot less dangerous then perceived by the majority of white Americans who read newspapers. \n\nMooney took the time to observe various Native American tribes the way they lived, instead of observing from a far, which prior to Mooney's findings, was the only way people outside reservations knew what was going on in the Native American community. He did not do anything groundbreaking, looking back. But he took the time and effort to treat Native Americans with the respect they deserved and wanted to learn an teach others about their culture. He did so by publishing various books documenting his time with Native American tribes.  \n\n=== ''The Ghost-dance Religion and the Sioux Outbreak of 1890'' ===\nThe book, perhaps Mooney's most famous, is prefaced with a historical survey of comparable millenarian movements among other American Indian groups.

They submitted the soundtrack version because they thought it had the best chance for recognition, but that version had Anna Kendrick and James Corden and basically the whole cast singing it. That worked great for the movie, but that's not the one that was getting radio play \u2014 it was Justin Timberlake's track, and they were not allowed to submit that for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]].

Grammy SVP Bill Freimuth explained to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'':\n\n{{quote|An easy way to understand this would be to call it \"The Justin Timberlake Rule\" or \"The 'Trolls' Rule\". Last year, what I think prompted the proposal was we had a rule that only one version of a song could be submitted in any given year, and in that instance, it was [Timberlake's] 'Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling.' They submitted the soundtrack version because they thought it had the best chance for recognition, but that version had Anna Kendrick and James Corden and basically the whole cast singing it. That worked great for the movie, but that's not the one that was getting radio play \u2014 it was Justin Timberlake's track, and they were not allowed to submit that for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. So after giving more thought to that, it seemed that music for visual media is so specific that it made sense to allow [the change].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/grammy-svp-bill-freimuth-explains-new-rule-changes-1202464990/ |title=Grammy SVP Bill Freimuth Explains New Rule Changes for Songwriters, Hip-Hop and Online Voting |last=Aswad |first=Jem |date=June 14, 2017 |work=Variety |access-date=June 14, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>}}\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\n===North America===\nCounting its first three days of airplay, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" debuted at number 24 on the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] and started at a personal-best number 19 on [[Adult Top 40]], both for the charts dated May 21, 2016.<ref name=\"popdebut\">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7358057/mike-posner-takes-pill-in-ibiza-to-no-1-on-pop-songs-chart | title=Mike Posner Takes 'Pill in Ibiza' to No. 1 on Pop Songs Chart | work=Billboard | date=May 9, 2016 | accessdate=May 9, 2016}}</ref> \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" became the first song in the history of [[Mediabase]] Top 40 to close the entire [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] radio station panel in the first week, being the \"most added\" song in all 186 of them.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/153518/rca-s-timberlake-single-is-first-ever-to-close-ent | title=RCA's Timberlake Single Is First Ever To Close Entire Pop Panel In First Week | publisher=All Access Music Group | date=May 10, 2016 | accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n\"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|26th song to debut at number one]] on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on the chart issue dated May 28, 2016,<ref name=\"hot100numberone\"/> marking Justin Timberlake's fifth chart-topping single in the country.

{"title_page": "Infantry of the British Army", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{British Army Arms}}\n[[File:British Army Infantry Recruiting areas.png|thumb|right|Recruiting areas of British line infantry regiments]]\nThe '''Infantry of the British Army''', part of the [[Structure of the British Army|structure]] of the [[British Army]], comprises 49 [[infantry]] [[battalion]]s, from 19 [[regiment]]s. Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

These two were amalgamated into a single battalion and then amalgamated with [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]] to form a new five battalion regiment, called [[The Rifles]]. On its formation, the Light Division was abolished.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm The Rifles - March 2006 situation report 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515082627/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm |date=15 May 2006 }}</ref>\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role (2 RIFLES, 3 RIFLES) - 2\n*Mechanised Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Commando (1 RIFLES) - 1\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n\n* The single regular battalion of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] is unamalgamated to \"retain an infantry footprint in Northern Ireland\".\n**Air Assault/Light Role (1 R IRISH) - 1\n* The [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] is unaffected by the restructuring.

The Guards Division has The London Regiment as an affiliated TA battalion.\n\n===Strategic Defence and Security Review (2010)/Army 2020===\n{{main|Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Army 2020}}\nFollowing the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], the new government instituted a new defence review. The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel. Four of these battalions, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland; 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment; and 4th Battalion, The Rifles, will be existing battalions, while the fifth will be formed as a new battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review - Army: Written statement - HCWS367|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/sdsr-2015-and-the-army/oral/34418.html|title=Oral evidence: SDSR 2015 and the Army, HC 108|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/81826/uk-to-recruit-more-gurkha-soldiers |title=UK to recruit more Gurkha soldiers |last=Ripley |first=Tim |date=18 July 2018|website=Jane's 360 |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====Guards Division====\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (1 SG) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG) - 2\n*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 WG) - 2\n*Public Duties (2 GREN GDS, 2 COLDM GDS, 2 SG){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve (LONDONS) - 1\n<small>All five battalions will periodically rotate roles</small>\n\n====Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 R WELSH) - 1\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (4 SCOTS) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 SCOTS, 1 R IRISH) - 2\n*Light Role Infantry (2 SCOTS) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (1 SCOTS) - 1\n*Public Duties - (5 SCOTS){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve - (6 SCOTS, 7 SCOTS, 3 R WELSH, 2 R IRISH) - 4\n\n====King's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 YORKS, 1 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 YORKS) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 LANCS, 2 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 LANCS) - 1\n*Army Reserve (4 LANCS, 4 YORKS, 4 MERCIAN) - 3\n\n====Queen's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 PWRR, 1 RRF) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (Home Defence) (1 RG) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 PWRR) - 1\n*Army Reserve (3 PWRR, 4 PWRR, 5 RRF, 3 R ANGLIAN) - 4\n\n====The Rifles====\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RIFLES, 2 RIFLES) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Army Reserve (6 RIFLES, 7 RIFLES, 8 RIFLES) - 3\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RGR, 2 RGR) - 2\n*Parachute Infantry (2 PARA, 3 PARA, 4 PARA) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (3 RGR) - 1\n<small>:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} These are the battalions represented by the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|four incremental companies]]</small>\n\n==Other regiments==\n\n===Disbanded regiments===\nOver time, a handful of infantry regiments have disappeared from the roll through disbandment rather than amalgamation.

For example, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], after losing his seat in the [[1925 Canadian federal election|1925 federal election]] (that his party won), briefly \"governed from the hallway\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later.

That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]] from the commons in such a scenario.\n\nPrime ministers who are not MPs upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the House of Commons as soon as possible. For example, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], after losing his seat in the [[1925 Canadian federal election|1925 federal election]] (that his party won), briefly \"governed from the hallway\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, [[John Turner]] replaced [[Pierre Trudeau]] as leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power.

The building dates from 1630 but has been substantially altered, later that century, and in 1750 and 1800.  Former names for it are '''Morehouse''' and '''Compton Hall'''. It was home to philosophical writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]] at the end of the seventeenth century; and served as a hydrotherapy retreat in the nineteenth century when it was visited by [[George Combe]], who died here, the leading phrenologist of the day, and by naturalist [[Charles Darwin]].\n\n==Approaches to Moor Park==\n[[File:Moor Park Lane, Farnham.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Moor Park Lane]]\nThe [[North Downs Way]] runs along the pavement north of the site and runs east through woods of [[Runfold]].\n\nAccess is possible by road, but walking provides many further areas to view. A major spur of the [[Greensand Way|long-distance footpath, the Greensand Way]] commences in the grounds, passes the front of the house, leading to Moor Park Nature Reserve, [[Mother Ludlam's Cave]] and has a bridge to [[Waverley Abbey]] all at the far end of the grounds.  \n\nMoor Park Lane, a northern [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]] and former carriage drive, links the house to the A31 road at the Shepherd and Flock pub, Farnham with parking. To one side of this in [[water meadows]] with several channels is High Mill, which is Grade II listed and the partially hidden (and dry) remains of an [[artificial waterfall]] which featured on picture [[postcard]]s in Victorian times.<ref>High Mill, Compton/Farnham - Grade II - {{NHLE|num=1116616|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Medieval period==\nA house has stood on the site, next to the [[River Wey]] at the hamlet of [[Compton, Waverley|Compton]] since at least the [[Tudor period]] when it had {{convert|434|acres}}, 200 of which were detached in Farnham.

Five to six years later, Richard Cresswell then Anthony Bagge received it.  Later, owner Robert Ashton leased it to his nephew, John Cotton.  It formed part of the 1632 death estate of Sir Richard Clarke.<ref name=m/>\n\n==Sir William Temple, patron of Swift==\n{{main|Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet}}\nAbout 1686 the house was bought by Sir William Temple from the Clarke estates and it was he who renamed it Moor Park after the [[Moor Park (house)|Hertfordshire mansion of that name]].

Swift acted as her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname \"Stella\", and the two maintained a close relationship for the rest of Esther's life: some believed that they secretly married in 1716.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Barnett | first=Louise | authorlink=Louise Barnett | title=Jonathan Swift in the Company of Women | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2006 | isbn=9780195188660 | page=40 }}</ref>  Swift met many of Temple's distinguished guests during his time here: [[William III of England|King William III]], [[John Dryden]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]] and others.\n\n==1770-1900==\nTemple died in 1699. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, but his heart, by his special wish, was placed in a silver casket under the sun-dial at Moor Park, near his favourite window seat. He left Moor Park to his granddaughter Elizabeth, who married her husband John Temple and died in 1770, leaving it to her nephew Basil Bacon, son of Nicholas Bacon of [[Shrubland Hall]].<ref name=m/>  His estranged son Charles Williams resumed the name of Bacon on inheriting (due to lack of siblings' heirs) and the house became a [[hydrotherapy]] centre under La Trobe Bateman who bought it in 1858.<ref name=m/> Here, [[Charles Darwin]] received [[hydropathic]] treatment in 1859 for [[Charles Darwin's illness|his illness]] from {{abbreviation|Dr|doctor}} Edward Wickstead Lane. He wrote that he played [[billiards]] here and said \"I really think I shall make a point of coming here for a fortnight occasionally, as the country is very pleasant for walking\". He wrote that \"it is really quite astonishing & utterly unaccountable the good this one week has done me\", but later became more unwell and told his son that he was unable to climb more than halfway up the nearby 100m proud [[Tilford#Geography|Crooksbury Hill]].\n\n==The Battle of Moor Park==\n[[File:Moor Park House.jpg|thumb|Gate house with clock, by the site of the Battle of Moor Park]]\nOne of Temple's descendants, [[Sir William Rose, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Rose]],<ref>Sir William Rose, Bt. (1846-1902) was a son of Sir William Rose, 1st Bt. and his wife, Charlotte Temple, daughter of Robert Emmett Temple.</ref> informed Farnham Urban District Council in 1897 that he intended to close the lodge gates of Moor Park and \"not allow any person to enter without written authority\". The council informed Rose's solicitor that \"they had no doubt as to the rights of way over Moor Park and were resolved at whatever cost to use all proper means to preserve such rights\". Matters escalated quickly. Rose determined that he would go ahead with the closure and the council prepared to reopen the gates, by force if necessary. Rose employed former [[Metropolitan Police]]men and others to secure the gates by force. The events of Sunday, 17 January 1897 were not in keeping with the traditional view of a Victorian gentleman's estate on the Sabbath - Rose's men closed the gates and secured them with chains. A crowd of some four to five hundred local men (and a few women) gathered outside, armed with sticks, [[crowbar (tool)|crowbars]], [[sledgehammer]]s and other tools or weapons. The council's men were cheered by the crowd as they forced open the gates using crowbars. The defenders (private forces) were no match for the crowd (who were supporting the removal of an unlawful obstruction).  The event was dubbed the '''Moor Park Riot''' or the '''Battle of Moor Park'''.\n\n==Moor Park in the 20th century==\nThe estate was purchased in the late 19th century by (William) Aldwin Soames (1850-1916), a Russian merchant whose father had founded [[Brighton College]] in 1845, and his family occupied the house until about 1937, when its [[freehold (law)|freehold]] was sold by a Temple-Rose descendant to become a [[country club]], \"Swift's Club\". During [[World War II]] the house was requisitioned by the [[British Army|army]] who used it as a [[billet]] for [[Canadian Army|Canadian troops]]. Moor Park became seriously dilapidated during this period and, in 1948, was bought by a developer for demolition. In the summer of that year [[Harry Brittain|Sir Harry Brittain]] wrote to ''The Times'', appealing for it to be saved. A [[Canon (priest)|Canon]], R. E. Parsons, responded by using the house to set up a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Adult Education]] centre, '''Moor Park College'''. At the end of 1949 Canon Parsons, his wife Hester, and their family came to live in the adjoining cottage. They devoted their energies, supported by financial gifts, volunteer help, and grants from [[Surrey County Council]], to the venture of restoring the house and setting up the college. In 1953 funds were exhausted and an emergency meeting was called but the Hesters, supported by a group, the '''Friends of Moor Park''', survived the crisis and, the following year, a milestone was reached when an [[educational]] [[Charitable trust|trust]] was established to run the college.\n\nThe top floor was used by \"'''Oversea Service'''\" as their headquarters and college from 1955 to 1959.

He was buried in Westminster Abbey, but his heart, by his special wish, was placed in a silver casket under the sun-dial at Moor Park, near his favourite window seat. He left Moor Park to his granddaughter Elizabeth, who married her husband John Temple and died in 1770, leaving it to her nephew Basil Bacon, son of Nicholas Bacon of [[Shrubland Hall]].<ref name=m/>  His estranged son Charles Williams resumed the name of Bacon on inheriting (due to lack of siblings' heirs) and the house became a [[hydrotherapy]] centre under La Trobe Bateman who bought it in 1858.<ref name=m/> Here, [[Charles Darwin]] received [[hydropathic]] treatment in 1859 for [[Charles Darwin's illness|his illness]] from {{abbreviation|Dr|doctor}} Edward Wickstead Lane.

He wrote that \"it is really quite astonishing & utterly unaccountable the good this one week has done me\", but later became more unwell and told his son that he was unable to climb more than halfway up the nearby 100m proud [[Tilford#Geography|Crooksbury Hill]].\n\n==The Battle of Moor Park==\n[[File:Moor Park House.jpg|thumb|Gate house with clock, by the site of the Battle of Moor Park]]\nOne of Temple's descendants, [[Sir William Rose, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Rose]],<ref>Sir William Rose, Bt. (1846-1902) was a son of Sir William Rose, 1st Bt. and his wife, Charlotte Temple, daughter of Robert Emmett Temple.</ref> informed Farnham Urban District Council in 1897 that he intended to close the lodge gates of Moor Park and \"not allow any person to enter without written authority\". The council informed Rose's solicitor that \"they had no doubt as to the rights of way over Moor Park and were resolved at whatever cost to use all proper means to preserve such rights\". Matters escalated quickly. Rose determined that he would go ahead with the closure and the council prepared to reopen the gates, by force if necessary. Rose employed former [[Metropolitan Police]]men and others to secure the gates by force. The events of Sunday, 17 January 1897 were not in keeping with the traditional view of a Victorian gentleman's estate on the Sabbath - Rose's men closed the gates and secured them with chains. A crowd of some four to five hundred local men (and a few women) gathered outside, armed with sticks, [[crowbar (tool)|crowbars]], [[sledgehammer]]s and other tools or weapons. The council's men were cheered by the crowd as they forced open the gates using crowbars. The defenders (private forces) were no match for the crowd (who were supporting the removal of an unlawful obstruction).  The event was dubbed the '''Moor Park Riot''' or the '''Battle of Moor Park'''.\n\n==Moor Park in the 20th century==\nThe estate was purchased in the late 19th century by (William) Aldwin Soames (1850-1916), a Russian merchant whose father had founded [[Brighton College]] in 1845, and his family occupied the house until about 1937, when its [[freehold (law)|freehold]] was sold by a Temple-Rose descendant to become a [[country club]], \"Swift's Club\". During [[World War II]] the house was requisitioned by the [[British Army|army]] who used it as a [[billet]] for [[Canadian Army|Canadian troops]]. Moor Park became seriously dilapidated during this period and, in 1948, was bought by a developer for demolition. In the summer of that year [[Harry Brittain|Sir Harry Brittain]] wrote to ''The Times'', appealing for it to be saved. A [[Canon (priest)|Canon]], R. E. Parsons, responded by using the house to set up a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Adult Education]] centre, '''Moor Park College'''. At the end of 1949 Canon Parsons, his wife Hester, and their family came to live in the adjoining cottage. They devoted their energies, supported by financial gifts, volunteer help, and grants from [[Surrey County Council]], to the venture of restoring the house and setting up the college. In 1953 funds were exhausted and an emergency meeting was called but the Hesters, supported by a group, the '''Friends of Moor Park''', survived the crisis and, the following year, a milestone was reached when an [[educational]] [[Charitable trust|trust]] was established to run the college.\n\nThe top floor was used by \"'''Oversea Service'''\" as their headquarters and college from 1955 to 1959.

Central to this are the concepts of the thermodynamic ''[[System (thermodynamics)|system]]'' and its ''[[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]]''. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, and those properties are in turn related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potential]]s, which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.\n\nWith these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to changes in their environment. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics in [[science]] and [[engineering]], such as [[engine]]s, [[phase transition]]s, [[chemical reaction]]s, [[transport phenomena]], and even [[black hole]]s.

The schools with the most-lasting effect in founding the modern versions of thermodynamics are the Berlin school, particularly as established in [[Rudolf Clausius]]\u2019s 1865 textbook ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat'', the Vienna school, with the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and the Gibbsian school at Yale University, American engineer [[Willard Gibbs]]' 1876 ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'' launching [[chemical thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.eoht.info/page/Schools+of+thermodynamics Schools of thermodynamics] \u2013 EoHT.info.</ref>]]\n\n==History==\nThe [[history of thermodynamics]] as a scientific discipline generally begins with [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and demonstrated a [[vacuum]] using his [[Magdeburg hemispheres]].  Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the English physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump.<ref>{{cite book | author=Partington, J.R. | title=A Short History of Chemistry | url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofch0000part_q6h4 | url-access=registration | publisher=Dover | year=1989 | isbn= | oclc=19353301| author-link=J. R. Partington }}</ref> Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].  In time, [[Boyle's Law]] was formulated, which states that pressure and volume are [[inverse proportion|inversely proportional]].  Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built a [[steam digester]], which was a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a [[piston]] and a cylinder engine.  He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine, followed by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time.\n\nThe fundamental concepts of [[heat capacity]] and [[latent heat]], which were necessary for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor [[Joseph Black]] at the University of Glasgow, where [[James Watt]] was employed as an instrument maker.  Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who conceived the idea of the [[Watt steam engine#Separate condenser|external condenser]] which resulted in a large increase in [[steam engine]] efficiency.<ref>The Newcomen engine was improved from 1711 until Watt's work, making the efficiency comparison subject to qualification, but the increase from the 1865 version was on the order of 100%.</ref>  Drawing on all the previous work led [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], the \"father of thermodynamics\", to publish ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency.  The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the [[Carnot engine]], the [[Carnot cycle]], and '''motive power'''.

It is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. The qualifier ''classical'' reflects the fact that it represents the first level of understanding of the subject as it developed in the 19th century and describes the changes of a system in terms of macroscopic empirical (large scale, and measurable) parameters. A microscopic interpretation of these concepts was later provided by the development of ''statistical mechanics''.\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\n[[Statistical mechanics]], also called statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states.  This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] at the microscopic level.<ref name= \"NKS note b\" />\n\n===Chemical thermodynamics===\n[[Chemical thermodynamics]] is the study of the interrelation of [[energy]] with [[chemical reactions]] or with a physical change of [[thermodynamic state|state]] within the confines of the [[laws of thermodynamics]].\n\n===Equilibrium thermodynamics===\n[[Equilibrium thermodynamics]] is the study of transfers of matter and energy in systems or bodies that, by agencies in their surroundings, can be driven from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another. The term 'thermodynamic equilibrium' indicates a state of balance, in which all macroscopic flows are zero; in the case of the simplest systems or bodies, their intensive properties are homogeneous, and their pressures are perpendicular to their boundaries. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, between macroscopically distinct parts of the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or surroundings.\n\n[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.\n\n==Laws of thermodynamics==\n{{Main|Laws of thermodynamics}}\nThermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each. In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following.\n\n===Zeroth Law===\nThe [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] states: ''If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.''\n\nThis statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of [[thermodynamic system]]s under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. [[Brownian motion]]) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide whether two bodies are at the same [[temperature]], it is not necessary to bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time.<ref>Moran, Michael J. and Howard N. Shapiro, 2008. ''Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics''. 6th ed. Wiley and Sons: 16.</ref> The law provides an empirical definition of temperature, and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.\n\nThe zeroth law was not initially recognized as a separate law of thermodynamics, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws.  The first, second, and third laws had been explicitly stated already, and found common acceptance in the physics community before the importance of the zeroth law for the definition of temperature was realized. As it was impractical to renumber the other laws, it was named the ''zeroth law''.\n\n===First Law===\nThe [[first law of thermodynamics]] states: ''In a process without transfer of matter, the change in [[internal energy]],'' {{math|\u0394''U''}}'', of a [[thermodynamic system]] is equal to the energy gained as heat,'' {{math|''Q''}}'', less the thermodynamic work,'' {{math|''W''}}'', done by the system on its surroundings.''<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, AIP Press, Woodbury NY, {{ISBN|0883187973}}, p. 79.</ref><ref group=nb>The sign convention (Q is heat supplied ''to'' the system as, W is work done ''by'' the system) is that of [[Rudolf Clausius]]. The opposite sign convention is customary in chemical thermodynamics.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\Delta U = Q - W</math>.\n\nFor  processes that include transfer of matter, a further statement is needed: ''With due account of the respective fiducial reference states of the systems, when two systems, which may be of different chemical compositions, initially separated only by an impermeable wall, and otherwise isolated, are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall, then''\n\n:<math>U_0 = U_1 + U_2</math>,\n\n''where'' {{math|''U''<sub>0</sub>}} ''denotes the internal energy  of the combined system, and''  {{math|''U''<sub>1</sub>}} ''and'' {{math|''U''<sub>2</sub>}} ''denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems.''\n\nAdapted for thermodynamics, this law is an expression of the principle of [[conservation of energy]], which states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985).''Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics'', second edition, John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken NY, {{ISBN|9780471862567}}, pp. 11\u201313.</ref>\n\nInternal energy is a principal property of the [[thermodynamic state]], while heat and work are modes of energy transfer by which a process may change this state. A change of internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat added or removed and work performed on or by the system. As a [[State function|function of state]], the internal energy does not depend on the manner, or on the path through intermediate steps, by which the system arrived at its state.\n\n===Second Law===\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states: ''Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location.''<ref name= \"NKS note b\" />\n\nThis law is an expression of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. [[Entropy]] is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems that are far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is the [[entropy production|maximum entropy production]] principle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=Lars|title=Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes|journal=Phys.

There are many versions of the second law, but they all have the same effect, which is to explain the phenomenon of [[irreversibility]] in nature.\n\n===Third Law===\nThe [[third law of thermodynamics]] states: ''As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.''\n\nThis law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching [[absolute zero]] of temperature.  This law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternate definitions include \"the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system is smallest at absolute zero,\" or equivalently \"it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes\".\n\nAbsolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to achieve, is \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C (degrees Celsius), or \u2212459.67&nbsp;\u00b0F (degrees Fahrenheit), or 0 K (kelvin), or 0\u00b0 R (degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]]).\n\n==System models==\n[[File:system boundary.svg|200px|thumb|right|A diagram of a generic thermodynamic system]]\nAn important concept in thermodynamics is the [[thermodynamic system]], which is a precisely defined region of the universe under study. Everything in the universe except the system is called the [[Environment (systems)|''surroundings'']]. A system is separated from the remainder of the universe by a [[Boundary (thermodynamic)|''boundary'']] which may be a physical boundary or notional, but which by convention defines a finite volume. Exchanges of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat]], or [[matter]] between the system and the surroundings take place across this boundary.\n\nIn practice, the boundary of a system is simply an imaginary dotted line drawn around a volume within which is going to be a change in the [[internal energy]] of that volume.  Anything that passes across the boundary that effects a change in the internal energy of the system needs to be accounted for in the energy balance equation.  The volume can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as [[Max Planck]] defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a [[steam engine]], such as [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] defined in 1824; it can be the body of a [[tropical cyclone]], such as [[Kerry Emanuel]] theorized in 1986 in the field of [[atmospheric thermodynamics]]; it could also be just one [[nuclide]] (i.e. a system of [[quark]]s) as hypothesized in [[quantum thermodynamics]], or the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole thermodynamics|black hole]].\n\nBoundaries are of four types: fixed, movable, real, and imaginary. For example, in an engine, a fixed boundary means the piston is locked at its position, within which a constant volume process might occur. If the piston is allowed to move that boundary is movable while the cylinder and cylinder head boundaries are fixed.  For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open systems boundaries are often imaginary. In the case of a jet engine, a fixed imaginary boundary might be assumed at the intake of the engine, fixed boundaries along the surface of the case and a second fixed imaginary boundary across the exhaust nozzle.\n\nGenerally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries:\n{{table of thermodynamic systems}}\nAs time passes in an isolated system, internal differences of pressures, densities, and temperatures tend to even out. A system in which all equalizing processes have gone to completion is said to be in a [[state (thermodynamic)|state]] of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\nOnce in thermodynamic equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium are much simpler and easier to understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a dynamic thermodynamic process, the simplifying assumption is made that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing thermodynamic processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state and are said to be [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]].\n\n==States and processes==\nWhen a system is at equilibrium under a given set of conditions, it is said to be in a definite [[thermodynamic state]]. The state of the system can be described by a number of [[state function|state quantities]] that do not depend on the process by which the system arrived at its state. They are called [[intensive variable]]s or [[extensive variable]]s according to how they change when the size of the system changes.  The properties of the system can be described by an [[equation of state]] which specifies the relationship between these variables.  State may be thought of as the instantaneous quantitative description of a system with a set number of variables held constant.\n\nA [[thermodynamic process]] may be defined as the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state. It can be described by [[process function|process quantities]]. Typically, each thermodynamic process is distinguished from other processes in energetic character according to what parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., are held fixed;  Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] pair.\n\nSeveral commonly studied thermodynamic processes are:\n* [[Adiabatic process]]: occurs without loss or gain of energy by [[heat]]\n* [[Isenthalpic process]]: occurs at a constant [[enthalpy]]\n* [[Isentropic process]]: a reversible adiabatic process, occurs at a constant [[entropy]]\n* [[Isobaric process]]: occurs at constant [[pressure]]\n* [[Isochoric process]]: occurs at constant [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (also called isometric/isovolumetric)\n* [[Isothermal process]]: occurs at a constant [[temperature]]\n* [[steady state|Steady state process]]: occurs without a change in the [[internal energy]]\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThere are two types of [[thermodynamic instruments]], the '''meter''' and the '''reservoir'''. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a [[thermodynamic system]]. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics|zeroth law]] states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] in 1872, asserts that it is possible to measure temperature. An idealized [[thermometer]] is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the [[ideal gas law]] ''pV=nRT'', the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a [[barometer]] may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A [[calorimeter]] is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system.\n\nA thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that its state parameters are not appreciably altered when it is brought into contact with the system of interest. When the reservoir is brought into contact with the system, the system is brought into equilibrium with the reservoir. For example, a pressure reservoir is a system at a particular pressure, which imposes that pressure upon the system to which it is mechanically connected. The Earth's atmosphere is often used as a pressure reservoir. If ocean water is used to cool a power plant, the ocean is often  a temperature reservoir in the analysis of the power plant cycle.\n\n== Conjugate variables ==\n{{Main|Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|l1=Conjugate variables}}\n\nThe central concept of thermodynamics is that of [[energy]], the ability to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. By the [[first law of thermodynamics|First Law]], the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In [[mechanics]], for example, energy transfer equals the product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.\n\n[[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|Conjugate variables]] are pairs of thermodynamic concepts, with the first being akin to a \"force\" applied to some [[thermodynamic system]], the second being akin to the resulting \"displacement,\" and the product of the two equalling the amount of energy transferred. The common conjugate variables are:\n* [[Pressure]]-[[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (the [[Mechanics|mechanical]] parameters);\n* [[Temperature]]-[[entropy]] (thermal parameters);\n* [[Chemical potential]]-[[particle number]] (material parameters).\n\n== Potentials ==\n[[Thermodynamic potential]]s are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure the energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state.  The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure.  For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively.\n\nThe five most well known potentials are:\n{{table of thermodynamic potentials}}\n\nwhere <math>T</math> is the [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]], <math>S</math> the [[entropy]], <math>p</math> the [[pressure]], <math>V</math> the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], <math>\\mu</math> the [[chemical potential]], <math>N</math> the number of particles in the system, and <math>i</math> is the count of particles types in the system.\n\nThermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through [[Legendre transformation]].\n\n== Applied fields ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n* [[Biological thermodynamics]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics]]\n* [[Chemical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Classical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|Equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* [[Industrial ecology]] (re: [[Exergy]])\n* [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* [[Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]]\n* [[Psychrometrics]]\n* [[Quantum thermodynamics]]\n* [[Statistical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Thermoeconomics]]\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Physics}}\n* [[Thermodynamic process path]]\n\n===Lists and timelines===\n* [[List of important publications in physics#Thermodynamics|List of important publications in thermodynamics]]\n* [[List of textbooks in statistical mechanics|List of textbooks on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics]]\n* [[List of thermal conductivities]]\n* [[List of thermodynamic properties]]\n* [[Table of thermodynamic equations]]\n* [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author1=Goldstein, Martin|author2=Inge F.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Refrigerator and the Universe|url=https://archive.org/details/refrigeratoruniv0000gold|url-access=registration|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-674-75325-9|location=|pages=|oclc=32826343}} A nontechnical introduction, good on historical and interpretive matters.\n* {{cite journal |last1=Kazakov |first1=Andrei |last2=Muzny |first2=Chris D. |last3=Chirico |first3=Robert D. |last4=Diky |first4=Vladimir V. |last5=Frenkel |first5=Michael |title=Web Thermo Tables \u2013 an On-Line Version of the TRC Thermodynamic Tables |journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology |volume=113 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=209\u2013220 |issn=1044-677X |doi=10.6028/jres.113.016 |pmc=4651616 |pmid=27096122}}\n* {{cite book|author=Gibbs J.W.|title=The Collected Works of J.

Central to this are the concepts of the thermodynamic ''[[System (thermodynamics)|system]]'' and its ''[[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]]''. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, and those properties are in turn related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potential]]s, which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.\n\nWith these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to changes in their environment. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics in [[science]] and [[engineering]], such as [[engine]]s, [[phase transition]]s, [[chemical reaction]]s, [[transport phenomena]], and even [[black hole]]s. The results of thermodynamics are essential for other fields of [[physics]] and for [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[cell biology]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[materials science]], and [[economics]], to name a few.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Smith | first1=J.M. | last2=Van Ness | first2=H.C. | last3=Abbott | first3=M.M. | title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics | journal=Journal of Chemical Education | volume=27 | issue=10 | page=584 | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-07-310445-4 | oclc=56491111| bibcode=1950JChEd..27..584S | doi=10.1021/ed027p584.3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Haynie, Donald, T. | title=Biological Thermodynamics | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-521-79549-4 | oclc=43993556}}</ref>\n\nThis article is focused mainly on classical thermodynamics which primarily studies systems in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].

The schools with the most-lasting effect in founding the modern versions of thermodynamics are the Berlin school, particularly as established in [[Rudolf Clausius]]\u2019s 1865 textbook ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat'', the Vienna school, with the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and the Gibbsian school at Yale University, American engineer [[Willard Gibbs]]' 1876 ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'' launching [[chemical thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.eoht.info/page/Schools+of+thermodynamics Schools of thermodynamics] \u2013 EoHT.info.</ref>]]\n\n==History==\nThe [[history of thermodynamics]] as a scientific discipline generally begins with [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and demonstrated a [[vacuum]] using his [[Magdeburg hemispheres]].  Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the English physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump.<ref>{{cite book | author=Partington, J.R. | title=A Short History of Chemistry | url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofch0000part_q6h4 | url-access=registration | publisher=Dover | year=1989 | isbn= | oclc=19353301| author-link=J. R. Partington }}</ref> Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].  In time, [[Boyle's Law]] was formulated, which states that pressure and volume are [[inverse proportion|inversely proportional]].  Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built a [[steam digester]], which was a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a [[piston]] and a cylinder engine.  He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine, followed by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time.\n\nThe fundamental concepts of [[heat capacity]] and [[latent heat]], which were necessary for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor [[Joseph Black]] at the University of Glasgow, where [[James Watt]] was employed as an instrument maker.  Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who conceived the idea of the [[Watt steam engine#Separate condenser|external condenser]] which resulted in a large increase in [[steam engine]] efficiency.<ref>The Newcomen engine was improved from 1711 until Watt's work, making the efficiency comparison subject to qualification, but the increase from the 1865 version was on the order of 100%.</ref>  Drawing on all the previous work led [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], the \"father of thermodynamics\", to publish ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency.  The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the [[Carnot engine]], the [[Carnot cycle]], and '''motive power'''.

It is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. The qualifier ''classical'' reflects the fact that it represents the first level of understanding of the subject as it developed in the 19th century and describes the changes of a system in terms of macroscopic empirical (large scale, and measurable) parameters. A microscopic interpretation of these concepts was later provided by the development of ''statistical mechanics''.\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\n[[Statistical mechanics]], also called statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states.  This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] at the microscopic level..<ref name= \"NKS note b\" />\n\n===Chemical thermodynamics===\n[[Chemical thermodynamics]] is the study of the interrelation of [[energy]] with [[chemical reactions]] or with a physical change of [[thermodynamic state|state]] within the confines of the [[laws of thermodynamics]].\n\n===Equilibrium thermodynamics===\n[[Equilibrium thermodynamics]] is the study of transfers of matter and energy in systems or bodies that, by agencies in their surroundings, can be driven from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another. The term 'thermodynamic equilibrium' indicates a state of balance, in which all macroscopic flows are zero; in the case of the simplest systems or bodies, their intensive properties are homogeneous, and their pressures are perpendicular to their boundaries. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, between macroscopically distinct parts of the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or surroundings.\n\n[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.\n\n==Laws of thermodynamics==\n{{Main|Laws of thermodynamics}}\nThermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each. In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following.\n\n===Zeroth Law===\nThe [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] states: ''If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.''\n\nThis statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of [[thermodynamic system]]s under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. [[Brownian motion]]) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide whether two bodies are at the same [[temperature]], it is not necessary to bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time.<ref>Moran, Michael J. and Howard N. Shapiro, 2008. ''Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics''. 6th ed. Wiley and Sons: 16.</ref> The law provides an empirical definition of temperature, and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.\n\nThe zeroth law was not initially recognized as a separate law of thermodynamics, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws.  The first, second, and third laws had been explicitly stated already, and found common acceptance in the physics community before the importance of the zeroth law for the definition of temperature was realized. As it was impractical to renumber the other laws, it was named the ''zeroth law''.\n\n===First Law===\nThe [[first law of thermodynamics]] states: ''In a process without transfer of matter, the change in [[internal energy]],'' {{math|\u0394''U''}}'', of a [[thermodynamic system]] is equal to the energy gained as heat,'' {{math|''Q''}}'', less the thermodynamic work,'' {{math|''W''}}'', done by the system on its surroundings.''<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, AIP Press, Woodbury NY, {{ISBN|0883187973}}, p. 79.</ref><ref group=nb>The sign convention (Q is heat supplied ''to'' the system as, W is work done ''by'' the system) is that of [[Rudolf Clausius]]. The opposite sign convention is customary in chemical thermodynamics.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\Delta U = Q - W</math>.\n\nFor  processes that include transfer of matter, a further statement is needed: ''With due account of the respective fiducial reference states of the systems, when two systems, which may be of different chemical compositions, initially separated only by an impermeable wall, and otherwise isolated, are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall, then''\n\n:<math>U_0 = U_1 + U_2</math>,\n\n''where'' {{math|''U''<sub>0</sub>}} ''denotes the internal energy  of the combined system, and''  {{math|''U''<sub>1</sub>}} ''and'' {{math|''U''<sub>2</sub>}} ''denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems.''\n\nAdapted for thermodynamics, this law is an expression of the principle of [[conservation of energy]], which states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985).''Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics'', second edition, John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken NY, {{ISBN|9780471862567}}, pp. 11\u201313.</ref>\n\nInternal energy is a principal property of the [[thermodynamic state]], while heat and work are modes of energy transfer by which a process may change this state. A change of internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat added or removed and work performed on or by the system. As a [[State function|function of state]], the internal energy does not depend on the manner, or on the path through intermediate steps, by which the system arrived at its state.\n\n===Second Law===\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states: ''Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location.''<ref name= \"NKS note b\" />\n\nThis law is an expression of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. [[Entropy]] is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems that are far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is the [[entropy production|maximum entropy production]] principle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=Lars|title=Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes|journal=Phys.

There are many versions of the second law, but they all have the same effect, which is to explain the phenomenon of [[irreversibility]] in nature.\n\n===Third Law===\nThe [[third law of thermodynamics]] states: ''As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.''\n\nThis law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching [[absolute zero]] of temperature.  This law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternate definitions include \"the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system is smallest at absolute zero,\" or equivalently \"it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes\".\n\nAbsolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to achieve, is \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C (degrees Celsius), or \u2212459.67&nbsp;\u00b0F (degrees Fahrenheit), or 0 K (kelvin), or 0\u00b0 R (degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]]).\n\n==System models==\n[[File:system boundary.svg|200px|thumb|right|A diagram of a generic thermodynamic system]]\nAn important concept in thermodynamics is the [[thermodynamic system]], which is a precisely defined region of the universe under study. Everything in the universe except the system is called the [[Environment (systems)|''surroundings'']]. A system is separated from the remainder of the universe by a [[Boundary (thermodynamic)|''boundary'']] which may be a physical boundary or notional, but which by convention defines a finite volume. Exchanges of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat]], or [[matter]] between the system and the surroundings take place across this boundary.\n\nIn practice, the boundary of a system is simply an imaginary dotted line drawn around a volume within which is going to be a change in the [[internal energy]] of that volume.  Anything that passes across the boundary that effects a change in the internal energy of the system needs to be accounted for in the energy balance equation.  The volume can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as [[Max Planck]] defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a [[steam engine]], such as [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] defined in 1824; it can be the body of a [[tropical cyclone]], such as [[Kerry Emanuel]] theorized in 1986 in the field of [[atmospheric thermodynamics]]; it could also be just one [[nuclide]] (i.e. a system of [[quark]]s) as hypothesized in [[quantum thermodynamics]], or the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole thermodynamics|black hole]].\n\nBoundaries are of four types: fixed, movable, real, and imaginary. For example, in an engine, a fixed boundary means the piston is locked at its position, within which a constant volume process might occur. If the piston is allowed to move that boundary is movable while the cylinder and cylinder head boundaries are fixed.  For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open systems boundaries are often imaginary. In the case of a jet engine, a fixed imaginary boundary might be assumed at the intake of the engine, fixed boundaries along the surface of the case and a second fixed imaginary boundary across the exhaust nozzle.\n\nGenerally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries:\n{{table of thermodynamic systems}}\nAs time passes in an isolated system, internal differences of pressures, densities, and temperatures tend to even out. A system in which all equalizing processes have gone to completion is said to be in a [[state (thermodynamic)|state]] of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\nOnce in thermodynamic equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium are much simpler and easier to understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a dynamic thermodynamic process, the simplifying assumption is made that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing thermodynamic processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state and are said to be [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]].\n\n==States and processes==\nWhen a system is at equilibrium under a given set of conditions, it is said to be in a definite [[thermodynamic state]]. The state of the system can be described by a number of [[state function|state quantities]] that do not depend on the process by which the system arrived at its state. They are called [[intensive variable]]s or [[extensive variable]]s according to how they change when the size of the system changes.  The properties of the system can be described by an [[equation of state]] which specifies the relationship between these variables.  State may be thought of as the instantaneous quantitative description of a system with a set number of variables held constant.\n\nA [[thermodynamic process]] may be defined as the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state. It can be described by [[process function|process quantities]]. Typically, each thermodynamic process is distinguished from other processes in energetic character according to what parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., are held fixed;  Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] pair.\n\nSeveral commonly studied thermodynamic processes are:\n* [[Adiabatic process]]: occurs without loss or gain of energy by [[heat]]\n* [[Isenthalpic process]]: occurs at a constant [[enthalpy]]\n* [[Isentropic process]]: a reversible adiabatic process, occurs at a constant [[entropy]]\n* [[Isobaric process]]: occurs at constant [[pressure]]\n* [[Isochoric process]]: occurs at constant [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (also called isometric/isovolumetric)\n* [[Isothermal process]]: occurs at a constant [[temperature]]\n* [[steady state|Steady state process]]: occurs without a change in the [[internal energy]]\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThere are two types of [[thermodynamic instruments]], the '''meter''' and the '''reservoir'''. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a [[thermodynamic system]]. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics|zeroth law]] states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] in 1872, asserts that it is possible to measure temperature. An idealized [[thermometer]] is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the [[ideal gas law]] ''pV=nRT'', the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a [[barometer]] may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A [[calorimeter]] is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system.\n\nA thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that its state parameters are not appreciably altered when it is brought into contact with the system of interest. When the reservoir is brought into contact with the system, the system is brought into equilibrium with the reservoir. For example, a pressure reservoir is a system at a particular pressure, which imposes that pressure upon the system to which it is mechanically connected. The Earth's atmosphere is often used as a pressure reservoir. If ocean water is used to cool a power plant, the ocean is often  a temperature reservoir in the analysis of the power plant cycle.\n\n== Conjugate variables ==\n{{Main|Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|l1=Conjugate variables}}\n\nThe central concept of thermodynamics is that of [[energy]], the ability to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. By the [[first law of thermodynamics|First Law]], the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In [[mechanics]], for example, energy transfer equals the product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.\n\n[[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|Conjugate variables]] are pairs of thermodynamic concepts, with the first being akin to a \"force\" applied to some [[thermodynamic system]], the second being akin to the resulting \"displacement,\" and the product of the two equalling the amount of energy transferred. The common conjugate variables are:\n* [[Pressure]]-[[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (the [[Mechanics|mechanical]] parameters);\n* [[Temperature]]-[[entropy]] (thermal parameters);\n* [[Chemical potential]]-[[particle number]] (material parameters).\n\n== Potentials ==\n[[Thermodynamic potential]]s are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure the energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state.  The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure.  For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively.\n\nThe five most well known potentials are:\n{{table of thermodynamic potentials}}\n\nwhere <math>T</math> is the [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]], <math>S</math> the [[entropy]], <math>p</math> the [[pressure]], <math>V</math> the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], <math>\\mu</math> the [[chemical potential]], <math>N</math> the number of particles in the system, and <math>i</math> is the count of particles types in the system.\n\nThermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through [[Legendre transformation]].\n\n== Applied fields ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n* [[Biological thermodynamics]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics]]\n* [[Chemical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Classical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|Equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* [[Industrial ecology]] (re: [[Exergy]])\n* [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* [[Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]]\n* [[Psychrometrics]]\n* [[Quantum thermodynamics]]\n* [[Statistical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Thermoeconomics]]\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Physics}}\n* [[Thermodynamic process path]]\n\n===Lists and timelines===\n* [[List of important publications in physics#Thermodynamics|List of important publications in thermodynamics]]\n* [[List of textbooks in statistical mechanics|List of textbooks on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics]]\n* [[List of thermal conductivities]]\n* [[List of thermodynamic properties]]\n* [[Table of thermodynamic equations]]\n* [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author1=Goldstein, Martin|author2=Inge F.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Refrigerator and the Universe|url=https://archive.org/details/refrigeratoruniv0000gold|url-access=registration|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-674-75325-9|location=|pages=|oclc=32826343}} A nontechnical introduction, good on historical and interpretive matters.\n* {{cite journal |last1=Kazakov |first1=Andrei |last2=Muzny |first2=Chris D. |last3=Chirico |first3=Robert D. |last4=Diky |first4=Vladimir V. |last5=Frenkel |first5=Michael |title=Web Thermo Tables \u2013 an On-Line Version of the TRC Thermodynamic Tables |journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology |volume=113 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=209\u2013220 |issn=1044-677X |doi=10.6028/jres.113.016 |pmc=4651616 |pmid=27096122}}\n* {{cite book|author=Gibbs J.W.|title=The Collected Works of J.

He was known for diverging from classical Marxism in his breakdown of the working class into subgroups of diversely held power and therefore varying degrees of class consciousness. Wright introduced novel concepts to adapt to this change of perspective including deep democracy and [[interstitial revolution]].<ref name=\"utopias\" />\n\n== Personal life and career ==\nErik Olin Wright was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] though he was raised in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].

Among Wright's supporters were [[Harrison White]], who respected Wright's work despite opposition to Wright's Marxist political commitments.

In addition, he attempted to develop class categories that would allow researchers to compare and contrast the class structures and dynamics of different [[Advanced capitalism|advanced capitalist]] and \"[[post-capitalist]]\" societies.\n\nWright has stressed the importance of:\n# control over and exclusion from access to economic/productive resources;\n# location within production relations;\n# market capacity in exchange relations;\n# differential control over income derived from the use of productive resources; and,\n# differential control over labor effort in defining 'class', while at the same time trying to account for the situation of expert, skilled, manager, and supervisory employees, taking inspiration from [[Max Weber|Weberian]] accounts of class and class analysis.\n\nAccording to Wright, employees with sought-after and reward-inelastically supplied skills (due to natural scarcities or socially constructed and imposed restrictions on supply, such as licensing, barriers to entry into training programs, etc.) are in a \"privileged [surplus] appropriation location within exploitation relations\" because, while they are not capitalists, they are able to obtain more privileges through their relation to the owner of the means of production than less skilled workers and harder to monitor and evaluate in terms of labor effort. The owner(s) of the means of production or their employer in general therefore has to pay them a \"scarcity\" or \"skill/credential\" rent (thus raising their compensation above the actual cost of producing and reproducing their [[Labour power|labor power]]) and tries to \"buy\" their loyalty by giving them ownership stakes, endowing them with delegated authority over their fellow workers and/or allowing them to more or less be autonomous in determining the pace and direction of their work. Thus, experts, managers of experts, and executive managers tend to be closer to the interests of the employers than to other workers.\n\nErik Olin Wright's books include ''Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis'' (Cambridge, 1997), which uses data collected in various industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, Norway, and Sweden. He was a professor of sociology at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] until his death.\n\n=== Real utopias ===\nLater in his career, Wright was associated with a renewed understanding of a [[socialism|socialist]] alternative, deeply rooted on social [[associativism]].<ref name=\"RU\" /> The transition to this alternative, according to Wright, depends on designing and building \"[[Real utopian sociology|real utopias]]\", the name of a research project and book of his. Examples of \"real utopias\" that counter prevailing institutions by advancing democratic and egalitarian principles, thereby pointing in the direction of a more just and humane world, include [[Wikipedia]] and the [[Mondragon Corporation]].\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book | last = Wright | first = Erik Olin | title = The politics of punishment: a critical analysis of

23, 2019) was an [[United States|American]] [[Analytical Marxism|analytical Marxist]] [[sociology|sociologist]] and educator, specializing in [[social stratification]], and in egalitarian alternative futures to [[capitalism]]. He was known for diverging from classical Marxism in his breakdown of the working class into subgroups of diversely held power and therefore varying degrees of class consciousness. Wright introduced novel concepts to adapt to this change of perspective including deep democracy and [[interstitial revolution]].<ref name=\"utopias\" />\n\n== Personal life and career ==\nErik Olin Wright was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] though he was raised in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. Wright's parents were both psychology professors at the [[University of Kansas]].<ref name=ssobit>{{cite web |url=https://www.socialsciencespace.com/2019/01/the-pragmatic-utopian-erik-olin-wright-1947-2019/ |title=The Pragmatic Utopian: Erik Olin Wright, 1947-2019 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=January 28, 2019 |website=Social Science Space |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>  His parents were both Jewish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} He received two B.A. degrees, one from [[Harvard College]] in 1968, and one from [[Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford]] in 1970.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Wright received a Ph.D. from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1976.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} He became a Professor of Sociology at [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]]<ref name=\"cv\" /> in 1976.<ref name=\"frankfurt\" />\n\nWright began making contributions to the intellectual community in the mid-1970s, along with a whole generation of young academics who were radicalized by the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[civil rights movement]].<ref name=\"ritzer\" />\n\nAt the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wright supervised the dissertations of numerous young scholars who proceeded to become notable sociologists and politicians, among whom are included [[Wilmot James]], [[C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez Garavito]], and [[Vivek Chibber]].<ref name=dissent /> Wright also served on the dissertation committees of scholars who go on to make considerable contributions to the fields of [[social stratification]], social policy, and inequality including [[G\u00f8sta Esping-Andersen]], former American Sociological Association president [[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]], and the late [[Devah Pager]].\n\nThroughout Wright's career, he was solicited by other universities to join their sociology faculty.<ref name=dissent /> One notable such recruitment attempt occurred at [[Harvard University]] in 1981. Among Wright's supporters were [[Harrison White]], who respected Wright's work despite opposition to Wright's Marxist political commitments. Wright's opponents at Harvard included [[Daniel Bell]] and [[George Homans]], as well as university president [[Derek Bok]] who purportedly blocked the department's attempt to recruit Wright.<ref name=nyttenure>{{cite news |last=Schumer |first=Fran R. |date=October 18, 1981 |title=A Question of Sex Bias at Harvard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/magazine/a-question-of-sex-bias-at-harvard.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |access-date= }}</ref> Harvard's attempt to recruit Wright coincided with its decision to deny tenure in 1981 to [[Theda Skocpol]], a decision that was later reversed following controversy over accusations of gender discrimination.<ref name=nytskocpol>{{cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |date=January 8, 1985 |title=Harvard Reverses Tenure Decision |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/us/harvard-reverses-tenure-decision.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |access-date= }}</ref> \n\nIn 2012, Wright was elected President of the [[American Sociological Association]].<ref name=\"conf\" />\n\nWright died on January 23, 2019, from [[acute myeloid leukemia]] at a hospital in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], aged 71.<ref name=dissent /><ref name=\"madison\" />\n\nWright was also an avid [[fiddle]] player, often encouraging guests to [[square dance]] at parties.<ref name=\"tribute\" />\n\n== Thought ==\n{{original research|section|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Social classes ===\nWright has been described as an \"influential [[new left]] theorist\".<ref name=\"meiksins\" /> His work was concerned mainly with the study of [[social class]]es, and in particular with the task of providing an update to and elaboration of the [[Marxist]] concept of class, in order to enable Marxist and non-Marxist researchers alike to use \"class\" to explain and predict people's material interests, lived experiences, living conditions, incomes, organizational capacities and willingness to engage in [[collective action]], political leanings, and so on. In addition, he attempted to develop class categories that would allow researchers to compare and contrast the class structures and dynamics of different [[Advanced capitalism|advanced capitalist]] and \"[[post-capitalist]]\" societies.\n\nWright has stressed the importance of:\n# control over and exclusion from access to economic/productive resources;\n# location within production relations;\n# market capacity in exchange relations;\n# differential control over income derived from the use of productive resources; and,\n# differential control over labor effort in defining 'class', while at the same time trying to account for the situation of expert, skilled, manager, and supervisory employees, taking inspiration from [[Max Weber|Weberian]] accounts of class and class analysis.\n\nAccording to Wright, employees with sought-after and reward-inelastically supplied skills (due to natural scarcities or socially constructed and imposed restrictions on supply, such as licensing, barriers to entry into training programs, etc.) are in a \"privileged [surplus] appropriation location within exploitation relations\" because, while they are not capitalists, they are able to obtain more privileges through their relation to the owner of the means of production than less skilled workers and harder to monitor and evaluate in terms of labor effort. The owner(s) of the means of production or their employer in general therefore has to pay them a \"scarcity\" or \"skill/credential\" rent (thus raising their compensation above the actual cost of producing and reproducing their [[Labour power|labor power]]) and tries to \"buy\" their loyalty by giving them ownership stakes, endowing them with delegated authority over their fellow workers and/or allowing them to more or less be autonomous in determining the pace and direction of their work. Thus, experts, managers of experts, and executive managers tend to be closer to the interests of the employers than to other workers.\n\nErik Olin Wright's books include ''Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis'' (Cambridge, 1997), which uses data collected in various industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, Norway, and Sweden. He was a professor of sociology at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] until his death.\n\n=== Real utopias ===\nLater in his career, Wright was associated with a renewed understanding of a [[socialism|socialist]] alternative, deeply rooted on social [[associativism]].<ref name=\"RU\" /> The transition to this alternative, according to Wright, depends on designing and building \"[[Real utopian sociology|real utopias]]\", the name of a research project and book of his. Examples of \"real utopias\" that counter prevailing institutions by advancing democratic and egalitarian principles, thereby pointing in the direction of a more just and humane world, include [[Wikipedia]] and the [[Mondragon Corporation]].\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book | last = Wright | first = Erik Olin | title = The politics of punishment: a critical analysis of
