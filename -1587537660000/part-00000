According to {{UN Population|source}}, the population stood at {{UN Population|Bangladesh}} in 2016.\n\n[[Bangladesh]] (Previously [[East Pakistan]] between 1947 and 1971 and [[East Bengal]] before 1947) is largely [[Ethnic group|ethnically]] homogeneous, and its name derives from the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] ethno-linguistic group which comprises 98% of the [[Bangladeshi people|population]]. The [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], [[Sylhet]], [[Mymensingh]] and [[Rajshahi Division|North Bengal]] divisions are home to diverse [[Indigenous peoples in Bangladesh|indigenous peoples]]. There are many dialects of Bengali spoken throughout the region. The dialect spoken by those in [[Chittagong]] and Sylhet are particularly distinctive. The population is estimated at {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Bangladesh}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million ({{UN_Population|Year}}{{UN_Population|ref}}). About 89% of Bangladeshis are Muslims, followed by Hindus (10\n.7%), Buddhists (0.6%) and Christians (0.4%) and others.\n\nBangladesh has [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|one of the highest population densities]] in the world. The total fertility rate (TFR) has been reduced by more than two thirds since Independence. Current TFR in Bangladesh is 2.1 which means that women have 2.1 children on average in their lifetime. At this TFR and without migration, country's population will eventually be neither growing nor shrinking, once the top of its age pyramid fills in.<ref>{{cite news |title=Healthy Change|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/how-bangladesh-reduced-average-number-children-woman-mere-21|author=Najma Rizvi|website=Dandc.eu|date=16 June 2018 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Pyramide Bangladesh.PNG|thumb|left|Age-sex pyramid for Bangladesh, 2005]] The 2016 total population was {{UN Population|Bangladesh}} which makes Bangladesh the  [[List of countries and dependencies by population|eighth-most populous country]] in the world.\n\n===Census===\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://203.112.218.65/WebTestApplication/userfiles/Image/BBS/PHC2011Preliminary%20Result.pdf|title=2016 Population & Housing Census: Preliminary Results|website=203.112.218.65|accessdate=23 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425161708/http://203.112.218.65/WebTestApplication/userfiles/Image/BBS/PHC2011Preliminary%20Result.pdf|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bangladesh population 1900to2010.svg|thumb|right|350px|Demographic evolution of the territory of Bangladesh (1900-2010).]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n'''Population of Bangladesh'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

The [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], [[Sylhet]], [[Mymensingh]] and [[Rajshahi Division|North Bengal]] divisions are home to diverse [[Indigenous peoples in Bangladesh|indigenous peoples]]. There are many dialects of Bengali spoken throughout the region. The dialect spoken by those in [[Chittagong]] and Sylhet are particularly distinctive. The population is estimated at {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Bangladesh}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million ({{UN_Population|Year}}{{UN_Population|ref}}).

The total fertility rate (TFR) has been reduced by more than two thirds since Independence. Current TFR in Bangladesh is 2.1 which means that women have 2.1 children on average in their lifetime. At this TFR and without migration, country's population will eventually be neither growing nor shrinking, once the top of its age pyramid fills in.<ref>{{cite news |title=Healthy Change|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/how-bangladesh-reduced-average-number-children-woman-mere-21|author=Najma Rizvi|website=Dandc.eu|date=16 June 2018 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Pyramide Bangladesh.PNG|thumb|left|Age-sex pyramid for Bangladesh, 2005]] The 2016 total population was {{UN Population|Bangladesh}} which makes Bangladesh the  [[List of countries and dependencies by population|eighth-most populous country]] in the world.\n\n===Census===\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://203.112.218.65/WebTestApplication/userfiles/Image/BBS/PHC2011Preliminary%20Result.pdf|title=2016 Population & Housing Census: Preliminary Results|website=203.112.218.65|accessdate=23 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425161708/http://203.112.218.65/WebTestApplication/userfiles/Image/BBS/PHC2011Preliminary%20Result.pdf|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bangladesh population 1900to2010.svg|thumb|right|350px|Demographic evolution of the territory of Bangladesh (1900-2010).]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n'''Population of Bangladesh'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, that was not the end of Yasin's ordeal, as he was charged with raping Poon and brought back to court. At the trial, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial on 12 May 1977, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to serve another 8 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, that was not the end of Yasin's ordeal, as he was charged with raping Poon and brought back to court. At the trial, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and this jail sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death, making Yasin having to spend a total of 10 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

The ''Kissa Yojoki'' (\u55ab\u8336\u990a\u751f\u8a18 ''Book of Tea''), written by [[Zen]] priest [[Eisai]] in 1211, describes how drinking green tea may affect five vital [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], the shapes of tea plants, flowers and leaves, and how to grow and process tea leaves.\n\n==Steeping, brewing and serving==\n[[File:Four GreenTeas in White Bowls -1 (6196131680).jpg|alt=Four small white bowls of tea|thumb|Four varieties of green tea prior to brewing]]\n[[File:Green Tea Color.jpg|thumb|The color of green tea brewed for 3 minutes at {{Convert|90|C}}]]\n[[Steeping]], or brewing, is the process of making tea from leaves and hot water, generally using {{Convert|2|g|}} of tea per {{Convert|100|mL|}} of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) or about 1 teaspoon of green tea per 150 ml cup.  Steeping temperatures range from {{Convert|61|C|}} to {{Convert|87|C|}} and steeping times from 30 seconds to three minutes.\n\nGenerally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually multiple times (2-3 typically). Higher-quality teas like [[gyokuro]] use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations. Steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of [[Tannins in tea|tannins]], leading to a bitter, [[astringent]] brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew's taste is also affected by the steeping technique; two important ones are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down, and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water during consumption.The final major contribution to the quality of tea is the method of brewing. If brewed / taut in water at high temperatures, it will not destroy the fragrant aroma of green tea, and produces a very bitter drink. Likewise, if left too long, the tea leaves will begin to release tannins, thus yielding a bitter and hard product.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yogaandarurveda.blogspot.com/2019/11/how-to-take-green-tea-to-get-great.html|title=How to take green tea to get great benefits|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Extracts==\n\n[[Polyphenol]]s found in green tea include [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (EGCG), [[epicatechin gallate]], [[epicatechin]]s and [[flavanol]]s,<ref name=Khan2013/> which are under laboratory research for their potential effects [[in vivo]].<ref name=Johnson/> Other components include three kinds of [[flavonoid]]s, known as [[kaempferol]], [[quercetin]], and [[myricetin]].<ref>Committee on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer, Assembly of Life Sciences, National Research Council, Diet, nutrition, and cancer, Washington: D.C National Academies Press, 1982, p. 286.</ref> Although the mean content of [[flavonoid]]s and [[catechins]] in a cup of green tea is higher than that in the same volume of other food and drink items that are traditionally considered to promote health,<ref name=\"USDA_2007\">USDA Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods, Release 2.1 (2007)</ref> flavonoids and catechins have no proven biological effect in humans.<ref name=efsa/><ref name=\"EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies NDA2, 3 European Food Safety Authority EFSA, Parma, Italy 2010 1489\">{{cite journal|authors=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)2, 3 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Parma, Italy|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061|journal= EFSA Journal|year= 2010|volume= 8|issue=2|page=1489|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nConsumption of green tea extract is linked to [[hepatotoxicity]] and liver failure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarma DN, Barrett ML, Chavez ML|display-authors=etal | title = Safety of green tea extracts: a systematic review by the US Pharmacopeia| journal = Drug Saf | date = 2008 | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 469\u2013484| doi = 10.2165/00002018-200831060-00003| pmid = 18484782}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://livertox.nih.gov/GreenTea.htm | title = Green Tea | work = LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury | publisher = National Institutes of Health | quote = Green tea extract and, more rarely, ingestion of large amounts of green tea have been implicated in cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury, including instances of acute liver failure and either need for urgent liver transplantation or death.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Chalasani, N., Fontana, R.

processed and grown in a variety of ways, depending on the type of green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of [[polyphenol]]s and [[volatile organic compounds]] are retained, affecting aroma and taste. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types \u2212 those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and in general are harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. It is the first flush in the spring that brings the best-quality leaves, with higher prices to match.\n\nGreen tea is processed using either artisanal or modern methods. Sun-drying, basket or charcoal firing, or pan-firing are common artisanal methods. Oven-drying, tumbling, or steaming are common modern methods.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=56\u201369}} Processed green teas, known as ''[[aracha]]'', are stored under low humidity refrigeration in 30- or 60-kg paper bags at {{convert|0|-|5|C|F}}. This aracha has yet to be refined at this stage, with a final firing taking place before [[Tea blending and additives|blending]], selection and packaging take place. The leaves in this state will be re-fired throughout the year as they are needed, giving the green teas a longer shelf-life and better flavor.

During the [[Heian period]] (794\u20131185), [[Emperor Saga]] introduced the practice of drinking tea to the imperial family. The [[Zen]] Buddhist priest [[Eisai]] (1141\u20131215), founder of the [[Rinzai school]] of Buddhism, brought tea seeds from China to plant in various places in Japan. Eisai advocated that all people, not just Buddhist monks and the elite, drink tea for its health benefits.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\nThe oldest tea-producing region in Japan is [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]], located near the former capital of [[Kyoto]].{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=164\u2013166}} It is thought that seeds sent by Eisai were planted in Uji, becoming the basis of the tea industry there.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Today, Japan's most expensive premium teas are still grown in Uji.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=176\u2013179}} The largest tea-producing area today is [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], which accounts for 40% of total Japanese [[sencha]] production.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=156}}{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=176\u2013179}} Other major tea-producing regions include the island of [[Kyushu]] and the prefectures of [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] in central [[Honshu]].{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=176\u2013179}}\n\nAll commercial tea produced in Japan today is green tea,{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=169\u2013170}} though for a brief period black tea was also produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Japanese tea production is heavily mechanized, and is characterized by the use of modern technology and processes to improve yields and reduce labor. Because of the high cost of labor in Japan, only the highest quality teas are plucked and processed by hand in the traditional fashion.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\nJapanese green teas have a thin, needle-like shape and a rich, dark green color. Unlike Chinese teas, most Japanese teas are produced by steaming rather than pan firing. This produces their characteristic color, and creates a sweeter, more grassy flavor. A mechanical rolling/drying process then dries the tea leaves into their final shape.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=169\u2013170}} The liquor of steamed Japanese tea tends to be cloudy due to the higher quantity of dissolved solids.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=68}}\n\nMost Japanese teas are blended from leaves grown in different regions, with less emphasis on terroir than in the Chinese market. Because of the limited quantity of tea that can be produced in Japan, the majority of production is dedicated to the premium tea market. Bottled tea and tea-flavored food products usually use lower-grade Japanese-style tea produced in China.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nAlthough a variety of commercial tea cultivars exist in Japan, the vast majority of Japanese tea is produced using the ''Yabukita'' cultivar developed in the 1950s.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=157}}\n\nPopular Japanese green teas include:\n* ''[[Bancha]]''<br/> A lower-grade tea plucked from the same bushes used to produce ''sencha''. It has a somewhat bolder flavor, and is plucked each season after ''sencha'' production is finished.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=179}}\n* ''[[Genmaicha]]''<br/> Made by combining ''sencha'' tea leaves with toasted puffs of rice.\n* ''[[Gyokuro]]''<br/> Grown under shade for three weeks prior to plucking, ''gyokuro'' is one of the most exclusive varieties of tea produced in Japan.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=162}} The shading technique imparts a sweeter flavor, and produces a particularly rich color thanks to the higher amounts of [[chlorophyll]] in the shaded leaf. ''Gyokuro'' tea is associated with the Uji region, the first tea-growing region in Japan. It is often made using smaller-leaf cultivars of the tea plant.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=182\u2013183}}\n* ''[[H\u014djicha]]''<br/> This type of tea is made by roasting ''sencha'' or ''bancha'' leaves with ''kukicha'' twigs.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=185}}\n* ''[[Kabusecha]]''<br/> Similar to ''gyokuro'', kabusecha is shaded for only a week prior to plucking. Its flavor is somewhat between that of ''gyokuro'' and normal ''sencha''.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=162}}{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=182\u2013183}}\n* ''[[Kukicha]]''<br/> A blended tea made of ''sencha'' leaves and stems.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=187}}\n* ''[[Matcha]]''<br/> Like ''gyokuro'', ''matcha'' is shaded before plucking. The plucked and processed leaf is called ''tencha''. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is ''matcha''. Because the tea powder is very perishable, ''matcha'' is usually sold in small quantities. It is typically rather expensive.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=185}} ''Matcha'' is the type of tea used in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. It is prepared by whisking the tea with hot water in a bowl, until the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter.{{sfn|Battle|2017|pp=163\u2013164}}\n* ''[[Sencha]]''<br/> This type of tea is produced throughout the tea season, and is the standard style today, representing 80% of all tea produced in Japan.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=182}} 90% of ''sencha'' is grown from the ''Yabukita'' cultivar.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=157}}\n* ''[[Shincha]]''<br/> The first early harvest of tea, plucked before the first flush, is called ''shincha''. ''Shincha'' is made from the youngest new growth leaves, and is plucked from early April to early May. ''Shincha'' typically refers to the early harvest of ''sencha'', but can refer to any type of tea plucked early in the season, before the main harvest. Because of the limited quantities in which it is produced, ''shincha'' is highly prized and expensive to obtain.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=171}}\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{Infobox Korean name\n| title     =

The ''Kissa Yojoki'' (\u55ab\u8336\u990a\u751f\u8a18 ''Book of Tea''), written by [[Zen]] priest [[Eisai]] in 1211, describes how drinking green tea may affect five vital [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], the shapes of tea plants, flowers and leaves, and how to grow and process tea leaves.\n\n==Steeping, brewing and serving==\n[[File:Four GreenTeas in White Bowls -1 (6196131680).jpg|alt=Four small white bowls of tea|thumb|Four varieties of green tea prior to brewing]]\n[[File:Green Tea Color.jpg|thumb|The color of green tea brewed for 3 minutes at {{Convert|90|C}}]]\n[[Steeping]], or brewing, is the process of making tea from leaves and hot water, generally using {{Convert|2|g|}} of tea per {{Convert|100|mL|}} of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) or about 1 teaspoon of green tea per 150 ml cup.  Steeping temperatures range from {{Convert|61|C|}} to {{Convert|87|C|}} and steeping times from 30 seconds to three minutes.\n\nGenerally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually multiple times (2-3 typically). Higher-quality teas like [[gyokuro]] use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations. Steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of [[Tannins in tea|tannins]], leading to a bitter, [[astringent]] brew, regardless of initial quality.

processed and grown in a variety of ways, depending on the type of green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of [[polyphenol]]s and [[volatile organic compounds]] are retained, affecting aroma and taste. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types \u2212 those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and in general are harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. It is the first flush in the spring that brings the best-quality leaves, with higher prices to match.\n\nGreen tea is processed using either artisanal or modern methods. Sun-drying, basket or charcoal firing, or pan-firing are common artisanal methods. Oven-drying, tumbling, or steaming are common modern methods.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=56\u201369}} Processed green teas, known as ''[[aracha]]'', are stored under low humidity refrigeration in 30- or 60-kg paper bags at {{convert|0|-|5|C|F}}. This aracha has yet to be refined at this stage, with a final firing taking place before [[Tea blending and additives|blending]], selection and packaging take place. The leaves in this state will be re-fired throughout the year as they are needed, giving the green teas a longer shelf-life and better flavor. The first flush tea of May will readily store in this fashion until the next year's harvest. After this re-drying process, each crude tea will be sifted and graded according to size.

During the [[Heian period]] (794\u20131185), [[Emperor Saga]] introduced the practice of drinking tea to the imperial family. The [[Zen]] Buddhist priest [[Eisai]] (1141\u20131215), founder of the [[Rinzai school]] of Buddhism, brought tea seeds from China to plant in various places in Japan. Eisai advocated that all people, not just Buddhist monks and the elite, drink tea for its health benefits.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\nThe oldest tea-producing region in Japan is [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]], located near the former capital of [[Kyoto]].{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=164\u2013166}} It is thought that seeds sent by Eisai were planted in Uji, becoming the basis of the tea industry there.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Today, Japan's most expensive premium teas are still grown in Uji.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=176\u2013179}} The largest tea-producing area today is [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], which accounts for 40% of total Japanese [[sencha]] production.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=156}}{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=176\u2013179}} Other major tea-producing regions include the island of [[Kyushu]] and the prefectures of [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] in central [[Honshu]].{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=176\u2013179}}\n\nAll commercial tea produced in Japan today is green tea,{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=169\u2013170}} though for a brief period black tea was also produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Japanese tea production is heavily mechanized, and is characterized by the use of modern technology and processes to improve yields and reduce labor. Because of the high cost of labor in Japan, only the highest quality teas are plucked and processed by hand in the traditional fashion.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\nJapanese green teas have a thin, needle-like shape and a rich, dark green color. Unlike Chinese teas, most Japanese teas are produced by steaming rather than pan firing. This produces their characteristic color, and creates a sweeter, more grassy flavor. A mechanical rolling/drying process then dries the tea leaves into their final shape.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=169\u2013170}} The liquor of steamed Japanese tea tends to be cloudy due to the higher quantity of dissolved solids.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=68}}\n\nMost Japanese teas are blended from leaves grown in different regions, with less emphasis on terroir than in the Chinese market. Because of the limited quantity of tea that can be produced in Japan, the majority of production is dedicated to the premium tea market. Bottled tea and tea-flavored food products usually use lower-grade Japanese-style tea produced in China.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nAlthough a variety of commercial tea cultivars exist in Japan, the vast majority of Japanese tea is produced using the ''Yabukita'' cultivar developed in the 1950s.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=157}}\n\nPopular Japanese green teas include:\n* ''[[Bancha]]''<br/> A lower-grade tea plucked from the same bushes used to produce ''sencha''. It has a somewhat bolder flavor, and is plucked each season after ''sencha'' production is finished.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=179}}\n* ''[[Genmaicha]]''<br/> Made by combining ''sencha'' tea leaves with toasted puffs of rice.\n* ''[[Gyokuro]]''<br/> Grown under shade for three weeks prior to plucking, ''gyokuro'' is one of the most exclusive varieties of tea produced in Japan.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=162}} The shading technique imparts a sweeter flavor, and produces a particularly rich color thanks to the higher amounts of [[chlorophyll]] in the shaded leaf. ''Gyokuro'' tea is associated with the Uji region, the first tea-growing region in Japan. It is often made using smaller-leaf cultivars of the tea plant.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=182\u2013183}}\n* ''[[H\u014djicha]]''<br/> This type of tea is made by roasting ''sencha'' or ''bancha'' leaves with ''kukicha'' twigs.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=185}}\n* ''[[Kabusecha]]''<br/> Similar to ''gyokuro'', kabusecha is shaded for only a week prior to plucking. Its flavor is somewhat between that of ''gyokuro'' and normal ''sencha''.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=162}}{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=182\u2013183}}\n* ''[[Kukicha]]''<br/> A blended tea made of ''sencha'' leaves and stems.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=187}}\n* ''[[Matcha]]''<br/> Like ''gyokuro'', ''matcha'' is shaded before plucking. The plucked and processed leaf is called ''tencha''. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is ''matcha''. Because the tea powder is very perishable, ''matcha'' is usually sold in small quantities. It is typically rather expensive.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=185}} ''Matcha'' is the type of tea used in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. It is prepared by whisking the tea with hot water in a bowl, until the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter.{{sfn|Battle|2017|pp=163\u2013164}}\n* ''[[Sencha]]''<br/> This type of tea is produced throughout the tea season, and is the standard style today, representing 80% of all tea produced in Japan.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=182}} 90% of ''sencha'' is grown from the ''Yabukita'' cultivar.{{sfn|Battle|2017|p=157}}\n* ''[[Shincha]]''<br/> The first early harvest of tea, plucked before the first flush, is called ''shincha''. ''Shincha'' is made from the youngest new growth leaves, and is plucked from early April to early May. ''Shincha'' typically refers to the early harvest of ''sencha'', but can refer to any type of tea plucked early in the season, before the main harvest. Because of the limited quantities in which it is produced, ''shincha'' is highly prized and expensive to obtain.{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|p=171}}\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{Infobox Korean name\n| title     =
