It forms the eastern part of [[Woolwich]].\n\n==History==\n\nPlumstead is in the [[historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Kent]] and the detail of much of its early history can be found in [[Edward Hasted]]'s extensive history of Kent.<ref>Hasted, Edward: \"History and Topgraphical Survey of the County of Kent - Second Edition - Volume II\", pages 203-227. Bristow, Canterbury, 1798</ref> \n\n===10th and 11th century===\nIn 960 King [[Edgar I of England|Edgar]] gave four plough lands, collectively called Plumstead, to a monastery - [[St Augustine's Abbey]] near [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]]. These were subsequently taken from the monastery by [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]] for his fourth son, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]].\n\nKing [[Edward the Confessor]] restored them again to the monastery on taking power, however Tostig saw the opportunity to take possession of them once again after Edward's death in 1066 when [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]] seized his brother's estates.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gifted Plumstead to his half-brother [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]] whom he also titled [[Earl of Kent]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Lanfranc of Pavia]] and the [[Normans|Norman]] abbot of St Austin's successfully interceded to reclaim a portion of the land on behalf of the monastery. In 1074 Odo then granted by deed the remainder of the parish and also the right of the abbot to be \"Chief Lord of the Fee\".<ref>Anon: \"Registry of the Monastery of St Augustine\", Cart 163 & 200, Decim Script col 1779, 1787. Canterbury.</ref>\n\n====Domesday book====\nHowever, the [[Domesday book]]<ref>Various: \"Domesday/The Book of Winchester\". 1080</ref> of 1080 holds the details of Plumstead as two separate entries. Under the title of the land of the church of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine]] it reads \n<blockquote>\n''\"In [[Little and Lesnes Hundred|Litelai hundred]]. The abbot of St. Augustine has 1 manor, named Plumstede, which was taxed at 2 sulings and 1 yoke. The arable lands is ... In demesne there is 1 carucate and 17 villeins, with 6 cottagers, having 6 carucates, there is wood for the pannage of 5 hogs. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, and afterwards it was worth 10 pounds, now 12 pounds, and yet it pays 14 pounds and 8 shillings and 3 pence.\"''\n</blockquote>\nwhile under the general title of the Bishop of Baieux's lands\n<blockquote>\n''\"The abbot of St. Augustine holds of the bishop of Baieux, Plumsted.

It was found by a jury of grand assizes that his ancestors held this land in tenancy from the abbot and convent at a rent of twelve pound per annum.\n\n===14th century===\nIn 1314, during the reign of [[Edward II of England]], the abbot was summoned before [[Hervey de Stanton]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He was asked to show by what right he claimed sundry liberties and [[free warren]] on the manor of Plumstead amongst others. Other questions included the right for a weekly market in Plumstead on a Wednesday and a fair yearly for three days \"on the Eve day, and morrow of [[St. Nicholas]]\".\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, [[King Edward III]] exempted the men and tenants of the manor of Plumstead from providing four men from the borough for the [[sheriff]] as was the requirement elsewhere. A writ to Roger de Reynham, Sheriff of Kent in 1332 directed and commanded him that the residents of Plumstead should be allowed to send one man only. By 1363 Edward also decreed to the monastery in his charter of infpeximus that he released all manors and possessions given to it by former kings, including [[William the Conqueror]]. He also confirmed all the grants of liberties previously bestowed on the abbot and monastery.\n\nBy the time of [[Richard II of England]] the taxes from Plumstead were valued at 69 pounds, 10 shillings and sixpence,<ref>Anon: \"Registry of the Monastery of St Augustine\", Cart ?, Decim Script col 2054,2123,2129,2163.

In the late 19th century, [[Woolwich cemetery]] was developed in two phases (1856, 1855) on land formerly part of the southern edge of the Common.\n\nPlumstead was also the home of the [[Peculiar People]] and a fascinating account of this Protestant sect is recorded in 'Unorthodox London' by the journalist Dr Davis. The [[Plymouth Brethren]] have had numerous meeting rooms in the area since about 1845. The present Brethren meeting places are at Plum Lane (1865), Willenhall Road (ca 1910) and Brewery Road (Richmond Gospel Hall). [[Quaker]]s met nearby in Woolwich from 1905, and in their own Meeting House from 1924.\n\n===20th century===\nPlumstead had rapid housing growth but still retained large areas of green land i.e. Winns Common, Plumstead Common, Shrewsbury Park and Rockcliffe Gardens. The urban sprawl of lower Plumstead adjacent to Woolwich was not initially matched by upper Plumstead and is full of dirty girls that sleep about for a pound note.\n\n== Plumstead Common ==\nThe 1878 Plumstead Common Act protected [[Plumstead Common]] as public open space forever.\n\n==Education==\n[[Plumstead Manor School]] was a girls school, but since September 2018 has been accepting both genders is located in the area. The school was first established as Plumstead County School for Girls in 1913, and was later renamed Kings Warren Grammar School before becoming a [[comprehensive school]] in 1967.\n\nThere are a number of primary schools in Plumstead including St.Patricks RC Primary School, Gallions Mount Primary School, Timbercroft Primary School, Bannockburn Primary School, Plumcroft Primary School, Greenslade Primary School and Conway Primary School.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]] (then known as Royal Arsenal or Woolwich Arsenal) played in Plumstead between 1886 and 1913, at various grounds in the Plumstead area, but mainly at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]], on the north side of Plumstead High Street and the [[Invicta Ground]], where the [[Royal Ordnance Factories F.C.]] also played.\n\n==Transport==\n===Rail===\n[[Plumstead railway station]] serves the area with [[National Rail]] services to [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]] via [[Lewisham railway station|Lewisham]], [[Cannon Street railway station|London Cannon Street]] via [[Greenwich railway station|Greenwich]], London Cannon Street via [[Bexleyheath railway station|Bexleyheath]], London Cannon Street via [[Sidcup railway station|Sidcup]], [[Kentish Town railway station|Kentish Town]] via Greenwich, [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]] and [[Rainham railway station (Kent)|Rainham]].\n\n===Buses===\nPlumstead is served by many bus routes provided by [[Transport for London]].

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up

[[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural

humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''.<ref name=\"CoronavirusStudyGroup\" />\n\n===Structural biology===\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|alt=Figure of a spherical SARSr-CoV virion showing locations of structural proteins forming the viral envelope and the inner nucleocapsid|thumb|right|Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion]]\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 [[virion]] is approximately 50\u2013200 [[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N ([[nucleocapsid]]) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the [[viral envelope]].<ref name=\"WuStructure\" /> The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using [[cryogenic electron microscopy]],<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"GZM-20200220\" /> is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell.<ref name=\"WuStructure\" />\n\n[[File:6VSB spike protein SARS-CoV-2 monomer in homotrimer.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted; ACE2 binding domain highlighted|SARS-CoV-2 spike [[homotrimer]] with one [[protein subunit]] highlighted; ACE2 binding domain in magenta]]\n\n[[Protein structure prediction|Protein modeling]] experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of [[Viral entry|cell entry]].<ref name=\"SCLSModeling\" /> By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using [[reverse genetics]] methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"Letko22Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NatMicLetko\" /><ref name=\"ElSahly\" /><ref name=\"Gralinski2020\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /> SARS-CoV-2 may also use [[basigin]] to gain cell entry.<ref name=\"CD147\" />\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = SARS-CoV-2 49531042877.jpg | alt1 = SARS-CoV-2 emerging from a human cell | image2 = SARS-CoV-2 scanning electron microscope image.jpg | alt2 = SARS-CoV-2 virions emerging from a human cell | footer_align = center | footer = Digitally colourised [[Micrograph|electron micrographs]] of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells [[Cell culture|cultured]] in a laboratory}}\n\nInitial spike protein priming by [[TMPRSS2|transmembrane protease, serine 2]] (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" /> After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's [[protease]] TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a [[fusion peptide]].

The girl was found with her head crushed in from a large chunk of road pavement and a stick extruding from her vagina. Lee, argued on behalf of the illegal alien, along with Barack Obama to stay the convicted rapist/ murderers execution for international agreements of treaties, but were unsuccessful and the convicted rapist/murderer, illegal alien was put to death anyway. Lee claimed that the reason she was released from her imprisonment was because of the international agreement of consul being awarded to citizens of their home countries, which the convicted racist murderer was not provided while incarcerated. However, \nthis claim is unfounded as consul from his home country of Mexico, would have done the perpetrator no good as he had already confessed to the crime. Many critics of her (Lee) attempt to defend a convicted murderer/rapist have demanded to know why she felt as though her voice mattered at all, considering the 2 cases were completely different, and a stark contrast from what she did to recieve such a sentence, and what the rapist/murderer and illegal alien did. Many american patriots feel the family of the murdered girl are owed an apology, not just from Lee, but from Obama as well. Considering, the 16 year old girl, who had done nothing wrong and in her own country lost her life to a brutal attacker not legally allowed to be in the United States of America, whereas, Lee, was in the wrong place at the right time and got what she deserved. Ryan Simmons, an American patriot, and also a native of San Antonio Texas, where the 16 year old was from, stated that \"If the 2 had switched fates, then it would be a feel good story because both would have been given what they asked for and deserved, and it's just unfortunate that didn't happen.\" Meaning, the 16 year old girl should've been released upon request and Lee should've been brutally gang raped and murdered for her own self inflicted stupidity as an adult, regardless of her reasoning for being where she was at the time of her capture. \"There is not much else we needed to know about North Korea, and I highly doubt that 2 female journalists would be capable of proving otherwise. In fact, it doesn't come as any surprise that what happened, happened.\", \"It's just a shame that some people (Lee) feel the need to inject their unimportant suggestions or \"what-to-do's\" to find some form of notoriety at the expense of a true victim that did nothing to provoke their attack,that ended, ultimately,in their demise.\", \"The best news to come out of this is that we no longer need to know anything else about Euna Lee, because she's obviously not that bright, and nobody cares what she has to say anyway.\" Added Simmons. \n\nNo apology to date has been given to the family of the 16 year old victim by Lee, or Obama.\n\n==See also==\n* [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea]]\n* [[List of Americans detained by North Korea]]\n* [[Han Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://publication.samachar.com/pub_article.php?id=4949724 Euna Lee reunite with family]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160520230245/http://www.tving.com/vod/player/E000098701 Journalist Euna Lee]  at \ubc31\uc9c0\uc5f0\uc758 \ud53c\ud50cInside\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee, Euna}}\n[[Category:American people of Korean descent]]\n[[Category:American women of Korean descent]]\n[[Category:North Korea\u2013United States relations]]\n[[Category:People from Sacramento County, California]]\n[[Category:Prisoners and detainees of North Korea]]\n[[Category:South Korean journalists]]\n[[Category:Current TV people]]\n[[Category:American people imprisoned abroad]]\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Recipients of North Korean pardons]]\n[[Category:Academy of Art University alumni]]\n[[Category:Date of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:American women television journalists]]\n[[Category:Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni]]\n\n\n{{Korea-bio-stub}}\n{{US-tv-journalist-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name             = Euna Lee\n| image            = \n| caption          = \n| birthname        = \uc774\uc2b9\uc740 (Lee Seung-un)\n| birth_date       = {{birth year and age|1972}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr555/text |title=H.Res.555 \u2013 Expressing concern for the well-being of journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee and urging the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to release them on humanitarian grounds. |publisher=[[United States Congress]] |accessdate=5 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807063835/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr555/text |archivedate=7 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| birth_place      = [[South Korea]]\n| death_date       = \n| death_place      = \n| education        = \n| occupation       = Journalist\n| alias            = \n| title            = \n| family           = \n| spouse           = Michael Saldate\n| domestic_partner =\n| children         = Hana Saldate\n| relatives        = \n| nationality      = [[United States|American]]\n| salary           = \n| networth         = \n| credits          = [[Current TV]]\n| agent            = \n| URL              = \n}}\n\n'''Euna Lee''' ([[Hangul]]: \ub9ac\uc720\ub098) (born 1972) is a Korean American journalist who has worked for [[Current TV]] since 2005.<ref name=\"resume\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.act-edit.com/EunaLeeResume_20070805.htm |title=Euna Lee resume |publisher=[[Act-edit.com]] |accessdate=5 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408055417/http://www.act-edit.com/EunaLeeResume_20070805.htm |archivedate=8 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Lee and fellow journalist [[Laura Ling]] were [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea|detained in North Korea]] after they crossed into the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] from the People's Republic of China without a visa.
