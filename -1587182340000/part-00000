In 1970 the Faculty of Engineering opened branches of Mining, Technology and Metallurgy, initially in Mitrovica, school year 1970/71, to continue then in Pristina until the establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy in Mitrovica in 1974. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, at the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\" (UMIB) operate six faculties:<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UMIB|url=https://umib.net/en/history/|website=Umib.net|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy was of great importance for the whole of Kosovo. It was the Trep\u00e7a-Mineral-Metallurgical Combine that needed great engineering cadres from the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy. The frameworks from the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy and the High Technical School are well deserved in the Kosovo Power Combinations and the entire industry and economy of Kosovo.\n\nThe students who studied at the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy and the Technical High School were from all parts of Kosovo, considering that these branches were only studied in Mitrovica. A large number of students came from other Albanian areas, from Macedonia and Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja and Montenegro. Many foreign students were enrolled and graduated from this faculty, especially from the Middle East.\n\nBased on these faculties and based on the tradition of over 60 years of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on March 6, 2013, established the Public University of Mitrovica, while the Kosovo Assembly on 31 May 2013 has ratified the decision. According to the Provisional Statute, approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, within the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\" (UMIB) there are six faculties: Faculty of Geosciences (FGJT), Faculty of Food Technology (FTU), Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering (FIMK), Faculty of Law (FJ), Faculty of Economics (FE) and Faculty of Education (FE).\n\nWithin these faculties, there are a total of 23 study programs at bachelor and master level. A total of 69 teachers and assistants in regular working engagement are engaged in the teaching process. Of these, 53 are Doctor of Science and 15 are under a master or master's degree, according to the calls: 15 regular professors, 14 associate professors, 21 assistant professors, 4 lecturers, and 15 assistants.\n\n== The Mission and Vision ==\n\nThe UMIB is a higher education institution at the regional level of the municipality of Mitrovica. As such, the students' and academic staff' s (AS) research work will work in line with academic values, in achieving greater excellence and creativity in learning and research.

The University, as an educational and research institution, is convinced that the overall development of society can be achieved by human capacity building in all areas of life.\n\nIts mission is:\n\n* To act as a leading center for the advancement of knowledge, ideas, and science in Kosovo' s higher education system;\n* To play the leading role in the enhancement of education, science, culture, society and the economy of Kosovo;\n* To assist in the process of promoting civic democracy\n* To seek to create and support the highest standards in teaching and learning, scientific research and artistic work;\n* To utilize its resources in the most efficient way;\n* To fully cooperate and participate in all higher educational activities at the regional, national, and international levels;\n* To adjust European standards;\n* To fully integrate into the European Area of Higher Education (in line with the Bologna The declaration, the Lisbon Recognition Convention and the European Research Area) and to take the appropriate reform steps necessary to achieve this objective;\n* To create and transmit knowledge, and to develop and protect it through teaching, research, and innovation, as well as through other services in the fields of educational sciences.\n\n=== Vision ===\nThe University of Mitrovica aims to be one of the leading public institutions of higher education and scientific research in the Republic of Kosovo.  It is focused on quality development, the quality of teaching and research, as well as, on the active participation in debates; and to support the overall economic and social development in the Republic of Kosovo.\n\nBy 2021, UMIB aims to become an open, appealing higher education institution ''not only'' within the Republic of Kosovo ''but'' also ''beyond'' its boundaries; That is, it aims to become a regional, national, and international well-known higher education with clear goals for developing future professions, and continuous involvement of the academic staff in solving current social issues in the region, and beyond.\n\nWe define the vision and the desired effect as a broad idea of the UMIB in accordance with the existing legal framework. A broad-based concept of the UMIB (2018 \u2013 2021) is important and necessary for sustainable development, particularly in terms of achieving the defined goals.\n\nBased on scientific work and educational results, the UMIB is recognized as an important institution in the field of technical sciences. It is achieved through the education of engineers at all levels and various profiles in technical sciences.  In addition, social sciences are present in all spheres of everyday life and have an important place for building a brighter and more prosperous future for Kosovar citizens.\n\n== The organizational structure of UMIB ==\nRector's word: The University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\" (UMIB), with the 6 faculties and 23 programs it has, offers an extraordinary opportunity for young people who want to study and walk towards a developed world. The experience in the technical sciences makes this university transform Mitrovica into a science center of the young people in Kosovo. New social trends are an opportunity for students. While cooperation and exchanges with international universities have opened another path that can and should be used by students and teachers. Theoretical work combined with practical work makes UMIB a benchmark for young people who want to be competitive in the labor market. A qualified staff is a guarantee for a safe future.\n[[File:Alush_Musaj.jpg|thumb|The rector of the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\"]]\n[[File:UmibOrganigram.jpg|thumb|The organizational hierarchy of the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\"]]\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe founding of the University of Mitrovica was part of a wider Kosovo government initiative to facilitate access through higher education throughout Kosovo.

In 1970 the Faculty of Engineering opened branches of Mining, Technology and Metallurgy, initially in Mitrovica, school year 1970/71, to continue then in Pristina until the establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy in Mitrovica in 1974. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, at the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\" (UMIB) operate six faculties:<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UMIB|url=https://umib.net/en/history/|website=Umib.net|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy was of great importance for the whole of Kosovo. It was the Trep\u00e7a-Mineral-Metallurgical Combine that needed great engineering cadres from the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy. The frameworks from the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy and the High Technical School are well deserved in the Kosovo Power Combinations and the entire industry and economy of Kosovo.\n\nThe students who studied at the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy and the Technical High School were from all parts of Kosovo, considering that these branches were only studied in Mitrovica. A large number of students came from other Albanian areas, from Macedonia and Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja and Montenegro. Many foreign students were enrolled and graduated from this faculty, especially from the Middle East.\n\nBased on these faculties and based on the tradition of over 60 years of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on March 6, 2013, established the Public University of Mitrovica, while the Kosovo Assembly on 31 May 2013 has ratified the decision. According to the Provisional Statute, approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, within the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\" (UMIB) there are six faculties: Faculty of Geosciences (FGJT), Faculty of Food Technology (FTU), Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering (FIMK), Faculty of Law (FJ), Faculty of Economics (FE) and Faculty of Education (FE).\n\nWithin these faculties, there are a total of 23 study programs at bachelor and master level. A total of 69 teachers and assistants in regular working engagement are engaged in the teaching process. Of these, 53 are Doctor of Science and 15 are under a master or master's degree, according to the calls: 15 regular professors, 14 associate professors, 21 assistant professors, 4 lecturers, and 15 assistants.\n\n== The Mission and Vision ==\n\nThe UMIB is a higher education institution at the regional level of the municipality of Mitrovica.

In 1957, the Higher Institute of Medicine and other five Higher Institutes of Education formed the State University of Tirana. In that occasion was created the Faculty of Medicine, as the main referent institution for the Albanian Medicine. Due to the highest grade of expertise and professionalism, on January 23, 2013, the Faculty of Medicine was promoted with the status of University, founding the '''University of Medicine, Tirana''' (''Universiteti i Mjek\u00ebsis\u00eb, Tiran\u00eb''). UMT inherited the Faculty of Medicine and Technical Medical Sciences from the University of Tirana, and created hence the Faculty of Pharmacy, the Faculty of Dental Medicine and the Faculty of Public Health. The first rector of the University of Medicine, Tirana, was professor Jera Kruja.

In 1957, the Higher Institute of Medicine and other five Higher Institutes of Education formed the State University of Tirana. In that occasion was created the Faculty of Medicine, as the main referent institution for the Albanian Medicine. Due to the highest grade of expertise and professionalism, on January 23, 2013, the Faculty of Medicine was promoted with the status of University, founding the '''University of Medicine, Tirana''' (''Universiteti i Mjek\u00ebsis\u00eb, Tiran\u00eb''). UMT inherited the Faculty of Medicine and Technical Medical Sciences from the University of Tirana, and created hence the Faculty of Pharmacy, the Faculty of Dental Medicine and the Faculty of Public Health. The first rector of the University of Medicine, Tirana, was professor Jera Kruja. Since it re-organisation, on 30 March 2016, the University of Medicine, Tirana is composed of three Faculties: Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Technical Medical Sciences, Faculty of Dental Medicine.\n\n==Academics and Size==\nThe University of Medicine, Tirana is one of the most important [[universities]] in [[Albania]].
