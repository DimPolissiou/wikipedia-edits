[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (August 24, 2007 entry) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ (Retrieved February 17, 2010)</ref>\n\nMuch of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their [[social integration|integrity and coherence]] in [[modernity]], an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social [[institutions]] have come into being. His first major sociological work was ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology.<ref name=\"Allan_104\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=104}}</ref> In 1898, he established the journal ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a study of [[suicide]] rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]]. ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.\n\nDurkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate [[science]]. He refined the [[positivism]] originally set forth by [[Auguste Comte]], promoting what could be considered as a form of [[epistemological]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]], as well as the use of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] in social science. For him, sociology was the science of [[institution]]s, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity\"<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1982|p=45}}</ref> and its aim being to discover structural [[social fact]]s. Durkheim was a major proponent of [[structural functionalism]], a foundational perspective in both sociology and [[anthropology]]. In his view, social science should be purely [[holism|holistic]];<ref name=socialfacts>{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=\u00c9mile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895|page=14|quote=The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things.}}</ref> that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.\n\nHe remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[morality]], [[social stratification]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[Sociology of education|education]], and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]].

Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community.<ref name=\"Poggi_1\"/> Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. [[Marcel Mauss]], a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-107\"/> One of his nieces was Claudette (n\u00e9e Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of [[Maurice Bloch]], who became a noted anthropologist.\n\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'' (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=2}}</ref> The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and [[Henri Bergson]], would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin [[dissertation]] on [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].<ref>{{harvp|Bottomore|Nisbet|1978|p=8}}</ref> At the same time, he read [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no [[social science]] curriculum at the time. Durkheim found [[Humanities|humanistic studies]] uninteresting, turning his attention from [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] to [[ethics]] and, eventually, [[sociology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> He obtained his ''[[agr\u00e9gation]]'' in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=64}}</ref>\n\nThe opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA104 p. 104]}}</ref> In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of [[empiricism]] and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian method]].<ref>{{harvp|Jones|Spiro|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vM5MgiPPlgcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA148 p. 149]}}</ref> By 1886, as part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], he had completed the draft of his ''The Division of Labour in Society'', and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\n[[File:Emile Durkheim, Le Socialisme maitrier.jpg|thumb|A collection of Durkheim's courses on the origins of socialism (1896), edited and published by his nephew, [[Marcel Mauss]], in 1928]]\n\nDurkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His official title was ''Charg\u00e9 d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de P\u00e9dagogie'' and thus he taught both [[pedagogy]] and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before).<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=3}}</ref> The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> From this position Durkheim helped reform the [[French school system]], introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.\n\nAlso in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They would have two children, Marie and Andr\u00e9.<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/>\n\nThe 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> In 1893, he published ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and [[evolution of society|its development]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=x}}</ref> Durkheim's interest in [[social phenomena]] was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to the fall of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], which was then replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new [[secularism|secular]] and [[republicanism|republican]] rule, as many people considered a vigorously [[nationalistic]] approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA105 p. 105]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'',<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> a [[manifesto]] stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In 1898, he founded ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', the first French social science journal.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'', a [[case study]] that provided an example of what a sociological [[monograph]] might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of [[quantitative methods in criminology]], which he used in his study of suicide.\n\nBy 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the [[professorship|chair]] of education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in \"Education and Sociology\".<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Because [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]] are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence\u2014his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/> In 1912, he published his last major work, ''[[The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life]]''.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Tomba emile durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|\u00c9mile Durkheim's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery]]\nThe outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] was always patriotic rather than internationalist\u2014he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist [[propaganda]] that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]]. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, Andr\u00e9, died on the war front in December 1915\u2014a loss from which Durkheim never recovered.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_105\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=105}}</ref> Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a [[stroke]] in Paris on November 15, 1917.<ref name=\"Allan_105\"/> He was buried at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name=Pickering>{{harvp|Pickering|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUl5F0uLrkUC&pg=PA11&dq=%C3%89mile+Durkheim+Cimeti%C3%A8re+de+Montparnasse&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQuwUwAWoVChMIsdXQ0OzvxwIVgQ-SCh0SxwMj#v=onepage&q=%C3%89mile%20Durkheim%20Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Montparnasse&f=false p. 11]}}</ref>\n\n==Durkheim's thought==\nThroughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed.  To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and [[social integration]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_102\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=102}}</ref> Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:\n\n{{Quote|For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=136}}</ref>}}\n\n===Inspirations===\nDuring his university studies at the \u00c9cole, Durkheim was influenced by two [[neo-Kantian]] scholars, [[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] and [[\u00c9mile Boutroux]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included [[rationalism]], scientific study of morality, anti-[[utilitarianism]] and secular education.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His methodology was influenced by [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a supporter of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], who effectively sought to extend and apply the [[scientific method]] found in the [[natural science]]s to the [[social science]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as [[Inductive reasoning|induce]] general [[scientific law]]s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] abstractions and philosophical speculation.<ref>{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=151}}</ref> At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] outlook called social [[scientific realism|realism]]. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\">{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=152}}</ref> As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the [[subjectivity|individual's perception]] of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as [[empiricism]] and [[positivism]]. Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\"/> Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \"apparent\" laws, but would be able to discover the ''inherent nature'' of society.\n\nScholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of [[Secular Jewish culture|secularized Jewish thought]],<ref>{{harvp|Strenski|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nyneB7F0m0sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 1\u20132]}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Me\u0161trovi\u0107|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lqGUxDs3K_UC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 37]}}: \"While Durkheim did not become a Rabbi, he may have transformed his father's philosophical and moral concerns into something new, his version of sociology.\"</ref> while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.<ref>{{harvp|Pickering|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=amP-MyZAL-cC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 79]}}</ref>\n\n===Establishing sociology===\nDurkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> His concern was to establish sociology as a science.<ref>{{harvp|Popolo|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vMALg_p5zHsC&pg=PA97 pp. 97\u2013]}}</ref> Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences he wrote:\n{{quote|Sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.<ref>{{harvp|Brinton|Nee|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=71e_jsQpzg0C&pg=PR11 pp. 11\u2013]}}</ref>}}\n\nTo give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own [[methodology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He argued, \"There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from ....those studied by the other natural sciences.\"<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\">{{harvp|Durkheim|2007|pp=101\u2013102, 95\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural \"[[social fact]]s\".<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"socialfact\">Durkheim, \u00c9mile [1895] \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" 8th edition, trans.

One of the questions raised concerns the [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, [[observation]] must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a \"perfectly objective observation\" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its [[Social relation|relation]] with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege [[Comparative method|comparison]] rather than the study of singular independent facts.<ref>{{harvp|Collins|1975|p=539}}: \"Durkheim was the first to seriously use the comparative method correctly in the scientific sense\".</ref>\n\nDurkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with [[Herbert Spencer]], he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society \"work\"). He also agreed with Spencer's [[organicism|organic analogy]], comparing society to a living organism.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960a}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960b}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Thompson|2002}}</ref> Durkheim also insisted that society was [[Holism|more than the sum of its parts]].<ref>\"Science cannot describe individuals, but only types.

He believed that crime is \"bound up with the fundamental conditions of all [[social relation|social life]]\" and serves a social function.<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> He stated that crime implies \"not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> Examining the [[trial of Socrates]], he argues that \"his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country\" as \"it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> As such, his crime \"was a useful prelude to reforms\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that \"the authority which the moral [[conscience]] enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/>\n\n====Suicide====\n{{main|Suicide (Durkheim book)}}\nIn ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated [[suicide]] as a [[social fact]], explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one's circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that they have not made a difference in anyone's lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to a belief that there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.\n\nThis study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],<ref>{{harvp|Stark|Bainbridge|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&pg=PA32 p. 32]}}</ref> who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant\u2013Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may have always been the [[Spurious relationship|spurious reflection]] of other factors.<ref>{{harvp|Pope|Danigelis|1981}}</ref> Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the [[Fallacy|logical error]] termed the [[ecological fallacy]].<ref>Freedman, David A. 2002. ''The Ecological Fallacy''. University of California. [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/ecofall.txt]</ref><ref>{{harvp|Selvin|1965}}</ref> However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy.<ref>{{harvp|van Poppel|Day|1996|p=500}}</ref> More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the [[Structure and agency|micro\u2013macro relations]] underlying Durkheim's work.<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Some, such as Inkeles (1959),<ref>{{harvp|Inkeles|1959}}</ref> Johnson (1965)<ref>{{harvp|Johnson|1965}}</ref> and Gibbs (1968),<ref>{{harvp|Gibbs|Martin|1958}}</ref> have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide ''sociologically'' within a [[holism|holistic]] perspective, emphasizing that \"he intended his theory to explain variation among [[social environment]]s in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals\".<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|p=60}}</ref>\n\nDespite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of [[Control theory (sociology)|control theory]], and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of [[spirituality]] and [[God]].<ref name=\"Allan_112\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim defined religion as\n\n{{quote|A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden\u2014beliefs and practices which unite in one single [[moral community]] called a [[Church body|Church]], all those who adhere to them.|\u00c9mile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', Book 1, Ch. 1<ref name=\"Allan_115\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=115}}</ref>}}\n\nIn this definition, Durkheim avoids references to [[supernatural]] or God.<ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural\u2014that which cannot be rationally explained\u2014from natural, that which can.<ref name=\"Allan_116\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=116}}</ref> Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as [[Buddhism]], where the [[Four Noble Truths]] are much more important than any individual deity.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the [[sacred]] (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the [[belief]]s and [[ritual|practices]] (which create highly emotional state\u2014[[collective effervescence]]\u2014and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the [[moral community]] (a group of people sharing a common [[moral philosophy]]).<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=116, 118, 120, 137}}</ref> Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> He defined sacred things as:\n\n{{quote|...simply collective ideals that have fixed themselves on material objects... they are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim saw religion as the most fundamental [[social institution]] of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/> It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=\"Allan_114\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=114}}</ref> Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early [[hunter and gatherer]] societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> However, Durkheim also believed that [[religion]] was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by [[science]] and the cult of an individual.<ref name=\"Allan_132-133\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/>\n\n{{quote|Thus there is something eternal in religion that is destined to outlive the succession of particular symbols in which religious thought has clothed itself.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>}}\n\nHowever, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as \"a period of transition and moral mediocrity\".<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>\n\nDurkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/> It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing [[category of being|categories]] as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|McKinnon|2014}}</ref> Our understanding of the world is shaped by [[social facts]]; for example the notion of [[time]] is defined by being measured through a [[calendar]], which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim states that, \"Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/>\n\nIn his work, Durkheim focused on [[totemism]], the religion of the [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/>\n\n{{Quote|text=Now the totem is the flag of the clan.

(1964). ''The elementary forms of the religious life.'' London: Allen & Unwin.</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, [[Arnold van Gennep]], an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were \"entirely erroneous\". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.<ref>{{harvp|Thomassen|2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, \"have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization\".<ref>http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/forms.html#pgfId=5658; section 7 \"Critical Remarks.\"</ref>\n\n===Sociology and philosophy===\n\n====Sociology of knowledge====\n\nWhile Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, [[social structure]]s, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.\n\nWhile publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 ''magnum opus'' ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.<ref>Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e \u00e9dition, 2003 {{p.|628}}</ref> In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.<ref>Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, {{p.|14-17}}, and {{p.|19-22}}.</ref>\n\nAnother key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' ([[collective representations]]), which is outlined in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. ''Repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).<ref name=\"Durkheim, Emile 1964\"/>\n\nArguably the most important \"repr\u00e9sentation collective\" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'repr\u00e9sentations collectives', and language in particular:\n<blockquote>add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.<ref>Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, \"Elementary Forms of Religious Life\" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].\n\n====Morality====\n\nDurkheim defines morality as \"a system of rules for conduct\".<ref>Durkheim, \u00c9mile. Sociologie et Philosophie. PUF. Paris, 2004. {{p.|50}}.</ref> His analysis of morality is strongly marked by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.\n\nDurkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, \"a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character\".<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=38}}</ref> Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the [[categorical imperative]]. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common [[Summum bonum|Good]], and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=54}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Deviance====\n{{Quote frame |quote=How many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! |author=\u00c9mile Durkheim |title=''[[The Division of Labour in Society#DivisionofLabourinSociety|''Division of Labour in Society'']]'' |source=<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=T.

First, Durkheim thought that deviance could challenge the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society.<ref name=\"Textbook\" /> Secondly, deviant acts could also support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors.<ref name=\"Textbook\"/> Finally, Durkheim believed that reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity.<ref name=\"UMN Textbook\">{{cite book|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/7-2-explaining-deviance/|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World; Explaining Deviance|publisher=University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing|isbn=978-1-946135-24-7|edition=2016|location=Section 7.2|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> Durkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to [[Strain theory (sociology)#Merton'sTheory|Robert Merton's Strain Theory]] <ref name=\"Textbook\"/>\n\n==Influences and legacy==\n\nDurkheim had an important impact on the development of Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as [[Marcel Mauss]], but also later thinkers, such as [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], and [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as [[Steven Lukes]], Robert N. Bellah, and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of [[Ziya G\u00f6kalp]], the founding father of Turkish sociology.<ref name=\"Turkay Salim Nefes\">{{harvp|Nefes|2013}}</ref> [[Randall Collins]] has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with [[Erving Goffman]]'s micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the [[interaction order]].\n\nOutside of sociology, he influenced philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and his ideas can be found latently in the work of certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Michel Foucault]].<ref>{{harvp|Bourdieu|Passeron|1967|pp=167\u2013168}}: \"For, speaking more generally, all the social sciences now live in the house of Durkheimism, unbeknownst to them, as it were, because they walked into it backwards.\"</ref>\n\n===Durkheim contra Searle===\nMuch of Durkheim's work, however, remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof one can look to [[John Searle]], who wrote a book ''The Construction of Social Reality'', in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. [[Neil Gross]] however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.<ref>{{harvp|Gross|2006}}</ref> Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, \"Because Durkheim\u2019s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\"<ref>{{harvp|Searle|2006}}</ref> Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Gilbert pro Durkheim===\nA contemporary philosopher of social phenomena who has offered a sympathetic close reading of Durkheim's discussion of social facts in chapter 1 and the prefaces of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' is [[Margaret Gilbert]]. In chapter 4, section 2, of her 1989 book ''On Social Facts'' (whose title may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his \"faits sociaux\") Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Montesquieu's contributions to the formation of social science'' (1892)\n* ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895)\n* ''On the Normality of Crime'' (1895)\n* ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897)\n* ''The Prohibition of Incest and its Origins'' (1897), published in ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;1\u201370\n* ''Sociology and its Scientific Domain'' (1900), translation of an Italian text entitled \"La sociologia e il suo dominio scientifico\"\n* ''Primitive Classification'' (1903), in collaboration with [[Marcel Mauss]]\n* ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912)\n* ''Who Wanted War?''

[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (August 24, 2007 entry) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ (Retrieved February 17, 2010)</ref>\n\nMuch of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their [[social integration|integrity and coherence]] in [[modernity]], an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social [[institutions]] have come into being. His first major sociological work was ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology.<ref name=\"Allan_104\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=104}}</ref> In 1898, he established the journal ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a study of [[suicide]] rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]]. ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.\n\nDurkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate [[science]]. He refined the [[positivism]] originally set forth by [[Auguste Comte]], promoting what could be considered as a form of [[epistemological]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]], as well as the use of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] in social science. For him, sociology was the science of [[institution]]s, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity\"<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1982|p=45}}</ref> and its aim being to discover structural [[social fact]]s. Durkheim was a major proponent of [[structural functionalism]], a foundational perspective in both sociology and [[anthropology]]. In his view, social science should be purely [[holism|holistic]];<ref name=socialfacts>{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=\u00c9mile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895|page=14|quote=The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things.}}</ref> that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.\n\nHe remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[morality]], [[social stratification]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[Sociology of education|education]], and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]].

Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community.<ref name=\"Poggi_1\"/> Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. [[Marcel Mauss]], a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-107\"/> One of his nieces was Claudette (n\u00e9e Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of [[Maurice Bloch]], who became a noted anthropologist.\n\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'' (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=2}}</ref> The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and [[Henri Bergson]], would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin [[dissertation]] on [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].<ref>{{harvp|Bottomore|Nisbet|1978|p=8}}</ref> At the same time, he read [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no [[social science]] curriculum at the time. Durkheim found [[Humanities|humanistic studies]] uninteresting, turning his attention from [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] to [[ethics]] and, eventually, [[sociology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> He obtained his ''[[agr\u00e9gation]]'' in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=64}}</ref>\n\nThe opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA104 p. 104]}}</ref> In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of [[empiricism]] and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian method]].<ref>{{harvp|Jones|Spiro|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vM5MgiPPlgcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA148 p. 149]}}</ref> By 1886, as part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], he had completed the draft of his ''The Division of Labour in Society'', and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\n[[File:Emile Durkheim, Le Socialisme maitrier.jpg|thumb|A collection of Durkheim's courses on the origins of socialism (1896), edited and published by his nephew, [[Marcel Mauss]], in 1928]]\n\nDurkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His official title was ''Charg\u00e9 d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de P\u00e9dagogie'' and thus he taught both [[pedagogy]] and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before).<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=3}}</ref> The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> From this position Durkheim helped reform the [[French school system]], introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.\n\nAlso in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They would have two children, Marie and Andr\u00e9.<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/>\n\nThe 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> In 1893, he published ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and [[evolution of society|its development]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=x}}</ref> Durkheim's interest in [[social phenomena]] was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to the fall of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], which was then replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new [[secularism|secular]] and [[republicanism|republican]] rule, as many people considered a vigorously [[nationalistic]] approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA105 p. 105]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'',<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> a [[manifesto]] stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In 1898, he founded ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', the first French social science journal.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'', a [[case study]] that provided an example of what a sociological [[monograph]] might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of [[quantitative methods in criminology]], which he used in his study of suicide.\n\nBy 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the [[professorship|chair]] of education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in \"Education and Sociology\".<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Because [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]] are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence\u2014his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/> In 1912, he published his last major work, ''[[The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life]]''.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Tomba emile durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|\u00c9mile Durkheim's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery]]\nThe outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] was always patriotic rather than internationalist\u2014he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist [[propaganda]] that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]]. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, Andr\u00e9, died on the war front in December 1915\u2014a loss from which Durkheim never recovered.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_105\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=105}}</ref> Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a [[stroke]] in Paris on November 15, 1917.<ref name=\"Allan_105\"/> He was buried at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name=Pickering>{{harvp|Pickering|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUl5F0uLrkUC&pg=PA11&dq=%C3%89mile+Durkheim+Cimeti%C3%A8re+de+Montparnasse&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQuwUwAWoVChMIsdXQ0OzvxwIVgQ-SCh0SxwMj#v=onepage&q=%C3%89mile%20Durkheim%20Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Montparnasse&f=false p. 11]}}</ref>\n\n==Durkheim's thought==\nThroughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed.  To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and [[social integration]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_102\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=102}}</ref> Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:\n\n{{Quote|For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=136}}</ref>}}\n\n===Inspirations===\nDuring his university studies at the \u00c9cole, Durkheim was influenced by two [[neo-Kantian]] scholars, [[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] and [[\u00c9mile Boutroux]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included [[rationalism]], scientific study of morality, anti-[[utilitarianism]] and secular education.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His methodology was influenced by [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a supporter of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], who effectively sought to extend and apply the [[scientific method]] found in the [[natural science]]s to the [[social science]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as [[Inductive reasoning|induce]] general [[scientific law]]s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] abstractions and philosophical speculation.<ref>{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=151}}</ref> At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] outlook called social [[scientific realism|realism]]. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\">{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=152}}</ref> As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the [[subjectivity|individual's perception]] of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as [[empiricism]] and [[positivism]]. Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\"/> Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \"apparent\" laws, but would be able to discover the ''inherent nature'' of society.\n\nScholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work.

One of the questions raised concerns the [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, [[observation]] must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a \"perfectly objective observation\" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its [[Social relation|relation]] with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege [[Comparative method|comparison]] rather than the study of singular independent facts.<ref>{{harvp|Collins|1975|p=539}}: \"Durkheim was the first to seriously use the comparative method correctly in the scientific sense\".</ref>\n\nDurkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with [[Herbert Spencer]], he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society \"work\"). He also agreed with Spencer's [[organicism|organic analogy]], comparing society to a living organism.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960a}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960b}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Thompson|2002}}</ref> Durkheim also insisted that society was [[Holism|more than the sum of its parts]].<ref>\"Science cannot describe individuals, but only types.

He believed that crime is \"bound up with the fundamental conditions of all [[social relation|social life]]\" and serves a social function.<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> He stated that crime implies \"not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> Examining the [[trial of Socrates]], he argues that \"his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country\" as \"it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> As such, his crime \"was a useful prelude to reforms\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that \"the authority which the moral [[conscience]] enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/>\n\n====Suicide====\n{{main|Suicide (Durkheim book)}}\nIn ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated [[suicide]] as a [[social fact]], explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one's circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that they have not made a difference in anyone's lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to a belief that there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.\n\nThis study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],<ref>{{harvp|Stark|Bainbridge|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&pg=PA32 p. 32]}}</ref> who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant\u2013Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may have always been the [[Spurious relationship|spurious reflection]] of other factors.<ref>{{harvp|Pope|Danigelis|1981}}</ref> Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the [[Fallacy|logical error]] termed the [[ecological fallacy]].<ref>Freedman, David A. 2002. ''The Ecological Fallacy''. University of California. [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/ecofall.txt]</ref><ref>{{harvp|Selvin|1965}}</ref> However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy.<ref>{{harvp|van Poppel|Day|1996|p=500}}</ref> More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the [[Structure and agency|micro\u2013macro relations]] underlying Durkheim's work.<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Some, such as Inkeles (1959),<ref>{{harvp|Inkeles|1959}}</ref> Johnson (1965)<ref>{{harvp|Johnson|1965}}</ref> and Gibbs (1968),<ref>{{harvp|Gibbs|Martin|1958}}</ref> have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide ''sociologically'' within a [[holism|holistic]] perspective, emphasizing that \"he intended his theory to explain variation among [[social environment]]s in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals\".<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|p=60}}</ref>\n\nDespite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of [[Control theory (sociology)|control theory]], and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of [[spirituality]] and [[God]].<ref name=\"Allan_112\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim defined religion as\n\n{{quote|A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden\u2014beliefs and practices which unite in one single [[moral community]] called a [[Church body|Church]], all those who adhere to them.|\u00c9mile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', Book 1, Ch. 1<ref name=\"Allan_115\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=115}}</ref>}}\n\nIn this definition, Durkheim avoids references to [[supernatural]] or God.<ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural\u2014that which cannot be rationally explained\u2014from natural, that which can.<ref name=\"Allan_116\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=116}}</ref> Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as [[Buddhism]], where the [[Four Noble Truths]] are much more important than any individual deity.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the [[sacred]] (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the [[belief]]s and [[ritual|practices]] (which create highly emotional state\u2014[[collective effervescence]]\u2014and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the [[moral community]] (a group of people sharing a common [[moral philosophy]]).<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=116, 118, 120, 137}}</ref> Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> He defined sacred things as:\n\n{{quote|...simply collective ideals that have fixed themselves on material objects... they are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim saw religion as the most fundamental [[social institution]] of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/> It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=\"Allan_114\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=114}}</ref> Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early [[hunter and gatherer]] societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> However, Durkheim also believed that [[religion]] was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by [[science]] and the cult of an individual.<ref name=\"Allan_132-133\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/>\n\n{{quote|Thus there is something eternal in religion that is destined to outlive the succession of particular symbols in which religious thought has clothed itself.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>}}\n\nHowever, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as \"a period of transition and moral mediocrity\".<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>\n\nDurkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/> It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing [[category of being|categories]] as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|McKinnon|2014}}</ref> Our understanding of the world is shaped by [[social facts]]; for example the notion of [[time]] is defined by being measured through a [[calendar]], which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim states that, \"Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/>\n\nIn his work, Durkheim focused on [[totemism]], the religion of the [[Australian Aborigines|aboriginal]] Australians and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/>\n\n{{Quote|text=Now the totem is the flag of the clan.

The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, [[Arnold van Gennep]], an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were \"entirely erroneous\". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.<ref>{{harvp|Thomassen|2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, \"have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization\".<ref>http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/forms.html#pgfId=5658; section 7 \"Critical Remarks.\"</ref>\n\n===Sociology and philosophy===\n\n====Sociology of knowledge====\n\nWhile Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, [[social structure]]s, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.\n\nWhile publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 ''magnum opus'' ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.<ref>Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e \u00e9dition, 2003 {{p.|628}}</ref> In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.<ref>Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, {{p.|14-17}}, and {{p.|19-22}}.</ref>\n\nAnother key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' ([[collective representations]]), which is outlined in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. ''Repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).<ref name=\"Durkheim, Emile 1964\"/>\n\nArguably the most important \"repr\u00e9sentation collective\" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'repr\u00e9sentations collectives', and language in particular:\n<blockquote>add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.<ref>Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, \"Elementary Forms of Religious Life\" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].\n\n====Morality====\n\nDurkheim defines morality as \"a system of rules for conduct\".<ref>Durkheim, \u00c9mile. Sociologie et Philosophie. PUF. Paris, 2004. {{p.|50}}.</ref> His analysis of morality is strongly marked by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.\n\nDurkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, \"a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character\".<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=38}}</ref> Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the [[categorical imperative]]. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common [[Summum bonum|Good]], and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=54}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Deviance====\n{{Quote frame |quote=How many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! |author=\u00c9mile Durkheim |title=''[[The Division of Labour in Society#DivisionofLabourinSociety|''Division of Labour in Society'']]'' |source=<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=T.

First, Durkheim thought that deviance could challenge the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society.<ref name=\"Textbook\" /> Secondly, deviant acts could also support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors.<ref name=\"Textbook\"/> Finally, Durkheim believed that reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity.<ref name=\"UMN Textbook\">{{cite book|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/7-2-explaining-deviance/|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World; Explaining Deviance|publisher=University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing|isbn=978-1-946135-24-7|edition=2016|location=Section 7.2|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> Durkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to [[Strain theory (sociology)#Merton'sTheory|Robert Merton's Strain Theory]] <ref name=\"Textbook\"/>\n\n==Influences and legacy==\n\nDurkheim had an important impact on the development of Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as [[Marcel Mauss]], but also later thinkers, such as [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], and [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as [[Steven Lukes]], Robert N. Bellah, and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of [[Ziya G\u00f6kalp]], the founding father of Turkish sociology.<ref name=\"Turkay Salim Nefes\">{{harvp|Nefes|2013}}</ref> [[Randall Collins]] has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with [[Erving Goffman]]'s micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the [[interaction order]].\n\nOutside of sociology, he influenced philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and his ideas can be found latently in the work of certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Michel Foucault]].<ref>{{harvp|Bourdieu|Passeron|1967|pp=167\u2013168}}: \"For, speaking more generally, all the social sciences now live in the house of Durkheimism, unbeknownst to them, as it were, because they walked into it backwards.\"</ref>\n\n===Durkheim contra Searle===\nMuch of Durkheim's work, however, remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof one can look to [[John Searle]], who wrote a book ''The Construction of Social Reality'', in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. [[Neil Gross]] however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.<ref>{{harvp|Gross|2006}}</ref> Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, \"Because Durkheim\u2019s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\"<ref>{{harvp|Searle|2006}}</ref> Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Gilbert pro Durkheim===\nA contemporary philosopher of social phenomena who has offered a sympathetic close reading of Durkheim's discussion of social facts in chapter 1 and the prefaces of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' is [[Margaret Gilbert]]. In chapter 4, section 2, of her 1989 book ''On Social Facts'' (whose title may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his \"faits sociaux\") Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Montesquieu's contributions to the formation of social science'' (1892)\n* ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895)\n* ''On the Normality of Crime'' (1895)\n* ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897)\n* ''The Prohibition of Incest and its Origins'' (1897), published in ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;1\u201370\n* ''Sociology and its Scientific Domain'' (1900), translation of an Italian text entitled \"La sociologia e il suo dominio scientifico\"\n* ''Primitive Classification'' (1903), in collaboration with [[Marcel Mauss]]\n* ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912)\n* ''Who Wanted War?''

Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a stone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter.

This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.\n\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.\nIn [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.\n\n===Symbolism and related customs===\nSome Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170383/When-is-Easter-2016-What-are-the-dates-for-Good-Friday-Easter-Sunday-and-Easter-Monday.html|title=When is Easter 2016?

The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.<ref name=Meaning/><ref name=\"Symbolism\"/>\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[\u015bwi\u0119conka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.\n\nDuring [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).\n\nIn [[Greece]], women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of [[Communion rite|Communion]]). These ceremonial eggs are known as kokkina avga.

This also happens in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], Macedonia, [[Romania]], Russia, Serbia and Ukraine. In Easter Sunday friends and family hit each other's egg with their own. The one whose egg does not break is believed to be in for good luck in the future.\n\nIn Germany, eggs decorate trees and bushes as [[Easter egg tree]]s, and in several areas public wells as [[Osterbrunnen]].\n\nThere used to be a custom in [[Ukraine]], during Easter celebrations to have ''[[krashanky]]'' on a table in a bowl with wheatgrass.

They may also be put in a [[basket]] filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a [[bird nest|bird's nest]].\n\n==Tradition, Old Customs and Relations back to the past.==\n{{Main|Egg decorating||Pisanica (Croatian)|Pysanka|\u015awi\u0119conka}}\n[[File:Uskr\u0161nja ko\u0161arica2.jpg|thumb|Croatian [[Easter basket]]]]\n[[File:\u015awi\u0119cone2007.jpg|thumb|left|Blessing of Easter foods in [[Poland]]]]\n[[File:Pasxalina abga.jpg|thumb|Red coloured Easter eggs]]\n\n===Lenten tradition===\nThe Easter egg tradition may also have merged into the celebration of the end of the privations of [[Lent]] in the West.\nHistorically, it was traditional to use up all of the household's eggs before Lent began.\nEggs were originally forbidden during [[Lent]] as well as on other traditional [[fasting|fast]] days in [[Western Christianity]] (this tradition still continues among the [[Eastern Christian Churches]]).\nLikewise, in [[Eastern Christianity]], meat, eggs, and [[dairy]] are all prohibited during the [[Great Lent|Lenten fast]].\n\nThis established the tradition of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] being celebrated on [[Shrove Tuesday]].\n\nThis day, the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]] when Lent begins, is also known as [[Mardi Gras]], a French phrase which translates as \"Fat Tuesday\" to mark the last consumption of eggs and dairy before Lent begins.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, [[Great Lent]] begins on [[Clean Monday]], rather than Wednesday, so the household's dairy products would be used up in the preceding week, called [[Cheesefare Week]].\n\nDuring Lent, since chickens would not stop producing eggs during this time, a larger than usual store might be available at the end of the fast. This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.\n\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.\nIn [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.\n\n===Symbolism and related customs===\nSome Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170383/When-is-Easter-2016-What-are-the-dates-for-Good-Friday-Easter-Sunday-and-Easter-Monday.html|title=When is Easter 2016?

The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.<ref name=Meaning/><ref name=\"Symbolism\"/>\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[\u015bwi\u0119conka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.\n\nDuring [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).\n\nIn [[Greece]], women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of [[Communion rite|Communion]]). These ceremonial eggs are known as kokkina avga. They also bake [[tsoureki]] for the Easter Sunday feast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominiquesvillas.co.uk/en/blog/index.cfm/kalo-paska-happy-easter|title=Kalo Paska - Happy Easter|first=Natalie|last=Wagstaff|publisher=}}</ref> Red Easter eggs are sometimes served along the centerline of tsoureki (braided loaf of bread).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/food/index.ssf/2014/04/todays_easterpassover_recipe_f_1.html|title=Today's Recipe from Our Files: Greek Easter bread, Tsoueki|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Red and Butter, Martha Stewart magazine</ref>\n\nIn [[Egypt]], it is a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during [[Sham el-Nessim]] holiday, which falls every year after the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[Easter]].\n\nCoincidentally, every Passover, Jews place a hard-boiled egg on the Passover ceremonial plate, and the celebrants also eat hard-boiled eggs dipped in salt water as part of the ceremony.\n\n===Colouring===\n[[File:Ostereier - Easter eggs.jpg|thumb|Colors for the Easter eggs]]\n[[File:Urz\u0105dzenie podgrzewaj\u0105ce kolorowy wosk do malowania pisanek - detal.jpg|thumb|Heated wax paint used to decorate traditional Easter Eggs in the Czech Republic]]\nThe dyeing of Easter eggs in different colours is commonplace, with colour being achieved through boiling the egg in natural substances (such as, [[onion]] peel (brown colour), [[oak]] or [[alder]] bark or [[walnut]] nutshell (black), [[beet]] juice (pink) etc.), or using [[artificial colouring]]s.\n\nA greater variety of colour was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen [[yarn]]. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English ''pasche''. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping ([[egg tapping]]) competition.\n\nIn the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the [[blood of Christ]], with further symbolism being found in the hard shell of the egg symbolizing the sealed [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]] \u2014 the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead.

The word comes from the verb ''pysaty'', \"to write\", as the designs are not painted on, but written with [[beeswax]].\n\nDecorating eggs for Easter using wax resistant batik is a popular method in some other eastern European countries.\n\n=== Use of Easter eggs in decorations ===\nIn some [[Mediterranean]] countries, especially in [[Lebanon]], chicken eggs are boiled and decorated by dye and/or painting and used as decoration around the house. Then, on [[Easter Day]], young kids would duel with them saying 'Christ is resurrected, Indeed, He is', breaking and eating them. This also happens in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], Macedonia, [[Romania]], Russia, Serbia and Ukraine. In Easter Sunday friends and family hit each other's egg with their own. The one whose egg does not break is believed to be in for good luck in the future.\n\nIn Germany, eggs decorate trees and bushes as [[Easter egg tree]]s, and in several areas public wells as [[Osterbrunnen]].\n\nThere used to be a custom in [[Ukraine]], during Easter celebrations to have ''[[krashanky]]'' on a table in a bowl with wheatgrass.

The Church adopted the custom, and regarded the eggs as the emblem of the resurrection, as is evinced by the benediction of Pope Paul V., about 1610, which reads thus: \"Bless, O Lord! we beseech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants, eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of the Lord.\" Thus the custom has come down from ages lost in antiquity.)|year=1881|accessdate =7 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Itihaas>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CRvzTM0kev4C&pg=PA96&dq=In+many+countries+the+name+of+the+Christian+feast+we+call+Easter&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7ruAT-WLE6jo0QH6tdSLCA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=In%20many%20countries%20the%20name%20of%20the%20Christian%20feast%20we%20call%20Easter&f=false|title= Welcome to the Church Year: An Introduction to the Seasons of the Episcopal Church|author=Vicki K. Black|publisher= Church Publishing, Inc.|quote=The Christians of this region in Mesopotamia were probably the first to connect the decorating of eggs with the feast of the resurrection of Christ, and by the Middle Ages this practice was so widespread that in some places Easter Day was called Egg Sunday. In parts of Europe, the eggs were dyed red and were then cracked together when people exchanged Easter greetings. Many congregations today continue to have Easter egg hunts for the children after services on Easter Day.|date= 1 Jul 2004}}</ref>\nIn Greece, superstitions of the past included the custom of placing the first-dyed red egg at the home's [[iconostasis]] (place where icons are displayed) to ward off evil. The heads and backs of small lambs were also marked with the red dye to protect them.\n\n===Parallels in other faiths===\n[[File:Noruz1387.jpg|thumb|upright|Eggs at the Iranian [[Nowruz]]]]\n\nThe egg is widely used as a symbol of the start of new life, just as new life emerges from an egg when the chick hatches out.<ref name=\"fertility\" />\n\nPainted eggs are used at the Iranian spring holidays, the [[Nowruz]] that marks the first day of [[Spring (season)|spring]] or [[Equinox]], and the beginning of the year in the [[Persian calendar]]. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical [[Northward equinox]], which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. The painted eggs symbolize fertility and are displayed on the Nowruz table, called [[Haft-Seen]] together with various other symbolic objects. There are sometimes one egg for each member of the family. The ancient [[Zoroastrians]] painted eggs for Nowruz, their New Year celebration, which falls on the [[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring equinox]]. The tradition continues among Persians of [[Islam]]ic, [[Zoroastrian]], and other faiths today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theotheriran.com/2016/03/26/photos-painted-eggs-across-tehran/|title=Photos: Painted eggs across Tehran|date=2016-03-26|work=The other Iran|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}</ref> The Nowruz tradition has existed for at least 2,500 years.

While it is often claimed that the use of painted eggs is an ancient, pre-Christian component of the celebration of Ostara, there are no historical accounts that ancient celebrations included this practice, apart from the [[Old High German lullaby]] which is believed by most to be a modern fabrication. Rather, the use of painted eggs has been adopted under the assumption that it might be a pre-Christian survival. In fact, modern scholarship has been unable to trace any association between eggs and a supposed goddess named Ostara before the 19th century, when early folklorists began to speculate about the possibility.<ref name=Winick2016>Winick, Stephen.

The children's game of hunting for the [[afikomen]] (a half-piece of matzo) has similarities to the Easter egg hunt tradition, by which the child who finds the hidden bread will be awarded a prize. In other homes, the children hide the afikoman and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize for revealing its location.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Washi Egg Japan US 2.png|thumb|[[Washi eggs|Washi Egg]] ]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Balut (egg)|Balut]]\n*[[Century egg]]\n*[[Chinese red eggs]]\n*[[Cascar\u00f3n]]\n*[[Easter Bilby]]\n*[[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n*[[Festum Ovorum]]\n*[[Kinder Surprise]]\n*[[List of egg dishes]]\n*[[List of foods with religious symbolism]]\n*[[Resurrection of Jesus]]\n*[[Salted duck egg]]\n*[[Sham El Nessim]]\n*[[Smoked egg]]\n*[[Tea egg]]\n*[[Vegreville egg]]\n*[[Washi eggs]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Easter eggs}}\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Eggs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Easter Egg}}\n[[Category:Easter food|Egg]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions|Egg]]\n[[Category:Eggs (food)]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Christianity and religious syncretism]]\n", "name_user": "220.239.103.147", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg"}

Edwin Bonner, a merchant from [[Walla Walla, Washington]], established a ferry in 1864 where the trail crossed the broad [[Kootenai River]]. In 1875, Richard Fry, and his [[Sinixt]] wife, Justine Su-steel Fry, leased the business,<ref>Pryce, Paula. ''Keeping the Lakes Way'', {{ISBN|0-8020-8223-8}}, University of Toronto Press, pp. 166\u20137</ref> but the location retained the name of the original founder and later became the town of Bonners Ferry.\n\nBefore the [[gold rush]], only a few visitors had come to the region; one of the first was explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], a [[cartographer]] for the [[North West Company]]. Thompson and four fellow [[fur trader]]s arrived in 1808 to trade with the Lower Kootenais. The local natives gave Thompson's party dried fish and moss bread.  Thompson returned the next year and established a trading post on [[Lake Pend Oreille]]. He was followed in 1846 by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Priest [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|Father DeSmet]], a missionary to the [[Kootenai Tribe]].<ref name=\"DTSPM\">{{cite web |last1=Nisbet |first1=Jack |title=A place to build a House on |url=http://www.sandpointonline.com/sandpointmag/sms09/david_thompson.html |website=Sandpoint Magazine |publisher=Keokee Co.

Scattered along the valley and benchland were a few ranches and homesteads. Numerous mines were developed in the nearby mountains, including the Continental Mine in the Selkirks. The lumber industry also grew rapidly. Bonners Ferry, perched on stilts to avoid the inevitable spring floods, appeared to be a boom town.\n\nMoving into the 20th century, the town became the center of a lumbering and farming community. The valley land was drained, levees were constructed and farms were cleared on the benches. The rich Kootenai Valley became known as the \"Nile of the North,\" while the Bonners Ferry Lumber Company grew to be one of the world's largest [[lumber mill]]s. The downtown took shape as brick buildings were constructed, replacing those on stilts. Completion of the [[Libby Dam]] in 1975 lessened the threat of serious flooding. Today, much of Main Street dates from this initial period of solid, permanent construction.\n\nOn September 20, 1974, the [[Kootenai Tribe]], headed by chairwoman [[Amy Trice]], declared war on the United States government. Their first act was to post soldiers on each end of the highway that runs through the town who would ask people to pay a toll to drive through what had been the tribe's aboriginal land. The money would be used to house and care for elderly tribal members. Most tribes in the United States are forbidden to declare war on the U.S. government because of treaties, but the Kootenai Tribe never signed a treaty. The dispute resulted in the concession by the United States government and a land grant of {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} that is now the [[Kootenai Reservation]].<ref name=lewiston2June1976>{{cite news|last=Kuglin|first=John|title=Idaho Indians Reap Spoils Of War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u8ReAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1zEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3257,433563|accessdate=April 26, 2011|newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|date=June 2, 1975}}</ref>\n\nBonners Ferry is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) from the site of the [[Ruby Ridge]] confrontation and siege in 1992, which occurred just outside Naples, Idaho.\n\n==Geography==\nBonners Ferry is located at {{Coord|48|41|32|N|116|19|3|W|type:city}} (48.692110, \u2212116.317626),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an altitude of 1,896&nbsp;feet (578&nbsp;m).<ref>{{gnis|396163}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|2.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.17|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBonners Ferry has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''/''Dsb'') with cold, snowy winters and dry summers with hot days and cool nights.

Edwin Bonner, a merchant from [[Walla Walla, Washington]], established a ferry in 1864 where the trail crossed the broad [[Kootenai River]]. In 1875, Richard Fry, and his [[Sinixt]] wife, Justine Su-steel Fry, leased the business,<ref>Pryce, Paula. ''Keeping the Lakes Way'', {{ISBN|0-8020-8223-8}}, University of Toronto Press, pp. 166\u20137</ref> but the location retained the name of the original founder and later became the town of Bonners Ferry.\n\nBefore the [[gold rush]], only a few visitors had come to the region; one of the first was explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], a [[cartographer]] for the [[North West Company]]. Thompson and four fellow [[fur trader]]s arrived in 1808 to trade with the Lower Kootenais. The local natives gave Thompson's party dried fish and moss bread.  Thompson returned the next year and established a trading post on [[Lake Pend Oreille]]. He was followed in 1846 by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Priest [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|Father DeSmet]], a missionary to the [[Kootenai Tribe]].<ref name=\"DTSPM\">{{cite web |last1=Nisbet |first1=Jack |title=A place to build a House on |url=http://www.sandpointonline.com/sandpointmag/sms09/david_thompson.html |website=Sandpoint Magazine |publisher=Keokee Co.

Scattered along the valley and benchland were a few ranches and homesteads. Numerous mines were developed in the nearby mountains, including the Continental Mine in the Selkirks. The lumber industry also grew rapidly. Bonners Ferry, perched on stilts to avoid the inevitable spring floods, appeared to be a boom town.\n\nMoving into the 20th century, the town became the center of a lumbering and farming community. The valley land was drained, levees were constructed and farms were cleared on the benches. The rich Kootenai Valley became known as the \"Nile of the North,\" while the Bonners Ferry Lumber Company grew to be one of the world's largest [[lumber mill]]s. The downtown took shape as brick buildings were constructed, replacing those on stilts. Completion of the [[Libby Dam]] in 1975 lessened the threat of serious flooding. Today, much of Main Street dates from this initial period of solid, permanent construction.\n\nOn September 20, 1974, the [[Kootenai Tribe]], headed by chairwoman [[Amy Trice]], declared war on the United States government. Their first act was to post soldiers on each end of the highway that runs through the town and they asked people, to pay a toll to drive through what had been the tribe's aboriginal land. The money would be used to house and care for elderly tribal members. Most tribes in the United States are forbidden to declare war on the U.S. government because of treaties, but the Kootenai Tribe never signed a treaty. The dispute resulted in the concession by the United States government and a land grant of {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} that is now the [[Kootenai Reservation]].<ref name=lewiston2June1976>{{cite news|last=Kuglin|first=John|title=Idaho Indians Reap Spoils Of War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u8ReAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1zEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3257,433563|accessdate=April 26, 2011|newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|date=June 2, 1975}}</ref>\n\nBonners Ferry is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) from the site of the [[Ruby Ridge]] confrontation and siege in 1992, which occurred just outside Naples, Idaho.\n\n==Geography==\nBonners Ferry is located at {{Coord|48|41|32|N|116|19|3|W|type:city}} (48.692110, \u2212116.317626),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an altitude of 1,896&nbsp;feet (578&nbsp;m).<ref>{{gnis|396163}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|2.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.17|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBonners Ferry has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''/''Dsb'') with cold, snowy winters and dry summers with hot days and cool nights.

It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Charlotte Flair]], who is in her record-tying second reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE.

The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]].

A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Charlotte Flair]], who is in her record-tying second reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE. The inaugural champion was [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

{"title_page": "New Order (Indonesia)", "text_new": "{{About|the Indonesian government of the 1960s through 1990s|other uses of the term|New Order (disambiguation)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{History of Indonesia}}\n\nThe '''New Order''' ({{lang-id|Orde Baru}} or ''Orba'') is the term coined by the second Indonesian President [[Suharto]] to characterise his regime as he came to power in [[Transition to the New Order|1966]]. Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, [[Sukarno]] (dubbed the \"Old Order,\" or ''Orde Lama''). The term \"New Order\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966\u20131998).\n\nImmediately following the [[30 September Movement|attempted coup]] in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s,  the \"New Order\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \"New Order\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident [[anti-communism]] remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.\n\nWithin a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the [[1998 Indonesian Revolution]] and then gained power, the term \"New Order\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, [[collusion]] and [[nepotism]] (widely known by the acronym KKN: ''korupsi'', ''kolusi'', ''nepotisme'').<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html Stop talk of KKN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026103742/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html |date=26 October 2014 }}. The Jakarta Post (24 August 2001).</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Liberal democracy period in Indonesia|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[Sukarno]] was Indonesia's founding president, a position he had held since the Republic's formation in 1945. In 1955, the first general parliamentary elections delivered an unstable parliament and from the late 1950s, Sukarno's rule became increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] under his \"[[Guided Democracy]]\". Described as the great \u2018\u2019Dalang\u2019\u2019, or puppet master, Sukarno\u2019s position depended on his concept of [[NASAKOM]] (Nationalism, Religion, Communism) whereby he sought to balance the competing Indonesian Military, Islamic groups, and the increasingly powerful [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). To the resentment of the Military and Muslim groups, this arrangement became increasingly reliant on the PKI which had become the country\u2019s strongest political party.\n\nSukarno\u2019s [[Antiimperialism|anti-imperial]] ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] which was met with indignation from [[Western world|Western]] countries. The cash-strapped government had to scrap public sector subsidies, annual [[inflation]] rose to as high as 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Sukarno\u2019s administration became increasingly ineffective in providing a viable economic system to lift its citizens out of poverty and hunger. Meanwhile, Sukarno led Indonesia into ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', a military confrontation with Malaysia, removed Indonesia from the [[United Nations]], and stepped up revolutionary and anti-Western rhetoric.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pages 52\u201357, {{cite news\n | last = Sheriden\n | first = Greg\n | title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel\n | publisher = The Australian\n | date = 28 January 2008\n | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23118079-5013460,00.html\n | accessdate = 30 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy 1965 at the height of the [[Cold War]], the PKI penetrated all levels of government.

General Suharto led the army in suppressing the abortive coup attempt. The [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI) were quickly blamed and the army led [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366|an anti-communist purge]] which killed an estimated 500,000 to a million people.<ref>{{cite book |last= Robinson|first=Geoffrey B.|date= 2018|title=The Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Massacres, 1965-66|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11135.html|location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=3|isbn=9781400888863|author-link= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Melvin |first=Jess|date= 2018|title=The Army and the Indonesian Genocide: Mechanics of Mass Murder |url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Army-and-the-Indonesian-Genocide-Mechanics-of-Mass-Murder/Melvin/p/book/9781138574694|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=1|isbn=978-1138574694|author-link=}}</ref> Public opinion shifted against Sukarno in part due to his apparent knowledge of, and sympathy for, the events of 30 September, and for his tolerance of leftist and communist elements whom the army blamed for the coup attempt.

[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] was promoted as the national ideology, one that pre-dated introduced religions such as [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]].<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\">{{cite web|author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |title='2 Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |date= |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 ('''Tap MPR No 11/1983''') which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a basic principle. He instituted a Pancasila indoctrination program that must be attended by all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> Pancasila, a rather vague and generalist set of principles originally formulated by Sukarno in 1945, was vigorously promoted as a sacrosanct national ideology which represents the ancient wisdom of Indonesian people even before the entry of foreign-based religions such as [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]]. In a July 1982 speech which reflected his deep infatuation with [[Javanese beliefs]], Suharto glorified Pancasila as a key to reach the perfect life (''ilmu kasampurnaning hurip'') of harmony with God and fellow mankind.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy allowed the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Neutralisation of internal dissent===\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'' as well as Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals HR Dharsono, [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow the participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological [[two-party system]] somewhat similar to those found in many [[Western world|Western]] countries. Suharto then proceeded to send Dharsono overseas as ambassador, while [[Kemal Idris]] and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nWhile many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, it faced large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of the 1971 elections, the ''Golput'' Movement, the costly construction of [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of [[term limit]]s of Suharto's presidency (1978). The New Order responded by imprisoning student activists and sending army units to occupy the campus of the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] in 1978. In April 1978, Suharto ended the campus unrest by issuing a decree on the \"Normalization of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 60-68</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent figures political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]] which criticised Suharto's use of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 86-88</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n\n====Depoliticization====\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR were directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76-77</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184-186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party, the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto took control of an obscure military-run federation of [[Non-governmental organisation|NGOs]] called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Group\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the co-ordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants: [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics. Golkar secured 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of the MPR promptly appointed Suharto to a second term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nOn 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into the [[United Development Party|PPP]] (''Partai Persatuan Pembangunan''/United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]] (''Partai Demokrasi Indonesia''/Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership, while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Golkar won the MPR general elections of [[1977 Indonesian legislative election|1977]], [[1982 Indonesian legislative election|1982]], [[1987 Indonesian legislative election|1987]], [[1992 Indonesian legislative election|1992]], and [[1997 Indonesian legislative election|1997]] with massive landslides. The elected MPR then proceeded to unanimously re-elect Suharto as president in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref>\n\n====Establishment of corporative groups====\n\nSuharto proceeded with social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created and required all civil servants to join KORPRI ({{lang-id|Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia}}, Employees' Corps of the Republic of Indonesia) in November 1971 to ensure their loyalty;<ref group=note>KORPRI still exists today and all civil servants are still required to join the corps.</ref>  organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973 (later renamed as [[Confederation of All Indonesian Workers' Union|SPSI/''Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia'']] in 1985), established under the pretext of [[tripartism]], officially defined as Pancasilaist Industrial Relations ({{lang-id|Hubungan Industrial Pancasila}}) (while in fact it cements only business interests with the state); and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] (''Majelis Ulama Indonesia'') in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimiiation of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of the so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased out, and the ethnic Chinese were encouraged to take [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful [[family planning]] program (''Keluarga Berentjana''/KB) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increase per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|spelling reform]] of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n====\"State Ibuism\"====\nInspired by [[Kejaw\u00e8n|Javanese culture]] of [[priyayi]], the New Order, during its consolidation era, is [[antifeminist]] and [[patriarchy|patriarchic]], which principle is officially called \"familyism\" ({{lang-id|kekeluargaan}}). In 1974, President Suharto established civil servant wives' corps ''Dharma Wanita'', organized under the doctrine of \"Five Women's ''[[Dharma]]''\" ({{lang-id|Pancadharma Wanita}}, an [[antifeminist]], [[patriarchy|patriarchic]] doctrine similar to Nazi Germany's [[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]); a \"Family Training and Welfare\" programme ({{lang-id|[[w:id:Pembinaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga|Pembinaan dan Kesejahteraan Keluarga]]}}, '''PKK'''), which was rooted on a 1957 conference on [[home economics]] in [[Bogor]], was made compulsory in 1972, especially on rural regions.\n\nIt wasn't until 1980 that feminism would gain an uprising with the establishment of several foundations, for example the Annisa Shanti foundation (Yasanti).\n\n====Political stability====\n\nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to the village level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in the [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262-265</ref> Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177-178</ref>\n\nTo comply with the [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before end of 1969, the Suharto government began organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled on July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of the former Dutch-organized militia ([[Papuan Volunteer Corps|''Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps''/ PVK]]) at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963, while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178-279</ref>\n\n===Political Islam===\n\nUnder Suharto [[Islamism|political Islam]]ists were suppressed, and religious Muslims carefully watched by the Indonesian government. Several [[Christianity|Christian]] Generals who served under Suharto like [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] actively persecuted religious Muslims in the Indonesian military, which was described as being \"anti-Islamic\", denying religious Muslims promotions, and preventing them from praying in the barracks and banning them from even using the Islamic greeting \"Salaam Aleikum\", and these anti-Islamic policies were entirely supported by Suharto, despite Suharto being a Muslim himself, since he considered political Islam a threat to his power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/rinvol3no1/east_timor.htm|title=East Timor|author=|date=|website=www.trincoll.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-3.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (3) - Salam Online|author=|date=13 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-2.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (2) - Salam Online|author=|date=8 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-1.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (1) - Salam Online|author=|date=8 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref> The Christian General Theo Syafei, who also served under Suharto, spoke out against political Islam coming to power in Indonesia, and insulted the Qur'an and Islam in remarks which were described as Islamophobic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voa-islam.com/news/indonesiana/2011/04/30/14434/jelang-ajal-sang-islam-phobi-theo-syafei-diserang-kanker-otak-langka/|title=Jelang Ajal, Sang 'Islam Phobi' Theo Syafei Diserang Kanker Otak Langka - VOA-ISLAM.COM|author=|date=|website=voa-islam.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.bekamsteriljakarta.com/2011/04/jelang-ajal-sang-phobi-theo-syafei.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015415/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505023724/http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505002903/http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahmadsumargono.net/konten.php?nama=Buku&op=detail_buku&id_buku=1&id=16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015242/http://www.ahmadsumargono.net/konten.php?nama=Buku&op=detail_buku&id_buku=1&id=16 |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n\nThe new president enlisted a group of mostly American-educated Indonesian [[Economics|economists]], dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate government economic policy. By cutting subsidies and government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation dropped from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of [[famine]] was alleviated by influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments in 1967 to 1968.<ref>J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, \"The New Order and the Economy,\" Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.</ref>\n\nRealizing the dearth of domestic capital capable of re-juvenating growth, Suharto reversed Sukarno's economic [[autarky]] policies by opening selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment under the new Foreign Investment Law of January 1967 (containing generous tax holidays and free movement of money). Suharto himself travelled to Western Europe and [[Japan]] in a series of trips to promote investment into Indonesia, starting in the natural resources sector. Among the first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia were mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] and [[Vale Limited|International Nickel Company]], later followed by significant investment from Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese companies. From 1967, the government managed to secure low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the '''Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia''' (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170-172</ref>\n\nSuharto's government issued the Domestic Investment Law of June 1968 to allow development of a domestic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] class capable of motoring economic growth to supplement existing state-owned enterprises.

While some proceeds of these organisations were used for genuinely charitable purposes (such as building a heart-disease hospital by ''Yayasan Harapan Kita'' run by the first lady), most of the money was recycled as [[slush fund]]s to reward political allies to maintain support for Suharto's regime.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n<ref name=\"KKN\">\n{{cite news\n| last = Koerner\n| first = Brendan\n| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2097858\n| title = How Did Suharto Steal $35 Billion?

Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with [[China]] was suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation with Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into [[civil war]] after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the leftist-leaning [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. After persuasion from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Australia]]n [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene to prevent establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese anti-communist groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] resistance forced the government to maintain strong military presence in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.

In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP whereby 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested into massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites), consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting the [[infant mortality]] rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the main pillar of the economy into [[export]]-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency [[devaluations]]. [[Industrialization]] was mostly undertaken by ethnic-Chinese companies which evolved into immense [[conglomerate (business)|conglomerates]] dominating the nation's economy. The largest conglomeracies are the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of small number of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] conglomerates since they cannot pose political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref>http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40018/3/wp632.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the [[banking]] sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' ({{lang-id|Tabungan Pembangunan Nasional}}, National Development Savings) program to the populace. [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded bull-run due to spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s and influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled strong economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy was coincided by rapid expansion in corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, has grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was [[monopoly|monopolised]] by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, the clove industry monopolized by a Tommy-linked governmental body called the Clove Buffering and Marketing Administration ({{lang-id|Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh}}, BPPC) and even the cinema market monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono. The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family's companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings |publisher=BBC News | date= 25 March 2004 | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Grip on power===\n\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|US Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\n\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was very strong, maintained by emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, and a strong economy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200|last=Ricklefs|first=Merle Calvin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780804744805|location=Stanford, CA|pages=342\u2013387}}</ref> Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook re-organization of the armed forces that concentrates power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces. A tough and capable soldier, Moerdani is also a Roman Catholic, which precluded him from posing a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nSuharto ruthlessly suppressed elements who disturbed the tranquility of the New Order society. From 1983 to 1985, army death squads murdered up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in crime rate (dubbed \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] as sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considers the Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'') to be above any human conceptions. In September 1984, a violent demonstration in the [[Tanjung Priok]] area of Jakarta by conservative Muslims led to soldiers [[Tanjung Priok massacre|opening fire]], massacring up to 100 protesters. A retaliatory series of small bombings (notably the bombing of [[Borobudur]] Temple in January 1985) led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, ranging from future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa to radical cleric [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (future initiator of terrorist group [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by resurgent [[Libya]]n-aided [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a brutal military operation (\"''[[1990\u201398 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|Operasi Jaring Merah]]''\") which ended the insurgency by 1992 by killing of 2,000 people. More subtly, the Suharto government sought to better control the press by issuing a 1984 law requiring all media to possess a press operating licence (''SIUPP'') which can be revoked at any time by the Ministry of Information.       \n<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nIn the international arena, Western concern over Communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The November 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in [[Dili]], East Timor, resulted in the [[Congress of the United States]] passing limitations on [[IMET]] assistance to the Indonesian Military. Suharto retaliated by cancelling purchase orders for American [[F-16]] fighter jets in 1997.<ref name=\"HR_IMET\">{{cite web | title=H.AMDT.647 (A003): An amendment to prohibit any funds appropriated in the bill to be used for military education and training assistance to Indonesia | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | publisher=THOMAS (Library of Congress) | accessdate=4 February 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113050730/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | archivedate=13 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"UNHCHR\">{{cite web | title= United Nations High Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/97: Situation in East Timor | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/81427c9bacaf9847c1256c6800603ff2?Opendocument | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref> When [[Netherlands]] condemned the Santa Cruz Massacre, Suharto retaliated by expelling the Dutch from IGGI in March 1992 and renaming this aid organisation into '''Consultative Group on Indonesia''' (CGI) which continued increasing aid to Indonesia.<ref>Elson (2001), p.501-503</ref> Realizing this trend, Suharto sought wider alliances under the rubric of economic development, away from over-reliance to [[United States]] support. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia is a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510-511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the growing rapaciousness of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. In the March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. After General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani|Moerdani]] voiced his objections on Suharto family's corruption, the president dismissed him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarize\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242-264</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicized [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up name of '''Haji Mohammad Suharto''', started promoting Islamic values into society, and promoted the careers of Islamic-oriented generals (dubbed the \"green generals\"). To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protege [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period of Suharto's cozying with Islamists, race riots against ethnic-Chinese began to occur quite regularly, beginning with the April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by sycophantic civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when several prominent Indonesian magazines criticised Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), Suharto ordered the offending publications to be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\"/>\n\nBy the 1990s, elements the growing Indonesian [[middle class]] created by Suharto's economic development, was becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Reformasi (Indonesia)|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the 30-year-old New Order system. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by waves of arrests on 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped (some were murdered) by army squads called ''Tim Mawar'' (\"Rose Team\") led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref> Regardless of these incidents, as late as mid-1997, Suharto's grip on power seemed as secure as ever with the military led by his loyalists, all opposition groups suppressed, and the economy in good shape.\n\n==Downfall==\n\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his address of resignation at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

In the private sector, many Indonesian corporations had been borrowing heavily in lower-interest US dollar denomination while their revenues were mostly in rupiah; their debt rapidly increased as the US dollar appreciated, leaving many companies virtually bankrupt. These companies desperately sold rupiah and bought US dollars, causing the rupiah's value to drop from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend its managed float regime by selling dollar had little impact and instead drained Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves, forcing the government to free-float the currency and seek liquidity aid from [[IMF]] (International Monetary Fund).<ref>http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0152.pdf</ref>\n\nIn exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto was forced to sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a [[bank run]] that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit to the corporate sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref> According to American economist [[Steve Hanke]], invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan [[currency board]] system, President [[Bill Clinton]] and IMF managing director [[Michel Camdessus]] deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/fall-rupiah-suharto |title=On the Fall of the Rupiah and Suharto &#124; Cato Institute |publisher=Cato.org |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nEconomic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while bloody ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. After violent campaign season, [[Golkar]] won the heavily rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|May 1997 MPR elections]]. The new MPR voted unanimously to re-elect Suharto to another five-year term in office in March 1998, upon which he proceeded to appoint his protege [[BJ Habibie]] as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] became Minister of Social Affairs). Government's increase of fuel prices by 70% of 4 May triggered anti-Chinese rioting in [[Medan]]. With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures spoke out against his presidency (notably Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]]), and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.<ref>Elson (2001), p.267</ref>\n\nIn [[West Kalimantan]] there was communal violence between [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] in 1996, in the [[Sambas conflict]] in 1999 and the [[Sampit conflict]] 2001, resulting in large-scale massacres of Madurese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-IndonesiaKalimantan.html|title=404 Error - Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=ploughshares.ca}}</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/dayak.htm Dayak]</ref><ref>[http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAYAK AND MADURA IN RETOK by Yohanes Supriyadi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324143522/http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html |date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> In the Sambas conflict, both [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] and Dayaks massacred Madurese.\n\nThe crisis climaxed when Suharto was on a state visit to [[Egypt]] in May 1998. Security forces [[Trisakti shootings|killed four student demonstrators]] from Jakarta's [[Trisakti University]] on 12 May 1998, which was followed by [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|anti-Chinese rioting and looting across Jakarta and some other cities]] on 13\u201315 May that destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Various theories exist on the origins of the racial pogrom against the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic-Chinese]]. One theory suggested rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Prabowo Subianto]], while another theory suggested deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students occupied the [[DPR/MPR Building|parliament building]], demanding Suharto's resignation. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he tried to defend his presidency by offering to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to military chief [[Wiranto]], on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security (similar to the 1966 [[Supersemar]]), however Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president [[B.

Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, [[Sukarno]] (dubbed the \"Old Order,\" or ''Orde Lama''). The term \"New Order\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966\u20131998).\n\nImmediately following the [[30 September Movement|attempted coup]] in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s,  the \"New Order\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \"New Order\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident [[anti-communism]] remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.\n\nWithin a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the [[1998 Indonesian Revolution]] and then gained power, the term \"New Order\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, [[collusion]] and [[nepotism]] (widely known by the acronym KKN: ''korupsi'', ''kolusi'', ''nepotisme'').<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html Stop talk of KKN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026103742/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html |date=26 October 2014 }}.

In 1955, the first general parliamentary elections delivered an unstable parliament and from the late 1950s, Sukarno's rule became increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] under his \"[[Guided Democracy]]\". Described as the great \u2018\u2019Dalang\u2019\u2019, or puppet master, Sukarno\u2019s position depended on his concept of [[NASAKOM]] (Nationalism, Religion, Communism) whereby he sought to balance the competing Indonesian Military, Islamic groups, and the increasingly powerful [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). To the resentment of the Military and Muslim groups, this arrangement became increasingly reliant on the PKI which had become the country\u2019s strongest political party.\n\nSukarno\u2019s [[Antiimperialism|anti-imperial]] ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] which was met with indignation from [[Western world|Western]] countries. The cash-strapped government had to scrap public sector subsidies, annual [[inflation]] rose to as high as 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Sukarno\u2019s administration became increasingly ineffective in providing a viable economic system to lift its citizens out of poverty and hunger. Meanwhile, Sukarno led Indonesia into ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', a military confrontation with Malaysia, removed Indonesia from the [[United Nations]], and stepped up revolutionary and anti-Western rhetoric.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pages 52\u201357, {{cite news\n | last = Sheriden\n | first = Greg\n | title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel\n | publisher = The Australian\n | date = 28 January 2008\n | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23118079-5013460,00.html\n | accessdate = 30 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy 1965 at the height of the [[Cold War]], the PKI penetrated all levels of government.

General Suharto led the army in suppressing the abortive coup attempt. The [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI) were quickly blamed and the army led [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366|an anti-communist purge]] which killed an estimated 500,000 to a million people.<ref>{{cite book |last= Robinson|first=Geoffrey B.|date= 2018|title=The Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Massacres, 1965-66|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11135.html|location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=3|isbn=9781400888863|author-link= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Melvin |first=Jess|date= 2018|title=The Army and the Indonesian Genocide: Mechanics of Mass Murder |url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Army-and-the-Indonesian-Genocide-Mechanics-of-Mass-Murder/Melvin/p/book/9781138574694|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=1|isbn=978-1138574694|author-link=}}</ref> Public opinion shifted against Sukarno in part due to his apparent knowledge of, and sympathy for, the events of 30 September, and for his tolerance of leftist and communist elements whom the army blamed for the coup attempt. Student groups, such as [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]], were encouraged by, and sided with, the Army against Sukarno. In March 1966, Suharto secured a presidential decree (known as the [[Supersemar]]), which gave him authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\">Vickers (2005), page 160</ref> Using the decree, the PKI was banned in March 1966 and the parliament ([[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]]), government and military were purged of pro-Sukarno elements many of whom were accused of being communist sympathisers, and who were replaced with Suharto supporters.<ref name=\"ELSON7\">{{cite book | first = R.E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography | pages = 130\u2013135 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | isbn = 0-521-77326-1}}</ref>\n\nA June session of the now-purged parliament banned [[Marxism-Leninism]], ratified the Supersemar, and stripped Sukarno of his title of [[president for life]].

Parliament re-convened in March 1967 to [[Impeachment|impeach]] the President for his apparent toleration of 30 September Movement and violation of the constitution by promoting PKI's international communist agenda, negligence of the economy, and promotion of national \"moral degradation\" via his womanising behaviour.

[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] was promoted as the national ideology, one that pre-dated introduced religions such as [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]].<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\">{{cite web|author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |title='2 Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |date= |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 ('''Tap MPR No 11/1983''') which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a basic principle. He instituted a Pancasila indoctrination program that must be attended by all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> Pancasila, a rather vague and generalist set of principles originally formulated by Sukarno in 1945, was vigorously promoted as a sacrosanct national ideology which represents the ancient wisdom of Indonesian people even before the entry of foreign-based religions such as [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]]. In a July 1982 speech which reflected his deep infatuation with [[Javanese beliefs]], Suharto glorified Pancasila as a key to reach the perfect life (''ilmu kasampurnaning hurip'') of harmony with God and fellow mankind.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy allowed the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Neutralisation of internal dissent===\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'' as well as Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals HR Dharsono, [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow the participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological [[two-party system]] somewhat similar to those found in many [[Western world|Western]] countries. Suharto then proceeded to send Dharsono overseas as ambassador, while [[Kemal Idris]] and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nWhile many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, it faced large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of the 1971 elections, the ''Golput'' Movement, the costly construction of [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of [[term limit]]s of Suharto's presidency (1978). The New Order responded by imprisoning student activists and sending army units to occupy the campus of the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] in 1978. In April 1978, Suharto ended the campus unrest by issuing a decree on the \"Normalization of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 60-68</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent figures political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]] which criticised Suharto's use of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 86-88</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n\n====Depoliticization====\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR were directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76-77</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184-186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party, the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto took control of an obscure military-run federation of [[Non-governmental organisation|NGOs]] called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Group\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the co-ordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants: [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics. Golkar secured 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of the MPR promptly appointed Suharto to a second term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nOn 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into the [[United Development Party|PPP]] (''Partai Persatuan Pembangunan''/United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]] (''Partai Demokrasi Indonesia''/Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership, while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Golkar won the MPR general elections of [[1977 Indonesian legislative election|1977]], [[1982 Indonesian legislative election|1982]], [[1987 Indonesian legislative election|1987]], [[1992 Indonesian legislative election|1992]], and [[1997 Indonesian legislative election|1997]] with massive landslides. The elected MPR then proceeded to unanimously re-elect Suharto as president in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref>\n\n====Establishment of corporative groups====\n\nSuharto proceeded with social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created and required all civil servants to join KORPRI ({{lang-id|Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia}}, Employees' Corps of the Republic of Indonesia) in November 1971 to ensure their loyalty;<ref group=note>KORPRI still exists today and all civil servants are still required to join the corps.</ref>  organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973 (later renamed as [[Confederation of All Indonesian Workers' Union|SPSI/''Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia'']] in 1985), established under the pretext of [[tripartism]], officially defined as Pancasilaist Industrial Relations ({{lang-id|Hubungan Industrial Pancasila}}) (while in fact it cements only business interests with the state); and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] (''Majelis Ulama Indonesia'') in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimiiation of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of the so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased out, and the ethnic Chinese were encouraged to take [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful [[family planning]] program (''Keluarga Berentjana''/KB) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increase per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|spelling reform]] of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n====\"State Ibuism\"====\nInspired by [[Kejaw\u00e8n|Javanese culture]] of [[priyayi]], the New Order, during its consolidation era, is [[antifeminist]] and [[patriarchy|patriarchic]], which principle is officially called \"familyism\" ({{lang-id|kekeluargaan}}). In 1974, President Suharto established civil servant wives' corps ''Dharma Wanita'', organized under the doctrine of \"Five Women's ''[[Dharma]]''\" ({{lang-id|Pancadharma Wanita}}, an [[antifeminist]], [[patriarchy|patriarchic]] doctrine similar to Nazi Germany's [[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]); a \"Family Training and Welfare\" programme ({{lang-id|[[w:id:Pembinaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga|Pembinaan dan Kesejahteraan Keluarga]]}}, '''PKK'''), which was rooted on a 1957 conference on [[home economics]] in [[Bogor]], was made compulsory in 1972, especially on rural regions.\n\nIt wasn't until 1980 that feminism would gain an uprising with the establishment of several foundations, for example the Annisa Shanti foundation (Yasanti).\n\n====Political stability====\n\nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to the village level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in the [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262-265</ref> Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177-178</ref>\n\nTo comply with the [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before end of 1969, the Suharto government began organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled on July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of the former Dutch-organized militia ([[Papuan Volunteer Corps|''Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps''/ PVK]]) at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963, while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178-279</ref>\n\n===Political Islam===\n\nUnder Suharto [[Islamism|political Islam]]ists were suppressed, and religious Muslims carefully watched by the Indonesian government. Several [[Christianity|Christian]] Generals who served under Suharto like [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] actively persecuted religious Muslims in the Indonesian military, which was described as being \"anti-Islamic\", denying religious Muslims promotions, and preventing them from praying in the barracks and banning them from even using the Islamic greeting \"Salaam Aleikum\", and these anti-Islamic policies were entirely supported by Suharto, despite Suharto being a Muslim himself, since he considered political Islam a threat to his power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/rinvol3no1/east_timor.htm|title=East Timor|author=|date=|website=www.trincoll.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-3.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (3) - Salam Online|author=|date=13 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-2.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (2) - Salam Online|author=|date=8 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-1.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (1) - Salam Online|author=|date=8 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref> The Christian General Theo Syafei, who also served under Suharto, spoke out against political Islam coming to power in Indonesia, and insulted the Qur'an and Islam in remarks which were described as Islamophobic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voa-islam.com/news/indonesiana/2011/04/30/14434/jelang-ajal-sang-islam-phobi-theo-syafei-diserang-kanker-otak-langka/|title=Jelang Ajal, Sang 'Islam Phobi' Theo Syafei Diserang Kanker Otak Langka - VOA-ISLAM.COM|author=|date=|website=voa-islam.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.bekamsteriljakarta.com/2011/04/jelang-ajal-sang-phobi-theo-syafei.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015415/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505023724/http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505002903/http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahmadsumargono.net/konten.php?nama=Buku&op=detail_buku&id_buku=1&id=16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015242/http://www.ahmadsumargono.net/konten.php?nama=Buku&op=detail_buku&id_buku=1&id=16 |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n\nThe new president enlisted a group of mostly American-educated Indonesian [[Economics|economists]], dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate government economic policy. By cutting subsidies and government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation dropped from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969.

Suharto himself travelled to Western Europe and [[Japan]] in a series of trips to promote investment into Indonesia, starting in the natural resources sector. Among the first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia were mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] and [[Vale Limited|International Nickel Company]], later followed by significant investment from Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese companies. From 1967, the government managed to secure low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the '''Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia''' (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170-172</ref>\n\nSuharto's government issued the Domestic Investment Law of June 1968 to allow development of a domestic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] class capable of motoring economic growth to supplement existing state-owned enterprises.

While some proceeds of these organisations were used for genuinely charitable purposes (such as building a heart-disease hospital by ''Yayasan Harapan Kita'' run by the first lady), most of the money was recycled as [[slush fund]]s to reward political allies to maintain support for Suharto's regime.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n<ref name=\"KKN\">\n{{cite news\n| last = Koerner\n| first = Brendan\n| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2097858\n| title = How Did Suharto Steal $35 Billion?

The company's director, General [[Ibnu Sutowo]] (a close ally of Suharto), invested the windfall income from rising oil prices into a myriad of other business activities such as shipping, steel, construction, real estate, and hospitals. These businesses were mismanaged and riddled with corruption. The government was forced to bail out the company, in the process nearly doubling the [[national debt]], while Ibnu Sutowo was removed from his position.<ref>Schwatrz (1994)</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n\n[[File:SuhartoNAMLusaka1970.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto attends 1970 meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Lusaka]].]]\n\nUpon assuming power, Suharto government adopted a policy of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in the [[Cold War]] with quiet alignment with the [[Western Bloc|Western bloc]] (including [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]) with the objective of securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with [[China]] was suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation with Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into [[civil war]] after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the leftist-leaning [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. After persuasion from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Australia]]n [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene to prevent establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese anti-communist groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] resistance forced the government to maintain strong military presence in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.

In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP whereby 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested into massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites), consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting the [[infant mortality]] rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the main pillar of the economy into [[export]]-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency [[devaluations]]. [[Industrialization]] was mostly undertaken by ethnic-Chinese companies which evolved into immense [[conglomerate (business)|conglomerates]] dominating the nation's economy. The largest conglomeracies are the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of small number of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] conglomerates since they cannot pose political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref>http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40018/3/wp632.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the [[banking]] sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' ({{lang-id|Tabungan Pembangunan Nasional}}, National Development Savings) program to the populace. [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded bull-run due to spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s and influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled strong economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy was coincided by rapid expansion in corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, has grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was [[monopoly|monopolised]] by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, the clove industry monopolized by a Tommy-linked governmental body called the Clove Buffering and Marketing Administration ({{lang-id|Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh}}, BPPC) and even the cinema market monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono. The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family's companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings |publisher=BBC News | date= 25 March 2004 | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Grip on power===\n\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|US Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\n\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was very strong, maintained by emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, and a strong economy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200|last=Ricklefs|first=Merle Calvin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780804744805|location=Stanford, CA|pages=342\u2013387}}</ref> Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook re-organization of the armed forces that concentrates power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces. A tough and capable soldier, Moerdani is also a Roman Catholic, which precluded him from posing a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nSuharto ruthlessly suppressed elements who disturbed the tranquility of the New Order society. From 1983 to 1985, army death squads murdered up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in crime rate (dubbed \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] as sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considers the Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'') to be above any human conceptions. In September 1984, a violent demonstration in the [[Tanjung Priok]] area of Jakarta by conservative Muslims led to soldiers [[Tanjung Priok massacre|opening fire]], massacring up to 100 protesters. A retaliatory series of small bombings (notably the bombing of [[Borobudur]] Temple in January 1985) led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, ranging from future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa to radical cleric [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (future initiator of terrorist group [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by resurgent [[Libya]]n-aided [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a brutal military operation (\"''[[1990\u201398 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|Operasi Jaring Merah]]''\") which ended the insurgency by 1992 by killing of 2,000 people. More subtly, the Suharto government sought to better control the press by issuing a 1984 law requiring all media to possess a press operating licence (''SIUPP'') which can be revoked at any time by the Ministry of Information.       \n<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nIn the international arena, Western concern over Communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The November 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in [[Dili]], East Timor, resulted in the [[Congress of the United States]] passing limitations on [[IMET]] assistance to the Indonesian Military. Suharto retaliated by cancelling purchase orders for American [[F-16]] fighter jets in 1997.<ref name=\"HR_IMET\">{{cite web | title=H.AMDT.647 (A003): An amendment to prohibit any funds appropriated in the bill to be used for military education and training assistance to Indonesia | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | publisher=THOMAS (Library of Congress) | accessdate=4 February 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113050730/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | archivedate=13 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"UNHCHR\">{{cite web | title= United Nations High Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/97: Situation in East Timor | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/81427c9bacaf9847c1256c6800603ff2?Opendocument | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref> When [[Netherlands]] condemned the Santa Cruz Massacre, Suharto retaliated by expelling the Dutch from IGGI in March 1992 and renaming this aid organisation into '''Consultative Group on Indonesia''' (CGI) which continued increasing aid to Indonesia.<ref>Elson (2001), p.501-503</ref> Realizing this trend, Suharto sought wider alliances under the rubric of economic development, away from over-reliance to [[United States]] support. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia is a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510-511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the growing rapaciousness of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. In the March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. After General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani|Moerdani]] voiced his objections on Suharto family's corruption, the president dismissed him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarize\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242-264</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicized [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up name of '''Haji Mohammad Suharto''', started promoting Islamic values into society, and promoted the careers of Islamic-oriented generals (dubbed the \"green generals\"). To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protege [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period of Suharto's cozying with Islamists, race riots against ethnic-Chinese began to occur quite regularly, beginning with the April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by sycophantic civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when several prominent Indonesian magazines criticised Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), Suharto ordered the offending publications to be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\"/>\n\nBy the 1990s, elements the growing Indonesian [[middle class]] created by Suharto's economic development, was becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Reformasi (Indonesia)|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the 30-year-old New Order system. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by waves of arrests on 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped (some were murdered) by army squads called ''Tim Mawar'' (\"Rose Team\") led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref> Regardless of these incidents, as late as mid-1997, Suharto's grip on power seemed as secure as ever with the military led by his loyalists, all opposition groups suppressed, and the economy in good shape.\n\n==Downfall==\n\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his address of resignation at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

In the private sector, many Indonesian corporations had been borrowing heavily in lower-interest US dollar denomination while their revenues were mostly in rupiah; their debt rapidly increased as the US dollar appreciated, leaving many companies virtually bankrupt. These companies desperately sold rupiah and bought US dollars, causing the rupiah's value to drop from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend its managed float regime by selling dollar had little impact and instead drained Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves, forcing the government to free-float the currency and seek liquidity aid from [[IMF]] (International Monetary Fund).<ref>http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0152.pdf</ref>\n\nIn exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto was forced to sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a [[bank run]] that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit to the corporate sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref> According to American economist [[Steve Hanke]], invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan [[currency board]] system, President [[Bill Clinton]] and IMF managing director [[Michel Camdessus]] deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/fall-rupiah-suharto |title=On the Fall of the Rupiah and Suharto &#124; Cato Institute |publisher=Cato.org |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nEconomic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while bloody ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. After violent campaign season, [[Golkar]] won the heavily rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|May 1997 MPR elections]]. The new MPR voted unanimously to re-elect Suharto to another five-year term in office in March 1998, upon which he proceeded to appoint his protege [[BJ Habibie]] as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] became Minister of Social Affairs). Government's increase of fuel prices by 70% of 4 May triggered anti-Chinese rioting in [[Medan]]. With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures spoke out against his presidency (notably Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]]), and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.<ref>Elson (2001), p.267</ref>\n\nIn [[West Kalimantan]] there was communal violence between [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] in 1996, in the [[Sambas conflict]] in 1999 and the [[Sampit conflict]] 2001, resulting in large-scale massacres of Madurese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-IndonesiaKalimantan.html|title=404 Error - Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=ploughshares.ca}}</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/dayak.htm Dayak]</ref><ref>[http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAYAK AND MADURA IN RETOK by Yohanes Supriyadi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324143522/http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html |date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> In the Sambas conflict, both [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] and Dayaks massacred Madurese.\n\nThe crisis climaxed when Suharto was on a state visit to [[Egypt]] in May 1998. Security forces [[Trisakti shootings|killed four student demonstrators]] from Jakarta's [[Trisakti University]] on 12 May 1998, which was followed by [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|anti-Chinese rioting and looting across Jakarta and some other cities]] on 13\u201315 May that destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Various theories exist on the origins of the racial pogrom against the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic-Chinese]]. One theory suggested rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Prabowo Subianto]], while another theory suggested deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students occupied the [[DPR/MPR Building|parliament building]], demanding Suharto's resignation. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he tried to defend his presidency by offering to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to military chief [[Wiranto]], on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security (similar to the 1966 [[Supersemar]]), however Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president [[B.

{"title_page": "Numeral prefix", "text_new": "{{Redir|semi-|other uses|semi (disambiguation)}}\n'''Numeral''' or '''number prefixes''' are [[prefix]]es derived from [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s or occasionally other [[number]]s. In English and other European languages, they are used to coin numerous series of words, such as:\n<blockquote>''unicycle \u2013 bicycle \u2013 tricycle'', ''dyad \u2013 triad \u2013 decade, biped \u2013 quadruped, September \u2013 October \u2013 November \u2013 December, decimal \u2013 hexadecimal, sexagenarian \u2013 octogenarian, centipede \u2013 millipede'', etc.</blockquote>\nThere are two principal systems, taken from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], each with several subsystems; in addition, [[Sanskrit]] occupies a marginal position.<ref name=\"Sanskrit\">See [[Mendeleev's predicted elements]] for the most common use of Sanskrit numerical prefixes.</ref> There is also an international set of [[metric prefix]]es, which are used in the [[metric system]] and which for the most part are either distorted from the forms below or not based on actual number words.\n\n== Table of number prefixes in English ==\nIn the following prefixes, a final vowel is normally dropped before a root that begins with a vowel, with the exceptions of ''bi-,'' which is ''bis-'' before a vowel, and of the other [[monosyllable]]s, ''du-, di-, dvi-, tri-,'' which are invariable.\n\nThe ''cardinal'' series are derived from [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s, such as the English ''one, two, three.'' The ''multiple'' series are based on adverbial numbers like the English ''once, twice, thrice.'' The ''distributive'' series originally meant ''one each, two each'' or ''one by one, two by two,'' etc., though that meaning is now frequently lost. The ''ordinal'' series are based on [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s such as the English ''first, second, third'' (for numbers higher than 2, the ordinal forms are also used for fractions; only the fraction {{frac|1|2}} has special forms).\n\nFor the hundreds, there are competing forms: those in ''-gent-'', from the original Latin, and those in ''-cent-'', derived from ''centi-'', etc. plus the prefixes for 1&ndash;9.\n{| class=wikitable\n! rowspan=2|Number !! colspan=4| Latin prefixes !! colspan=3|Greek prefixes{{efn|The numbering adjectives in Greek are inflectional for [[grammatical gender]] (i.e. there is monos ''[masculine for single/alone]'', mone ''[feminine for single/alone]'' and monon ''[neuter for single/alone]''), [[grammatical case]] (i.e. nominative, genitive, etc.) and [[grammatical number]] (singular/plural). The prefixes are produced from the default grammatical type (masculine/nominative/singular). }}!! rowspan=\"2\" |Sanskrit<ref name=\"Sanskrit\"/>\n|-\n! Cardinal !! Multiple !! Distributive !!

used in relation to or that are the names of technological innovations, such as [[Wiktionary:hexadecimal|hexadecimal]] and [[Wiktionary:bicycle|bicycle]]. Also used in medals that commemorate an [[anniversary]], such as sesquicentennial (150 years), [[centennial]] (100 years), or [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] (200 years).\n* They occur in constructed words such as [[systematic name]]s. Systematic names use numerical prefixes derived from Greek, with one principal exception, [[Wiktionary:nona-|nona-]].\n* They occur as prefixes to units of measure in the [[SI]] system. See [[SI prefix]].\n* They occur as prefixes to units of computer data. See [[binary prefixes]].\n* They occur in words in the same languages as the original number word, and their respective derivatives. (Strictly speaking, some of the common citations of these occurrences are ''not'' in fact occurrences of the prefixes. For example: [[Wiktionary:millennium|millennium]] is not formed from [[Wiktionary:milli-|milli-]], but is in fact derived from the same shared Latin root &ndash; [[Wiktionary:mille|mille]].)\n\nBecause of the common inheritance of Greek and Latin roots across the [[Romance language]]s, the import of much of that derived vocabulary into non-Romance languages (such as into [[English language|English]] via [[Norman language|Norman French]]), and the [[loanwords|borrowing]] of 19th and 20th century coinages into many languages, the same numerical prefixes occur in many languages.\n\nNumerical prefixes are not restricted to denoting integers. Some of the SI prefixes denote negative powers of 10, i.e. division by a multiple of 10 rather than multiplication by it. Several common-use numerical prefixes denote [[vulgar fraction]]s.\n\nWords containing non-technical numerical prefixes are usually not hyphenated. This is not an absolute rule, however, and there are exceptions (for example: [[Wiktionary:quarter-deck|quarter-deck]] occurs in addition to [[Wiktionary:quarterdeck|quarterdeck]]). There are no exceptions for words comprising technical numerical prefixes, though. [[Systematic name]]s and words comprising [[SI prefix]]es and binary prefixes are not hyphenated, by definition.\n\nNonetheless, for clarity, dictionaries list numerical prefixes in hyphenated form, to distinguish the prefixes from words with the same spellings (such as [[Wiktionary:duo-|duo-]] and [[Wiktionary:duo|duo]]).\n\nSeveral technical numerical prefixes are not derived from words for numbers. ([[Wiktionary:mega-|mega-]] is not derived from a number word, for example.) Similarly, some are only derived from words for numbers inasmuch as they are [[word play]]. ([[Wiktionary:peta-|Peta-]] is word play on [[Wiktionary:penta-|penta-]], for example. See its etymology for details.)\n\nThe root language of a numerical prefix need not be related to the root language of the word that it prefixes. Some words comprising numerical prefixes are [[hybrid word]]s.\n\nIn certain classes of systematic names, there are a few other exceptions to the rule of using Greek-derived numerical prefixes. The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]], for example, uses the numerical prefixes derived from Greek, except for the prefix for 9 (as mentioned) and the prefixes from 1 to 4 (meth-, eth-, prop-, and but-), which are not derived from words for numbers. These prefixes were invented by the IUPAC, deriving them from the pre-existing names for several compounds that it was intended to preserve in the new system: [[wikt:methane|methane]] (via [[wikt:methyl|methyl]], which is in turn from the Greek word for wine), [[wikt:ethane|ethane]] (from [[wikt:ethyl|ethyl]] coined by [[Justus von Liebig]] in 1834), [[wikt:propane|propane]] (from [[wikt:propionic|propionic]], which is in turn from [[wikt:pro-|pro-]] and the Greek word for fat), and [[wikt:butane|butane]] (from [[wikt:butyl|butyl]], which is in turn from [[wikt:butyric|butyric]], which is in turn from the Latin word for butter).\n\n===Cardinal Latin series===\n* [[unicycle]], [[bicycle]], [[tricycle]], [[quadricycle]]\n* [[uniped]], [[biped]], [[triped]], [[quadruped]],<ref name=quadru /> [[centipede]], [[millipede]]\n\n===Distributive Latin series===\n*unary, binary, trinary, quaternary, quinary, senary, \u2026 vicenary \u2026 centenary \u2026\n*denarian, vicenarian, tricenarian, quadragenarian, quinquagenarian, sexagenarian, septuagenarian, octogenarian, nonagenarian, centenarian, \u2026 millenarian\n\n===Greek series===\n* [[monad (disambiguation)|monad]], [[dyad (disambiguation)|dyad]], [[triad (disambiguation)|triad]], tetrad, [[pentad (disambiguation)|pentad]], hexad, heptad, ogdoad, [[ennead]], decad, ... triacontad, ... hecatontad, [[chiliad]], [[myriad]]\n* [[digon]], trigon, [[tetragon]], [[pentagon]], [[hexagon]], [[heptagon]], [[octagon]], [[enneagon]], [[decagon]], [[hendecagon]], [[dodecagon]], ...

The ''multiple'' series are based on adverbial numbers like the English ''once, twice, thrice.'' The ''distributive'' series originally meant ''one each, two each'' or ''one by one, two by two,'' etc., though that meaning is now frequently lost. The ''ordinal'' series are based on [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s such as the English ''first, second, third'' (for numbers higher than 2, the ordinal forms are also used for fractions; only the fraction {{frac|1|2}} has special forms).\n\nFor the hundreds, there are competing forms: those in ''-gent-'', from the original Latin, and those in ''-cent-'', derived from ''centi-'', etc. plus the prefixes for 1&ndash;9.\n{| class=wikitable\n! rowspan=2|Number !! colspan=4| Latin prefixes !! colspan=3|Greek prefixes{{efn|The numbering adjectives in Greek are inflectional for [[grammatical gender]] (i.e. there is monos ''[masculine for single/alone]'', mone ''[feminine for single/alone]'' and monon ''[neuter for single/alone]''), [[grammatical case]] (i.e. nominative, genitive, etc.) and [[grammatical number]] (singular/plural).

used in relation to or that are the names of technological innovations, such as [[Wiktionary:hexadecimal|hexadecimal]] and [[Wiktionary:bicycle|bicycle]]. Also used in medals that commemorate an [[anniversary]], such as sesquicentennial (150 years), [[centennial]] (100 years), or [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] (200 years).\n* They occur in constructed words such as [[systematic name]]s. Systematic names use numerical prefixes derived from Greek, with one principal exception, [[Wiktionary:nona-|nona-]].\n* They occur as prefixes to units of measure in the [[SI]] system. See [[SI prefix]].\n* They occur as prefixes to units of computer data. See [[binary prefixes]].\n* They occur in words in the same languages as the original number word, and their respective derivatives. (Strictly speaking, some of the common citations of these occurrences are ''not'' in fact occurrences of the prefixes. For example: [[Wiktionary:millennium|millennium]] is not formed from [[Wiktionary:milli-|milli-]], but is in fact derived from the same shared Latin root &ndash; [[Wiktionary:mille|mille]].)\n\nBecause of the common inheritance of Greek and Latin roots across the [[Romance language]]s, the import of much of that derived vocabulary into non-Romance languages (such as into [[English language|English]] via [[Norman language|Norman French]]), and the [[loanwords|borrowing]] of 19th and 20th century coinages into many languages, the same numerical prefixes occur in many languages.\n\nNumerical prefixes are not restricted to denoting integers. Some of the SI prefixes denote negative powers of 10, i.e. division by a multiple of 10 rather than multiplication by it. Several common-use numerical prefixes denote [[vulgar fraction]]s.\n\nWords containing non-technical numerical prefixes are usually not hyphenated. This is not an absolute rule, however, and there are exceptions (for example: [[Wiktionary:quarter-deck|quarter-deck]] occurs in addition to [[Wiktionary:quarterdeck|quarterdeck]]). There are no exceptions for words comprising technical numerical prefixes, though. [[Systematic name]]s and words comprising [[SI prefix]]es and binary prefixes are not hyphenated, by definition.\n\nNonetheless, for clarity, dictionaries list numerical prefixes in hyphenated form, to distinguish the prefixes from words with the same spellings (such as [[Wiktionary:duo-|duo-]] and [[Wiktionary:duo|duo]]).\n\nSeveral technical numerical prefixes are not derived from words for numbers. ([[Wiktionary:mega-|mega-]] is not derived from a number word, for example.) Similarly, some are only derived from words for numbers inasmuch as they are [[word play]]. ([[Wiktionary:peta-|Peta-]] is word play on [[Wiktionary:penta-|penta-]], for example. See its etymology for details.)\n\nThe root language of a numerical prefix need not be related to the root language of the word that it prefixes. Some words comprising numerical prefixes are [[hybrid word]]s.\n\nIn certain classes of systematic names, there are a few other exceptions to the rule of using Greek-derived numerical prefixes. The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]], for example, uses the numerical prefixes derived from Greek, except for the prefix for 9 (as mentioned) and the prefixes from 1 to 4 (meth-, eth-, prop-, and but-), which are not derived from words for numbers. These prefixes were invented by the IUPAC, deriving them from the pre-existing names for several compounds that it was intended to preserve in the new system: [[wikt:methane|methane]] (via [[wikt:methyl|methyl]], which is in turn from the Greek word for wine), [[wikt:ethane|ethane]] (from [[wikt:ethyl|ethyl]] coined by [[Justus von Liebig]] in 1834), [[wikt:propane|propane]] (from [[wikt:propionic|propionic]], which is in turn from [[wikt:pro-|pro-]] and the Greek word for fat), and [[wikt:butane|butane]] (from [[wikt:butyl|butyl]], which is in turn from [[wikt:butyric|butyric]], which is in turn from the Latin word for butter).\n\n===Cardinal Latin series===\n* [[unicycle]], [[bicycle]], [[tricycle]], [[quadricycle]]\n* [[uniped]], [[biped]], [[triped]], [[quadruped]],<ref name=quadru /> [[centipede]], [[millipede]]\n\n===Distributive Latin series===\n*unary, binary, trinary, quaternary, quinary, senary, \u2026 vicenary \u2026 centenary \u2026\n*denarian, vicenarian, tricenarian, quadragenarian, quinquagenarian, sexagenarian, septuagenarian, octogenarian, nonagenarian, centenarian, \u2026 millenarian\n\n===Greek series===\n* [[monad (disambiguation)|monad]], [[dyad (disambiguation)|dyad]], [[triad (disambiguation)|triad]], tetrad, [[pentad (disambiguation)|pentad]], hexad, heptad, ogdoad, [[ennead]], decad, ... triacontad, ... hecatontad, [[chiliad]], [[myriad]]\n* [[digon]], trigon, [[tetragon]], [[pentagon]], [[hexagon]], [[heptagon]], [[octagon]], [[enneagon]], [[decagon]], [[hendecagon]], [[dodecagon]], ...
