In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate the girls, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying the student registration fee, this was done with one out of every two student and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) which were taught, and the condition of admission and degree was a test and test success that was held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh.
