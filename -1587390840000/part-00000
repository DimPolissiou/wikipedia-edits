Born in [[Schilpario]] in the [[Republic of Venice]], Grassi studied in [[Bergamo]] and [[Colorno]], where he entered the [[Society of Jesus]]. Because the Society was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed by the pope]], he completed his education at the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]], as the Jesuits were allowed to operate in the [[Russian Empire]]. He proved to be an excellent student of the [[natural science]]s, especially [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]], in which he would later engage in research, and was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the college's [[Institute for Nobles]].\n\nIn 1805, the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] directed Grassi to go to [[Beijing|Peking]] to replace the last remaining [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionary in China]]. This set off for Grassi and two other Jesuits a journey across Europe that would last five years, during which they spent time in London and [[Lisbon]], but never reached China. Grassi ended up teaching and studying at the [[University of Coimbra]], before being transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in England, where he taught for several years and also studied at the [[Royal Institution]].\n\nGrassi was then sent by the General in 1810 to the United States, where he was to teach at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was eventually appointed superior of the [[Jesuits in the United States|Jesuits' Maryland Mission]] and [[List of presidents of Georgetown University|president of the College]] in 1812, where he significantly improved its curriculum, enrollment, and public reputation. Grassi also obtained its [[congressional charter]], which officially recognized the institution as a university. His tenure came to an end in 1817, when Archbishop [[Leonard Neale]] sent him as his representative to the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda Fide]]''.\n\nGrassi never returned to the United States. Rather, he moved to [[Turin]], becoming the rector of the [[Social Institute, Turin|College of Nobles]] for ten years. He also became a close confidant to the monarchs of the [[House of Savoy]], as well as [[provincial superior]] of the Jesuits' Turin Province. In 1835, he was transferred to Rome, where he became rector of the [[Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide|Pontifico Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide]] and later the Superior General's assistant for Italy.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nGiovanni Antonio Grassi was born on 10 September 1775 in [[Schilpario]], [[Lombardy]], in the [[Republic of Venice]]. He studied under the [[Somaschi Fathers]], before going to the diocesan [[seminary]] of [[Bergamo]], where he studied [[Catholic theology|theology]] for two years and was ordained a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]]. Grassi then entered the [[Society of Jesus]], which at the time was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|officially suppressed]] by the [[pope]].<ref name=\"schlafly354\">{{harvnb|Schlafly|2015|p=354}}</ref> He proceeded to the Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[Colorno]], on 21 November 1799,<ref name=garraghan273>{{harvnb|Garraghan|1937|p=273}}</ref> becoming one of the novitiate's first students.<ref name=\"schlafly354\" />\n\n[[File:Po\u0142acak, Jezuicki. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043a, \u0415\u0437\u0443\u0456\u0446\u043a\u0456 (1800) (2).jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]] in 1800|alt=Entrance of the Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]]\n\nDue to the nearly worldwide suppression of the Jesuit order, the novices at Colorno were allowed only to pronounce their [[simple vows]].

Born in [[Schilpario]] in the [[Republic of Venice]], Grassi studied in [[Bergamo]] and [[Colorno]], where he entered the [[Society of Jesus]]. Because the Society was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed by the pope]], he completed his education at the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]], as the Jesuits were allowed to operate in the [[Russian Empire]]. He proved to be an excellent student of the [[natural science]]s, especially [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]], in which he would later engage in research, and was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the college's [[Institute for Nobles]].\n\nIn 1805, the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] directed Grassi to go to [[Beijing|Peking]] to replace the last remaining [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionary in China]]. This set off for Grassi and two other Jesuits a journey across Europe that would last five years, during which they spent time in London and [[Lisbon]], but never reached China. Grassi ended up teaching and studying at the [[University of Coimbra]], before being transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in England, where he taught for several years and also studied at the [[Royal Institution]].\n\nGrassi was then sent by the General in 1810 to the United States, where he was to teach at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was eventually appointed superior of the [[Jesuits in the United States|Jesuits' Maryland Mission]] and [[List of presidents of Georgetown University|president of the College]] in 1812, where he significantly improved its curriculum, enrollment, and public reputation. Grassi also obtained its [[congressional charter]], which officially recognized the institution as a university. His tenure came to an end in 1817, when Archbishop [[Leonard Neale]] sent him as his representative to the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda Fide]]''. \n\nGrassi never returned to the United States. Rather, he moved to [[Turin]], becoming the rector of the [[Social Institute, Turin|College of Nobles]] for ten years. He also became a close confidant to the monarchs of the [[House of Savoy]], as well as [[provincial superior]] of the Jesuits' Turin Province.

His girlfriend, Janine ([[Wendy Moniz]]), a backup singer feels that he never places her as a priority. Mitch is consistently doing six things at once. One evening, while on the telephone with Janine, Mitch flips through tv channels and lands on an edition of [[Nightline]] where he sees Morrie Schwartz ([[Jack Lemmon]]) being interviewed by [[Ted Koppel]]. Morrie discusses his current health and lets everyone know he is dying of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], often referred to as \"[[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]\" or [[ALS]]. Morrie a retired [[sociology]] professor from [[Brandeis University]] comes on the show to describe his final journey.\n\nAs life goes on with work and balancing his relationship with Janine, Mitch feels bothered he never got a chance to visit his old professor. Feeling so moved by the interview, Mitch reaches out for a visit with Morrie after sixteen years of no contact. Morrie has an affinity with food and it becomes a regular endeavor with his visits with Mitch. Office hours during university were on Tuesdays, Morrie would grade papers and critique student\u2019s assignments, Mitch now makes it a habit to visit him every Tuesday. Connie ([[Caroline Aaron]]), Morrie\u2019s home nurse, is his primary care taker.  After leaving Morrie, Mitch continues working and can\u2019t find a groove with Janine.\n\n[[Mitch Albom|Mitch]] returns and witnesses a \u201cliving funeral\u201d where friends and family come to honor [[Morrie Schwartz|Morrie]] while he is still alive, per Morrie\u2019s request. As the two get reacquainted, they participate in several thoughtful and reflective conversations about various substantial topics. Morrie divulges on many stories on when he was a young boy and how his relationships unfolded between his mother, stepmother, and father. Back home Mitch continues with his impressive and busy [[journalism]] career, and while out on a story he receives a call from Janine breaking up with him.\n\nAnother visit prompts Mitch to officially bring a recording device to capture all of Morrie\u2019s powerful pieces of advice and all his anecdotes. Morrie and Mitch grow closer and closer with each visit, some significant topics that were explored were death, love, marriage, family, and relationships. The time spent with Morrie starts to affect Mitch\u2019s position at work, he argues with his boss and decides to prioritize his visits with Morrie. Mitch, being so immersed in this new world asks Connie to teach him a few skills to aide Morrie when no one else is around. New tasks Mitch learn include: helping Morrie in and out of his [[wheelchair]], using his oxygen tank, feeding Morrie, and even special [[Massage|massages]].\n\nFinding value and meaning in Morrie\u2019s advice Mitch proposes to Janine via letter, she rejects him and comes along on one of his visits to Morrie\u2019s home. Janine notices a change in Mitch\u2019s personality in the way he knows what to do around Morrie from the oxygen tank assistance to cleaning Morrie\u2019s crying eyes. Janine and Morrie speak without Mitch in the room. Later, on an airplane on their way home Mitch and Janine make up and decide a proper proposal should take place.\n\nOn a rainy visit, Mitch brings Morrie food, but learns he has not been able to eat solid foods for some time. Charlotte ([[Bonnie Bartlett]]), Morrie\u2019s wife advises Mitch that his visits have a great impact on Morrie. Mitch notices how the illness is progressing in a devastating way. They continue to go back and forth on difficult topics, regret, spiritual life, forgiveness, and love. Morrie reiterates that humans must love another or die. He recounts the story of his father\u2019s death. Mitch receives a call from Walter ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), his boss, after the exchange they found middle ground to allow Mitch to write again. Mitch takes Janine to the islands and propose there. Once back home, Mitch requests to have all of his Tuesdays off to continue his visits with Morrie.\n\nOn a snowy visit, Mitch asks Morrie what a perfect day would be like. Morrie answers a simple answer with friends, family, food, dancing, and choosing his burial site. Morrie asks Mitch to visit once he has passed, breaking his heart. Mitch cries and hugs his old friend. Mitch promises to come back next [[Tuesday]]. Morrie died on a Saturday morning, Janine and Mitch received a call. Charlotte kept his [[funeral]] small, and all the people who\u2019d be in his perfect day would be included. The funeral was held on a Tuesday.<ref>{{Citation|last=luispucela84|title=Tuesdays with Morrie (TV 1999)|date=2013-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E463tZdAGn4|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] \u2013 [[Morrie Schwartz]]\n* [[Hank Azaria]] \u2013 [[Mitch Albom]]\n* [[Wendy Moniz]] \u2013 Janine, Mitch's girlfriend\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] \u2013 Connie, Morrie's home nurse\n* [[Bonnie Bartlett]] \u2013 Charlotte Schwartz, Morrie's wife\n* [[Aaron Lustig]] \u2013 Rabbi Al Axelrod\n* Bruce Nozick \u2013 Mr. Schwartz\n* Ivo Cutzarida \u2013 Armand\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] \u2013 Walter Moran, Mitch's boss from the sports column\n* [[Kyle Sullivan]] \u2013 Young Morrie\n* Dan Thiel \u2013 Shawn Daley\n* [[Christian Meoli]] \u2013 Aldo\n* [[John Billingsley]] \u2013 Sports Fan #1\n\n==Nielsen Ratings==\nThe film brought in a 15.2/22 rating/share, and was watched by 22.5 million viewers, ranking as the most watched program that week.<ref>http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1999/BC-1999-12-13.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-12/08/075r-120899-idx.html</ref> The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] holds a 71% rating where of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Fred Topel from About.com says, \"Movie of the week with film caliber performances\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Common Sense Media Editors states, \"Oprah Winfrey presents a three-hanky weepfest\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> IMDb hold a 7.5/10 rating.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays with Morrie|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805/|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

His girlfriend, Janine ([[Wendy Moniz]]), a backup singer feels that he never places her as a priority. Mitch is consistently doing six things at once. One evening, while on the telephone with Janine, Mitch flips through tv channels and lands on an edition of [[Nightline]] where he sees Morrie Schwartz ([[Jack Lemmon]]) being interviewed by [[Ted Koppel]]. Morrie discusses his current health and lets everyone know he is dying of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], often referred to as \"[[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]\" or [[ALS]]. Morrie a retired [[sociology]] professor from [[Brandeis University]] comes on the show to describe his final journey.\n\nAs life goes on with work and balancing his relationship with Janine, Mitch feels bothered he never got a chance to visit his old professor. Feeling so moved by the interview, Mitch reaches out for a visit with Morrie after sixteen years of no contact. Morrie has an affinity with food and it becomes a regular endeavor with his visits with Mitch. Office hours during university were on Tuesdays, Morrie would grade papers and critique student\u2019s assignments, Mitch now makes it a habit to visit him every Tuesday. Connie ([[Caroline Aaron]]), Morrie\u2019s home nurse, is his primary care taker.  After leaving Morrie, Mitch continues working and can\u2019t find a groove with Janine.\n\n[[Mitch Albom|Mitch]] returns and witnesses a \u201cliving funeral\u201d where friends and family come to honor [[Morrie Schwartz|Morrie]] while he is still alive, per Morrie\u2019s request. As the two get reacquainted, they participate in several thoughtful and reflective conversations about various substantial topics. Morrie divulges on many stories on when he was a young boy and how his relationships unfolded between his mother, stepmother, and father. Back home Mitch continues with his impressive and busy [[journalism]] career, and while out on a story he receives a call from Janine breaking up with him.\n\nAnother visit prompts Mitch to officially bring a recording device to capture all of Morrie\u2019s powerful pieces of advice and all his anecdotes. Morrie and Mitch grow closer and closer with each visit, some significant topics that were explored were death, love, marriage, family, and relationships. The time spent with Morrie starts to affect Mitch\u2019s position at work, he argues with his boss and decides to prioritize his visits with Morrie. Mitch, being so immersed in this new world asks Connie to teach him a few skills to aide Morrie when no one else is around. New tasks Mitch learn include: helping Morrie in and out of his [[wheelchair]], using his oxygen tank, feeding Morrie, and even special [[Massage|massages]].\n\nFinding value and meaning in Morrie\u2019s advice Mitch proposes to Janine via letter, she rejects him and comes along on one of his visits to Morrie\u2019s home. Janine notices a change in Mitch\u2019s personality in the way he knows what to do around Morrie from the oxygen tank assistance to cleaning Morrie\u2019s crying eyes. Janine and Morrie speak without Mitch in the room. Later, on an airplane on their way home Mitch and Janine make up and decide a proper proposal should take place.\n\nOn a rainy visit, Mitch brings Morrie food, but learns he has not been able to eat solid foods for some time. Charlotte ([[Bonnie Bartlett]]), Morrie\u2019s wife advises Mitch that his visits have a great impact on Morrie. Mitch notices how the illness is progressing in a devastating way. They continue to go back and forth on difficult topics, regret, spiritual life, forgiveness, and love. Morrie reiterates that humans must love another or die. He recounts the story of his father\u2019s death. Mitch receives a call from Walter ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), his boss, after the exchange they found middle ground to allow Mitch to write again. Mitch takes Janine to the islands and propose there. Once back home, Mitch requests to have all of his Tuesdays off to continue his visits with Morrie.\n\nOn a snowy visit, Mitch asks Morrie what a perfect day would be like. Morrie answers a simple answer with friends, family, food, dancing, and choosing his burial site. Morrie asks Mitch to visit once he has passed, breaking his heart. Mitch cries and hugs his old friend. Mitch promises to come back next [[Tuesday]]. Morrie died on a Saturday morning, Janine and Mitch received a call. Charlotte kept his [[funeral]] small, and all the people who\u2019d be in his perfect day would be included. The funeral was held on a Tuesday.<ref>{{Citation|last=luispucela84|title=Tuesdays with Morrie (TV 1999)|date=2013-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E463tZdAGn4|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] \u2013 [[Morrie Schwartz]]\n* [[Hank Azaria]] \u2013 [[Mitch Albom]]\n* [[Wendy Moniz]] \u2013 Janine, Mitch's girlfriend\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] \u2013 Connie, Morrie's home nurse\n* [[Bonnie Bartlett]] \u2013 Charlotte Schwartz, Morrie's wife\n* [[Aaron Lustig]] \u2013 Rabbi Al Axelrod\n* Bruce Nozick \u2013 Mr. Schwartz\n* Ivo Cutzarida \u2013 Armand\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] \u2013 Walter Moran, Mitch's boss from the sports column\n* [[Kyle Sullivan]] \u2013 Young Morrie\n* Dan Thiel \u2013 Shawn Daley\n* [[Christian Meoli]] \u2013 Aldo\n* [[John Billingsley]] \u2013 Sports Fan #1\n\n==Nielsen Ratings==\nThe film brought in a 15.2/22 rating/share, and was watched by 22.5 million viewers, ranking as the most watched program that week.<ref>http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1999/BC-1999-12-13.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-12/08/075r-120899-idx.html</ref> The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] holds a 71% rating where of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Fred Topel from About.com says, \"Movie of the week with film caliber performances\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Common Sense Media Editors states, \"Oprah Winfrey presents a three-hanky weepfest\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> IMDb hold a 7.5/10 rating.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays with Morrie|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805/|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

The main purpose in the bible is to know how to worship God. Therefore, Jewish parents needed to teach their children about some basic prayers and what the Torah forbids at their young ages. Parents should have transmitted Jewish morals, faith, and values to their children. The bible's teachings have important impact on Jewish education. Because of this, Jewish education is rooted in the Torah. Nathan H. Winter wrote, \u201cTorah has also been described as that dealing with the whole existence of the human being; that which touches life at every point. Torah also connotes learning, instruction, and guidance. Jewish education was concerned with the transmission of this cultural heritage to the individual Jew.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Jewish Education in a Pluralist Society: Samson Benderly and Jewish Education in the United States|last=Nathan H.

Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead; inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and your gates\u201d (Deut. 6:6-9). Additionally, children are advised to seek the instruction of their parents: \"Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee\" (Deut. 32:7). The [[Book of Proverbs]] also contains many verses related to education: \u201cMy son, do not forget my teaching, but let your mind retain my commandments; For they will bestow on you length of days, years of life and well-being\u201c (Prov. 3:1-2).\n\nElementary school learning was regarded as compulsory by [[Simeon ben Shetah]] as early as 75 BCE and [[Joshua ben Gamla]] in 64 CE. The education of older boys and men in a [[beit midrash]] goes back to the [[Second Temple]] period. The importance of education is stressed in the [[Talmud]], which states that children should begin school at six. The rabbis stated that they should not be beaten with a stick or cane, that older students should help those who were younger, and that children should not be kept from their lessons by other duties.\n\nAccording to Judah ben Tema, \u201cAt five years the age is reached for studying [[Tanakh|Mikra]], at ten for studying the Mishnah, at thirteen for fulfilling the mitzvoth, at fifteen for studying Talmud\u201d (Avot 5:21). Mikra refers to the [[Tanakh|written Torah]], Mishnah refers to the complementary [[oral Torah]] (the concise and precise laws dictating how the written Torah's commandments are achieved) and Talmud refers to comprehension of the oral and written law's unity and contemplation of the laws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mishne Torah|last=Moses ben Maimon|first=Maimonides|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Laws of Torah Study 1:13|location=|pages=|chapter=}}</ref> The term \"Talmud\" used here is a method of study and is not to be confused by the [[Talmud|later compilations]] by the same name. In keeping with this tradition, Jews established their own schools or hired private tutors for their children until the end of the 18th century. Schools were housed in annexes or separate buildings close to the synagogue.\n\n[[Rabbi]] [[Meir Simcha of Dvinsk]] (in his Meshech Chochma) observes that God's statement \"[Abraham is blessed because] he will instruct his children and his house after him to follow in God's ways to perform righteousness and justice\" (Genesis 18:19) is an implicit ''mitzvah'' to teach Judaism.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n== Formal Jewish education ==\n\n=== Sex segregation ===\n[[Sex segregation]] in education has traditionally been the norm. As of 2012, education in the Haredi community was strictly segregated by sex. The education for boys was primarily focused on the study of Jewish scriptures, such as the [[Tanakh|Torah]] and [[Talmud]], while girls obtained studies both in Jewish education as well as broader secular subjects.\n\n=== Primary schooling ===\nThe Talmud (Tractate Bava Bathra 21a) attributes the institution of formal Jewish education to the first century sage [[Joshua ben Gamla]]. Prior to this, parents taught their children informally. Ben Gamla instituted schools in every town and made education compulsory from the age of 6 or 7. The Talmud attaches great importance to the \"''Tinokot shel beth Rabban''\" (the children [who study] at the Rabbi's house), stating that the world continues to exist for their learning and that even for the rebuilding of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]<nowiki/>, classes are not to be interrupted (Tractate Shabbat 119b).\n\n=== The yeshiva ===\nIn [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] and Talmudic times young men were attached to a ''[[beth din]]'' (court of Jewish law), where they sat in three rows and progressed as their fellow students were elevated to sit on the court.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nAfter the formal court system was abolished, ''[[Yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' became the main places for Torah study. The Talmud itself was composed largely in the ''yeshivot'' of [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]] in [[Babylonia]], and the leading sages of the generation taught there. \nUntil the 19th century, young men generally studied under the local [[rabbi]], who was allocated funds by the Jewish community to maintain a number of students. \nThe [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] masters and the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]] both founded centralised ''yeshivot''; see [[Yeshiva #History]].\n\nYeshivot have remained of central importance in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox community]] to this day; see [[Yeshiva #Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas]].  \nPresently, there are numerous yeshivot - particularly in the US and Israel, but in general wherever there is an established an orthodox community. From the early 20th century, [[Hesder]] (Religious Zionist) and [[Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot were also founded. \nIn all of these communities yeshiva study is common,  with young men (and women in a ''[[midrasha]]'') spending several years post high school [[Torah study|studying Torah]]. In the [[Haredi]] and Hasidic communities this study often extends through decades; see [[kollel]]. \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-orthodox streams]] do have yeshivot also, although these are intended (almost entirely) for Rabbinic preparation. Their syllabi similarly depart from the traditional; see [[ Yeshiva #Curriculum]].\n\nIn the 21st century, critics in both the United States and Israel, such as [[Naftuli Moster]], have protested that (some) Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas are teaching religious studies to the exclusion of secular subjects such as mathematics and science. They are promoting the adoption of national or state standards on secular subjects by the yeshivas. Israel's Ministry of Education's statistics from 2014 show that only about 22 percent of Haredi students take matriculation exams, since Orthodox yeshivot mostly ignore core subjects. About 8 percent of Haredi students pass the exam. [[Miriam Ben-Peretz]], professor emeritus of education at the [[University of Haifa]], and winner of the 2006 [[Israel Prize]] notes: \u201cMore and more Israeli students don\u2019t have any foundation of knowledge, any basics \u2014 not in math, not in English, not in general...things have to change.\"Some Israelis who have been educated in Haredi yeshivas have established Leaving for Change (LFC), an organization seeking to sue the government for alleged failure to enforce Israel's law for compulsory education.\n\n=== Jewish schools ===\nThe phenomenon of the [[Jewish day school]] is of relatively common origin. Until the 19th and 20th century, boys attended the ''[[cheder]]'' (literally \"room,\" since it was in the synagogue, which historically was a building with a [[bet midrash]] being the only room) or [[talmud Torah]], where they were taught by a ''[[melamed]] tinokos'' (children's teacher).\n\nThe first Jewish [[day schools]] developed in [[Germany]], largely in response to the higher emphasis in general on secular studies. In the past, an apprenticeship was sufficient to learn a profession, or alternatively several years in a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] could prepare one adequately for [[university]]. Rabbis who pioneered Jewish day schools included [[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimson Raphael Hirsch]], whose ''[[Realschule]]'' in [[Frankfurt am Main]] served as a model for numerous similar institutions. Jews have also been disproportionately engaged in the building of academic institutions of education and in promoting teaching as a professional career. Three of the past four presidents of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] have been Jews: starting with [[Albert Shanker]], her successor [[Sandra Feldman]], all the way to current AFT president, [[Randi Weingarten]].\n\nToday, there are over 750 day schools in the United States and 205,000 students in those schools.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.theicenter.org/sites/default/files/knowledge_base/Recent_Trends_in_Supplementary_Jewish_Education.pdf|title=Recent Trends in Supplementary Jewish Education|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|publisher=The AVI CHAI Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Beyond those students, hundreds of thousands (~250,000) of Jewish children attend supplementary religious, [[Hebrew school|Hebrew]], and congregational schools.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Girls' education ===\n:''See also: [[Hashkafa #Gender roles]]; [[Women in Judaism]]; [[Midrasha]].''\n\nIt was also in the 19th and early 20th century, with the advent of public education for all, that an emphasis was first placed on [[girls' education]]. Before this, particularly in Eastern Europe, girls received their Jewish and Hebrew education at home, and were often illiterate in Hebrew. In the 19th century, public education was made compulsory in most of Europe, and in order to maintain educational control over the Jewish children, Jewish schools became a reality. It was as a result of the initiative of [[Sarah Schenirer]], that the first Jewish girls' [[Bais Yaakov]] school opened in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1918.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.553831|title=The ultra-Orthodox Seamstress Who Determined the Fate of Jewish Women|last=Chizhik-Goldschmidt|first=Avital|date=October 22, 2013|work=Haaretz|access-date=March 7, 2017}}</ref> Girls in the United States at this time were often educated at public schools together with boys, and they received their Jewish education through programs at synagogues and Sunday schools, because Jewish day schools were less common.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4xFlPXSdAAC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Libbie+Suchoff+Berkson&source=bl&ots=VUF0z27Vkp&sig=ecv3WHjNouILtAW379PeYMVjztE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLibTutsDSAhWo34MKHSs2DN4Q6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q=They%20understood%20that%20Jewish%20day%20schools%20were%20not%20an%20option&f=false|title=The Women Who Reconstructed American Jewish Education, 1910-1965|last=Ingall|first=Carol|last2=|publisher=University Press of New England|year=2010|isbn=9781584658559|location=|pages=7|quote=\"They understood that Jewish day schools were not an option, being more appropriate for the Old World and the ghetto.

During the nineteenth century, women could only read Yiddish. Parents should have sent their sons to the primary school, so that their sons could have learned the Hebrew language and the Torah text. Some wealthier parents even employed private tutors for their sons at home. However, some girls in the wealth family may be given the opportunity to learn Jewish vernacular and Hebrew as well. Many girls remained illiterate during the old times. Women stayed home with their family or worked jobs such as maids and seamstresses. After the World War II began, more and more women were used as spies, couriers, nurses, and some even became soldiers. Until the end of World War II, women had transformed into Jewish studies research and teaching in the twenty-first century. The balance of women and men made great strides in equality in Jewish schools.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Jewish Education|last=Miller Helena Grant D.

Many of these are [[Zionist youth movement]]s. The various organizations differ in political ideology, [[Jewish denominations|religious affiliation]], and leadership structure, although they all tend to be characterized by a focus on youth [[leadership]].\n\nThe Conservative movement has USY - [[United Synagogue Youth]]. The Modern Orthodox movement has [[NCSY|NCSY - formerly National Conference of Synagogue Youth]]. [[BBYO]] is a non-denominational group, though most Jews associate it with the Conservative or Reform movements. The [[North American Federation of Temple Youth]], known as NFTY, is the organized youth movement of Reform Judaism in North America. Funded and supported by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]], NFTY exists to supplement and support Reform youth groups at the synagogue level. About 750 local youth groups affiliate themselves with the organization, comprising over 8,500 youth members.\n\n=== Summer camps ===\nJewish summer camps are a tool for creating ties with a particular denomination of Judaism and/or orientation to Israel. Camps are sponsored by the Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform movement, by Jewish community centers, and by Zionist movements such as [[Young Judaea]], [[Betar]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Hashomer Hatzair]] and [[B'nei Akiva]]. Over 70,000 campers participate in over 150 non-profit Jewish [[summer camp]]s, especially in the [[United States]]. In addition, the [[Foundation for Jewish Camp]] estimates that these camps are staffed by over 8,500 Jewish college-aged counselors. American-style Jewish summer camps can also be found in other countries, such as [[Camp Kimama]] in [[Israel]]. Outside the United States, similar camps are generally organized by various philanthropic organizations and local Jewish youth movements.\n\nThe [[Camp Ramah]] network, affiliated with [[Conservative Judaism]] runs camps in North America where youngsters experience traditional ''[[Shabbat]]'' observance, study [[Hebrew]] and observe the laws of [[kashrut]].\n\nThe [[Union for Reform Judaism]] runs the largest Jewish camping system in the world, the URJ Camp & Israel Programs. They operate 13 summer camps across North America, including a sports specialty camp, teen leadership institute and programs for youth with special needs, as well as a number of Israel travel programs. Participants in these programs observe ''[[Shabbat]]'', engage in programming about Jewish values and history, and partake in typical summer camp activities including athletics, creative arts and color war.\n\n=== Student organizations ===\nMuch informal Jewish education is organized on university campuses. This is often supported by national organizations, such as [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] (United States) or the [[UJS|Union of Jewish Students]] (United Kingdom), or by international organizations such as the [[WUJS|World Union of Jewish Students]] and the [[European Union of Jewish Students]].\n\nThe [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] in partnership with The [[Chabad on Campus International Foundation]], manages the Sinai Scholars Society, an integrated fellowship program for college campus students comprising Torah study, social activities, and national networking opportunities.    \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''This section needs expansion'''. <small>You can help by adding to it.</small> <small>''(June 2008)''</small>\n|}\n\n=== Drama-based education ===\nOne of the earliest examples of drama-based Jewish education is the theatrical works of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzatto ([[Ramchal]] 1707-1746, b. Italy), who wrote plays with multiple characters on Jewish themes. While the use of such plays was probably rare in traditional Jewish education, the Etz Chaim school of Jerusalem reportedly staged plays in the 1930s. One such play put [[King David]]'s general [[Joab]] on trial for his various crimes. The students and faculty played the roles of judge, advocates and a jury, all based on extensive Biblical and Talmudic research.\n\nIn more recent times, drama is being further developed as an educational tool [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/education/krug-1.htm <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]. For example, Detroit, MI has an ensemble theater devoted to education and outreach.[http://www.thisisfederation.org/alliance/trg/jet.asp <nowiki>[4]</nowiki>]. Programs such as Jewish Crossroads by Shlomo Horwitz provide educational theater in schools and synagogues in various English-speaking countries [http://jewishcrossroads.org/ <nowiki>[5]</nowiki>]. The Lookstein Center at Bar Ilan, a think tank geared to Jewish educators in the Diaspora, lists many drama-related programs on their website for use of teachers in the classroom [http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/lookstein?q=drama&sa.x=14&sa.y=13 <nowiki>[6]</nowiki>].\n\n=== Sports-based education ===\nSports is another vehicle to connect Jewish youth to Judaism and Israel. Bring It In - Israel offers a sports volunteering program in Israel that cultivates a cadre of young leaders who return to their communities to promote interest in Israel and Judaism. The perceived role of sports as a historical avenue was crucial for Jewish people to overcome social, religious and cultural obstacles toward their participation in secular society (especially in Europe and the United States).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.infed.org/informaljewisheducation/jewish_youth_movements.htm The World of the Jewish Youth Movement]'' by Daniel Rose - on movements and informal education\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.aju.edu/ American Jewish University]\n* [http://www.newcaje.org/ NewCAJE: Re-Imaging Jewish Education for the 21st Century]\n* [http://www.lookstein.org/ The Lookstein Center for Jewish Education]\n* [https://www.refusenikproject.org// The Refusenik Project is a free educational resource created by The Lookstein Center of Bar-Ilan University to keep the story of Soviet Jewry alive and to inspire the next generation with its message\n* [https://sovietjewry.wixsite.com/giveaway/ 'Grants for Educators who teach about Soviet Jewry Struggle''\n* [http://hartman.org.il/ Shalom Hartman Institute]\n* [http://www.jewishteacher.org/ The Jewish Teacher Project]\n* [http://www.jewishedproject.org/ The Jewish Education Project]\n \n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jewish Education}}\n[[Category:Jewish education| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish summer camps|*]]\n[[Category:Jewish youth organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Chinuch|the book|Sefer ha-Chinuch}}\n[[File:Pale teacher.jpg|thumb|260px|A Jewish father teaching a child in 19th-century [[Podolia]].]]\n{{Judaism|culture}}\n\n'''Jewish education''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05da}}, ''Chinukh'') is the transmission of the tenets, principles and religious laws of [[Judaism]].

The Talmud itself was composed largely in the ''yeshivot'' of [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]] in [[Babylonia]], and the leading sages of the generation taught there. \nUntil the 19th century, young men generally studied under the local [[rabbi]], who was allocated funds by the Jewish community to maintain a number of students. \nThe [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] masters and the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]] both founded centralised ''yeshivot''; see [[Yeshiva #History]].\n\nYeshivot have remained of central importance in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox community]] to this day; see [[Yeshiva #Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas]].  \nPresently, there are numerous yeshivot - particularly in the US and Israel, but in general wherever there is an established an orthodox community. From the early 20th century, [[Hesder]] (Religious Zionist) and [[Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot were also founded. \nIn all of these communities yeshiva study is common,  with young men (and women in a ''[[midrasha]]'') spending several years post high school [[Torah study|studying Torah]]. In the [[Haredi]] and Hasidic communities this study often extends through decades; see [[kollel]]. \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-orthodox streams]] do have yeshivot also, although these are intended (almost entirely) for Rabbinic preparation. Their syllabi similarly depart from the traditional; see [[ Yeshiva #Curriculum]].\n\nIn the 21st century, critics in both the United States and Israel, such as [[Naftuli Moster]], have protested that (some) Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas are teaching religious studies to the exclusion of secular subjects such as mathematics and science. They are promoting the adoption of national or state standards on secular subjects by the yeshivas. Israel's Ministry of Education's statistics from 2014 show that only about 22 percent of Haredi students take matriculation exams, since Orthodox yeshivot mostly ignore core subjects. About 8 percent of Haredi students pass the exam. [[Miriam Ben-Peretz]], professor emeritus of education at the [[University of Haifa]], and winner of the 2006 [[Israel Prize]] notes: \u201cMore and more Israeli students don\u2019t have any foundation of knowledge, any basics \u2014 not in math, not in English, not in general...things have to change.\"Some Israelis who have been educated in Haredi yeshivas have established Leaving for Change (LFC), an organization seeking to sue the government for alleged failure to enforce Israel's law for compulsory education.\n\n=== Jewish schools ===\nThe phenomenon of the [[Jewish day school]] is of relatively common origin. Until the 19th and 20th century, boys attended the ''[[cheder]]'' (literally \"room,\" since it was in the synagogue, which historically was a building with a [[bet midrash]] being the only room) or [[talmud Torah]], where they were taught by a ''[[melamed]] tinokos'' (children's teacher).\n\nThe first Jewish [[day schools]] developed in [[Germany]], largely in response to the higher emphasis in general on secular studies. In the past, an apprenticeship was sufficient to learn a profession, or alternatively several years in a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] could prepare one adequately for [[university]]. Rabbis who pioneered Jewish day schools included [[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimson Raphael Hirsch]], whose ''[[Realschule]]'' in [[Frankfurt am Main]] served as a model for numerous similar institutions. Jews have also been disproportionately engaged in the building of academic institutions of education and in promoting teaching as a professional career. Three of the past four presidents of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] have been Jews: starting with [[Albert Shanker]], her successor [[Sandra Feldman]], all the way to current AFT president, [[Randi Weingarten]].\n\nToday, there are over 750 day schools in the United States and 205,000 students in those schools.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.theicenter.org/sites/default/files/knowledge_base/Recent_Trends_in_Supplementary_Jewish_Education.pdf|title=Recent Trends in Supplementary Jewish Education|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|publisher=The AVI CHAI Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Beyond those students, hundreds of thousands (~250,000) of Jewish children attend supplementary religious, [[Hebrew school|Hebrew]], and congregational schools.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Girls' education ===\nIt was also in the 19th and early 20th century, with the advent of public education for all, that an emphasis was first placed on [[girls' education]]. Before this, particularly in Eastern Europe, girls received their Jewish and Hebrew education at home, and were often illiterate in Hebrew. In the 19th century, public education was made compulsory in most of Europe, and in order to maintain educational control over the Jewish children, Jewish schools became a reality. It was as a result of the initiative of [[Sarah Schenirer]], that the first Jewish girls' [[Bais Yaakov]] school opened in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1918.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.553831|title=The ultra-Orthodox Seamstress Who Determined the Fate of Jewish Women|last=Chizhik-Goldschmidt|first=Avital|date=October 22, 2013|work=Haaretz|access-date=March 7, 2017}}</ref> Girls in the United States at this time were often educated at public schools together with boys, and they received their Jewish education through programs at synagogues and Sunday schools, because Jewish day schools were less common.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4xFlPXSdAAC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Libbie+Suchoff+Berkson&source=bl&ots=VUF0z27Vkp&sig=ecv3WHjNouILtAW379PeYMVjztE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLibTutsDSAhWo34MKHSs2DN4Q6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q=They%20understood%20that%20Jewish%20day%20schools%20were%20not%20an%20option&f=false|title=The Women Who Reconstructed American Jewish Education, 1910-1965|last=Ingall|first=Carol|last2=|publisher=University Press of New England|year=2010|isbn=9781584658559|location=|pages=7|quote=\"They understood that Jewish day schools were not an option, being more appropriate for the Old World and the ghetto.

During the nineteenth century, women could only read Yiddish. Parents should have sent their sons to the primary school, so that their sons could have learned the Hebrew language and the Torah text. Some wealthier parents even employed private tutors for their sons at home. However, some girls in the wealth family may be given the opportunity to learn Jewish vernacular and Hebrew as well. Many girls remained illiterate during the old times. Women stayed home with their family or worked jobs such as maids and seamstresses. After the World War II began, more and more women were used as spies, couriers, nurses, and some even became soldiers. Until the end of World War II, women had transformed into Jewish studies research and teaching in the twenty-first century. The balance of women and men made great strides in equality in Jewish schools.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Jewish Education|last=Miller Helena Grant D. Lisa Pomson Alex|first=|publisher=Springer; 2011 edition|date=April 25, 2011|isbn=978-9400703537|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Informal Jewish education ==\n\n=== Youth groups ===\nRecent<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Chronological items|when?]]'']</sup> studies estimate a population of 650,000 Jewish middle and high school students.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Link rot|dead link]]'']</sup> Most of these attend Jewish youth groups or participate in activities funded by Jewish youth organizations [[List of Jewish youth organizations|Jewish youth organizations]]. Many of these are [[Zionist youth movement]]s. The various organizations differ in political ideology, [[Jewish denominations|religious affiliation]], and leadership structure, although they all tend to be characterized by a focus on youth [[leadership]].\n\nThe Conservative movement has USY - [[United Synagogue Youth]]. The Modern Orthodox movement has [[NCSY|NCSY - formerly National Conference of Synagogue Youth]]. [[BBYO]] is a non-denominational group, though most Jews associate it with the Conservative or Reform movements. The [[North American Federation of Temple Youth]], known as NFTY, is the organized youth movement of Reform Judaism in North America. Funded and supported by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]], NFTY exists to supplement and support Reform youth groups at the synagogue level. About 750 local youth groups affiliate themselves with the organization, comprising over 8,500 youth members.\n\n=== Summer camps ===\nJewish summer camps are a tool for creating ties with a particular denomination of Judaism and/or orientation to Israel. Camps are sponsored by the Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform movement, by Jewish community centers, and by Zionist movements such as [[Young Judaea]], [[Betar]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Hashomer Hatzair]] and [[B'nei Akiva]]. Over 70,000 campers participate in over 150 non-profit Jewish [[summer camp]]s, especially in the [[United States]]. In addition, the [[Foundation for Jewish Camp]] estimates that these camps are staffed by over 8,500 Jewish college-aged counselors. American-style Jewish summer camps can also be found in other countries, such as [[Camp Kimama]] in [[Israel]]. Outside the United States, similar camps are generally organized by various philanthropic organizations and local Jewish youth movements.\n\nThe [[Camp Ramah]] network, affiliated with [[Conservative Judaism]] runs camps in North America where youngsters experience traditional ''[[Shabbat]]'' observance, study [[Hebrew]] and observe the laws of [[kashrut]].\n\nThe [[Union for Reform Judaism]] runs the largest Jewish camping system in the world, the URJ Camp & Israel Programs. They operate 13 summer camps across North America, including a sports specialty camp, teen leadership institute and programs for youth with special needs, as well as a number of Israel travel programs. Participants in these programs observe ''[[Shabbat]]'', engage in programming about Jewish values and history, and partake in typical summer camp activities including athletics, creative arts and color war.\n\n=== Student organizations ===\nMuch informal Jewish education is organized on university campuses. This is often supported by national organizations, such as [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] (United States) or the [[UJS|Union of Jewish Students]] (United Kingdom), or by international organizations such as the [[WUJS|World Union of Jewish Students]] and the [[European Union of Jewish Students]].\n\nThe [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] in partnership with The [[Chabad on Campus International Foundation]], manages the Sinai Scholars Society, an integrated fellowship program for college campus students comprising Torah study, social activities, and national networking opportunities.    \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''This section needs expansion'''. <small>You can help by adding to it.</small> <small>''(June 2008)''</small>\n|}\n\n=== Drama-based education ===\nOne of the earliest examples of drama-based Jewish education is the theatrical works of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzatto ([[Ramchal]] 1707-1746, b. Italy), who wrote plays with multiple characters on Jewish themes. While the use of such plays was probably rare in traditional Jewish education, the Etz Chaim school of Jerusalem reportedly staged plays in the 1930s. One such play put [[King David]]'s general [[Joab]] on trial for his various crimes. The students and faculty played the roles of judge, advocates and a jury, all based on extensive Biblical and Talmudic research.\n\nIn more recent times, drama is being further developed as an educational tool [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/education/krug-1.htm <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]. For example, Detroit, MI has an ensemble theater devoted to education and outreach.[http://www.thisisfederation.org/alliance/trg/jet.asp <nowiki>[4]</nowiki>]. Programs such as Jewish Crossroads by Shlomo Horwitz provide educational theater in schools and synagogues in various English-speaking countries [http://jewishcrossroads.org/ <nowiki>[5]</nowiki>]. The Lookstein Center at Bar Ilan, a think tank geared to Jewish educators in the Diaspora, lists many drama-related programs on their website for use of teachers in the classroom [http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/lookstein?q=drama&sa.x=14&sa.y=13 <nowiki>[6]</nowiki>].\n\n=== Sports-based education ===\nSports is another vehicle to connect Jewish youth to Judaism and Israel. Bring It In - Israel offers a sports volunteering program in Israel that cultivates a cadre of young leaders who return to their communities to promote interest in Israel and Judaism. The perceived role of sports as a historical avenue was crucial for Jewish people to overcome social, religious and cultural obstacles toward their participation in secular society (especially in Europe and the United States).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.infed.org/informaljewisheducation/jewish_youth_movements.htm The World of the Jewish Youth Movement]'' by Daniel Rose - on movements and informal education\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.aju.edu/ American Jewish University]\n* [http://www.newcaje.org/ NewCAJE: Re-Imaging Jewish Education for the 21st Century]\n* [http://www.lookstein.org/ The Lookstein Center for Jewish Education]\n* [https://www.refusenikproject.org// The Refusenik Project is a free educational resource created by The Lookstein Center of Bar-Ilan University to keep the story of Soviet Jewry alive and to inspire the next generation with its message\n* [https://sovietjewry.wixsite.com/giveaway/ 'Grants for Educators who teach about Soviet Jewry Struggle''\n* [http://hartman.org.il/ Shalom Hartman Institute]\n* [http://www.jewishteacher.org/ The Jewish Teacher Project]\n* [http://www.jewishedproject.org/ The Jewish Education Project]\n \n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jewish Education}}\n[[Category:Jewish education| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish summer camps|*]]\n[[Category:Jewish youth organizations]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGirls' education", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_education"}
