Their goal was to win the support of the Allied Powers for the independence of [[Bohemian Crown|Bohemia]] and [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]] from the [[Cisleithania|Austrian Empire]] and of [[Slovakia|Slovak]] territories from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which were then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. With the help of \u00e9migr\u00e9 intellectuals and politicians such as the Czech [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] and the Slovak [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik]], they grew into a force of over 100,000 strong.\n\nIn [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], they took part in several victorious battles of the war, including the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Zborov]] and [[Battle of Bakhmach|Bakhmach]] against the [[Central Powers]], and were heavily involved in the [[Russian Civil War]] fighting Bolsheviks, at times controlling the entire [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and several major cities in Siberia.\n\nAfter three years of existence as a small unit in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], the Legion in Russia was established in 1917, with other troops fighting in [[French Third Republic|France]] since the beginning of the war as the \"Nazdar\" company, and similar units later emerging in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Originally an all-volunteer force, these formations were later strengthened by Czech and Slovak prisoners of war or deserters from the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. The majority of the legionaries were Czechs, with Slovaks making up 7% of the force in Russia, 3% in Italy and 16% in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cesi-bojovali-hrdinne-za-rakousko-uhersko-ale-prvni-republika-to-tutlala-1qb-/kavarna.asp?c=A081026_232405_kavarna_sim|title=\u010ce\u0161i bojovali hrdinn\u011b za Rakousko-Uhersko, ale prvn\u00ed republika to tutlala|publisher=zpravy.idnes.cz|accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Czechoslovak Legion'' preceded and anticipated the creation of a country called ''[[Czechoslovakia]]''.\n\n==Legion in Russia==\n===Activity in World War I, 1914\u20131917===\n[[File:Memorial of the Czechoslovak Legion in Battle of Zborov, 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial for the dead of the Czechoslovak Legion in the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|battle of Zborov]] (1917) at the [[Kalinivka]] cemetery, Ukraine]]\n\nAs World War I broke out, national societies representing ethnic Czechs and Slovaks residing in the [[Russian Empire]] petitioned the Russian government to support the independence of their homelands. To prove their loyalty to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] cause, these groups advocated the establishment of a unit of Czech and Slovak volunteers to fight alongside the Russian Army.<ref>John Bradley, ''The Czechoslovak Legion in Russia 1914\u20131920'' (Boulder: East European Monographs, 1990) 14\u201316.</ref>\n\n[[File:Blansko Zborovak.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to the Czechoslovaks in the battle of Zborov at [[Blansko]], Czech Republic.]]\n[[File:Battle of Bachmac memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|A memorial plaque to the [[Battle of Bakhmach]] in Olomouc]]\n\nOn 5 August 1914, the Russian [[Stavka]] authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. This unit, called the \"Czech Companions\" (''\u010cesk\u00e1 dru\u017eina'' or ''Dru\u017eina''), went to the front in October 1914, where it was attached to the Russian Third Army.<ref>Josef Kalvoda, ''The Genesis of Czechoslovakia'' (Boulder: East European Monographs, 1986) 62\u201363.</ref>  There the ''Dru\u017eina'' soldiers served in scattered patrols performing a number of specialized duties, including reconnaissance, prisoner interrogation and subversion of enemy troops in the opposite trenches.<ref>Bradley, ''Czechoslovak Legion'', 41.</ref>\n\nFrom its start, Czech and Slovak political \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Russia and Western Europe desired to expand the ''Dru\u017eina'' from a battalion into a formidable military formation. To achieve this goal, however, they recognized that they would need to recruit from Czech and Slovak [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the ''Dru\u017eina'' to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this order was rescinded after only a few weeks due to opposition from other branches of the Russian government. Despite continuous efforts of \u00e9migr\u00e9 leaders to persuade the Russian authorities to change their mind, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917. Still, some Czechs and Slovaks were able to sidestep this ban by enlisting POWs through local agreements with Russian military authorities.<ref>Brent Mueggenberg, ''The Czecho-Slovak Struggle for Independence 1914\u20131920'' (Jefferson: McFarland, 2014) 67\u201370.</ref>\n\nUnder these conditions, the Czechoslovak unit in Russia grew very slowly from 1914\u20131917. In early 1916, the ''Dru\u017eina'' was reorganized as the 1st Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. During that year, two more infantry regiments were added, creating the Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade (''\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 st\u0159eleck\u00e1 brig\u00e1da''). This unit distinguished itself during the [[Kerensky Offensive]] in July 1917, when the Czecho-Slovak troops overran Austrian trenches during the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]].<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 86\u201390.</ref>\n\nFollowing the soldiers' stellar performance at Zborov, the [[Russian Provisional Government]] finally granted their \u00e9migr\u00e9 leaders on the [[Czechoslovak National Council]] permission to mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer, a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (''\u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd sbor na Rusi''), also known as the Czechoslovak Legion (''\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 legie'') in Russia. A second division, consisting of four regiments, was added to the Legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 troops by 1918.<ref>Kalvoda, ''Genesis'', 101\u2013105.</ref>\n\n===Evacuation from Bolshevik Russia===\n{{main|Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion}}\nIn November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power throughout Russia and soon began peace negotiations with the [[Central Powers]] at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]]. The chairman of the Czechoslovak National Council, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, who had arrived in Russia earlier that year, began planning for the Legion's departure from Russia and transfer to [[France]] so the Czechoslovaks could continue to fight against the Central Powers. Since most of Russia's main ports were blockaded, Masaryk decided that the Legion should travel from Ukraine to the Pacific port of [[Vladivostok]], where the men would embark on transport vessels that would carry them to Western Europe.<ref>Victor M. Fic, ''Revolutionary War and the Russian Question'' (New Delhi: Abhinav, 1977) 36\u201339.</ref>\n\n[[File:Russian civil war in the west.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Troop movements in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The dark grey lines show the maximum advance of the White forces, including the Czechoslovaks.]]\n\nIn February 1918, Bolshevik authorities in Ukraine granted Masaryk and his troops permission to begin the {{convert|6000|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} journey to Vladivostok.<ref>Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, ''The Making of a State'', Translated by Henry Wickham Steed (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1927) 177.</ref>  However, on 18 February, before the Czechoslovaks had left Ukraine, the German Army launched [[Operation Faustschlag|Operation ''Faustschlag'']] (fist strike) on the Eastern Front to force the Soviet government to accept its terms for peace. From 5 to 13 March, the Czechoslovak legionaries successfully fought off German attempts to prevent their evacuation in the [[Battle of Bakhmach]].<ref>Henry Baerlein, ''The March of the Seventy Thousand'' (London: Leonard Parsons, 1926) 101\u2013103, 128\u2013129.</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Ukraine and entering [[Soviet Russia]], representatives of the Czechoslovak National Council continued to negotiate with Bolshevik authorities in Moscow and [[Penza]] to iron out the details of the corps' evacuation. On 25 March, the two sides signed the Penza Agreement, in which the legionaries were to surrender most of their weapons in exchange for unmolested passage to Vladivostok. Tensions continued to mount, however, as each side distrusted the other. The Bolsheviks, despite Masaryk's order for the legionaries to remain neutral in Russia's affairs, suspected that the Czechoslovaks might join their counterrevolutionary enemies in the borderlands. Meanwhile, the legionaries were wary of [[Czechoslovak Communist Party in Russia|Czechoslovak Communists]] who were trying to subvert the corps. They also suspected that the Bolsheviks were being pressured by the Central Powers to stall their movement towards Vladivostok.<ref>Victor M. Fic, ''The Bolsheviks and the Czechoslovak Legion'' (New Delhi: Abhinav, 1978) 22\u201338.</ref>\n\nBy May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion was strung out along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] from Penza to Vladivostok. Their evacuation was proving much slower than expected due to dilapidated railway conditions, a shortage of locomotives and the recurring need to negotiate with local soviets along the route. On 14 May, a dispute at the [[Chelyabinsk]] station between legionaries heading east and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] POWs heading west to be repatriated caused the People's Commissar for War, [[Leon Trotsky]], to order the complete disarmament and arrest of the legionaries. At an army congress that convened in Chelyabinsk a few days later, the Czechoslovaks \u2013 against the wishes of the National Council \u2013 refused to disarm and began issuing ultimatums for their passage to Vladivostok.<ref>Fic, ''Bolsheviks'', 230\u2013261.</ref>  This incident sparked the [[Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion|Revolt of the Legions]].\n\n[[File:Czechoslovaks victims of Bolshveki near Vladivostok.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia killed by bolsheviks at [[Nikolsk-Ussuriysky]], 1918.

By June, the two sides were fighting along the railway route from Penza to [[Krasnoyarsk]]. By the end of the month, legionaries under General [[Mikhail Diterikhs]] had taken control of Vladivostok, overthrowing the local Bolshevik administration. On July 6, the Legion declared the city to be an Allied protectorate,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/czech-troops-take-russian-port-of-vladivostok-for-allies|title=Czech troops take Russian port of Vladivostok for Allies \u2013 Jul 6, 1918|website=History.com|access-date=2016-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226035749/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/czech-troops-take-russian-port-of-vladivostok-for-allies|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and legionnaires began returning across the Trans-Siberian Railway to support their comrades fighting to their west. Generally, the Czechoslovaks were the victors in their early engagements against the fledgling [[Red Army]].\n\nBy mid-July, the legionaries had seized control of the railway from [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] to [[Irkutsk]], and by the beginning of September they had cleared Bolshevik forces from the entire length of the Trans-Siberian Railway.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 161\u2013177, 188\u2013191.</ref> Legionnaires conquered all the large cities of Siberia, including [[Yekaterinburg]], but Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family were executed on the direct orders of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] less than a week before the arrival of the Legion.\n\n===Involvement in the Russian Civil War, 1918\u20131919===\n[[File:Bronepoezd Orlik.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovaks with [[List of armoured trains#Russia|armored train \"Orl\u00edk\"]], Russia]]\n\nNews of the Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia during the summer of 1918 was welcomed by Allied statesmen in Great Britain and France, who saw the operation as a means to reconstitute an eastern front against Germany.<ref>George Kennan, ''Soviet-American Relations: The Decision to Intervene'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1958) 357\u2013358, 382\u2013384.</ref>  U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who had resisted earlier Allied proposals to intervene in Russia, gave in to domestic and foreign pressure to support the legionaries' evacuation from Siberia. In early July 1918, he published an [[aide-m\u00e9moire]] calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak troops, who were then blocked by Bolshevik forces in [[Transbaikal]].<ref>Kennan, ''Decision to Intervene'', 395\u2013408.</ref>  But by the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, the Czechoslovaks were already there to welcome them. The Allied intervention in Siberia continued so that by autumn 1918, there were 70,000 Japanese, 829 British, 1,400 Italian, 5,002 American and 107 French colonial (Vietnamese) troops in the region. Many of these contingents supported [[White movement|anti-Bolshevik Russians]] and [[Cossack]] warlords who had established regional governments in the wake of the Czechoslovak seizure of the Trans-Siberian Railway.<ref>Benjamin Isitt, ''From Victoria to Vladivostok: Canada's Siberian Expedition, 1917\u201319'' (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press).</ref>\n\nThe Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia impressed Allied statesmen and attracted them to the idea of an independent Czechoslovak state. As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another that summer, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 185\u2013188.</ref>\n\n===Capture of Imperial Gold Reserve===\nShortly after they entered into hostilities against the Bolsheviks, the legionaries began making common cause with anti-Bolshevik, or White, Russians who began forming their own governments behind the Czechoslovaks' lines. The most important of these governments were the [[Komuch]] in Samara and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] in [[Omsk]]. With substantial Czechoslovak help, the [[People's Army of Komuch]] won several important victories, including the capture of [[Kazan]] and an Imperial state gold reserve on 5 August 1918. Czechoslovak pressure was also crucial in convincing the White Russians in Siberia to nominally unify behind the [[Provisional All-Russian Government|All-Russian Provisional Government]], formed at a conference in [[Ufa]] during September 1918.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''A People's Tragedy'' (New York: Viking, 1997) 580\u2013581.</ref>\n\n[[File:Banner of the First Assault Battalion of the Czechoslovak Legions (Reverse).svg|thumb|Banner of the First Assault Battalion of Czechoslovak Legions adopted on 2 February 1919 in [[Yekaterinburg]]]]\n\nDuring the autumn of 1918, the legionaries' enthusiasm for the fighting in Russia, then mostly confined along the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], dropped precipitously.

On 28 October, [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak statehood]] was declared in [[Prague]], arousing the troops with a desire to return to their homeland. The final blow to Czechoslovak morale arrived on 18 November 1918, when a coup in Omsk overthrew the All-Russian Provisional Government and installed a dictatorship under Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] in control of White Siberia.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 215\u2013225.</ref>\n\nDuring the winter of 1918\u20131919, the Czechoslovak troops were redeployed from the front to guard the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway between [[Novonikolaevsk]] and Irkutsk from [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] attacks. Alongside other legions formed from [[Polish 5th Rifle Division|Polish]], [[Romanian Volunteer Corps in Russia|Romanian]] and Yugoslav POWs in Siberia, the Czechoslovaks defended the Kolchak government's only supply route for the duration of 1919.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 249.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1919, [[Siberian Army|Kolchak's armies]] were in a steady retreat from the Red Eastern Army Group. On 14 November, the Reds took Omsk, Kolchak's capital, initiating a desperate [[Great Siberian Ice March|eastward flight]] by the White army and refugees along the Trans-Siberian Railway. In the following weeks, the Whites' rear was further disorganized by widespread outbreaks of uprisings and partisan activity. The homesick legionaries, who simply wanted to leave Siberia without incurring any more casualties than necessary, declared their neutrality amid the unrest and did nothing to suppress the rebellions. Meanwhile, Kolchak's trains, which included the gold bullion captured from Kazan, were stranded along the railway near [[Nizhneudinsk]]. After his bodyguard deserted him there, the legionaries were ordered by Allied representatives in Siberia to safely escort the admiral to Vladivostok. This plan was resisted by insurgents along the Czechoslovaks' route, and as a result the legionaries, after consulting their commanders, Generals [[Maurice Janin|Janin]] and [[Jan Syrov\u00fd]], made the controversial decision to turn Kolchak over to the Political Center, a government formed by [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialists-Revolutionaries]] in Irkutsk. On 7 February 1920, the legionaries had signed an armistice with the Fifth Red Army at Kutin, whereby the latter allowed the Czechoslovaks unmolested passage to Vladivostok. In exchange, the legionaries agreed to not try to rescue Kolchak and to leave the remaining gold bullion with the authorities in Irkutsk. Earlier that day, Kolchak had been executed by a [[Cheka]] firing squad to prevent his rescue by a small White army then on the outskirts of the city.<ref>Jonathon Smele, ''Civil War in Siberia'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996) 544\u2013665.</ref>\n\n===Evacuation from Vladivostok, 1920===\nWhen the armistice with the Bolsheviks was concluded, dozens of Czechoslovak trains were still west of Irkutsk. On 1 March 1920, the last Czechoslovak train passed through that city. The legionaries' progress was still hampered at times by the Japanese Expeditionary Force and the troops of [[Ataman]] [[Ataman Semenov|Grigori Semenov]], who stalled the Czechoslovak trains to delay the arrival of the Red Army in Eastern Siberia. By then, however, the evacuation of Czechoslovak troops from Vladivostok was well underway, and the last legionaries left the port in September 1920. The total number of people evacuated with the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia was 67,739;{{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=The numbers don't match up: 67,739 vs. 70,739 when you add the numbers up}} including 56,455 soldiers, 3,004 officers, 6,714 civilians, 1,716 wives, 717 children, 1,935 foreigners and 198 others.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bradley, ''Czechoslovak Legion'', 156.</ref>  After their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new [[Czechoslovak Army]].\n\nThe number of legionaries killed in Russia during World War I and the Russian Civil War amounted to 4,112.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  An unknown number went missing or deserted the legion, either to make an arduous journey to return home or to join the Czechoslovak Communists.<ref>Joan McGuire Mohr, ''The Czech and Slovak Legion in Siberia 1917\u20131922'' (Jefferson: McFarland, 2012) 157.</ref>  Among the latter was [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]], later the author of the satirical novel ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]''.\n\n==Legion in France==\n{{main|Czechoslovak Legion in France}}\n[[File:Tcheco-slovaques a la caserne de Reuilly.PNG|thumb|Czechoslovak Legions in France]]\n\nIn France, the Czechs and Slovaks who wanted to fight [[Austria-Hungary]] were allowed to join the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] (hence originated the term ''Legion'' for units of Czechoslovak volunteers). In 31 August 1914, the 1st [[company (military unit)|Company]] of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Foreign Legion in [[Bayonne]] was created mostly of the Czechs and was nicknamed \"''rota Nazdar''\" (\"Nazdar!\" Company). The company distinguished itself in heavy combat during assaults near [[Arras]] on May 9 and June 16, 1915. Because of heavy casualties, the Company was disbanded, and volunteers continued to fight in various French units.\n\nNew autonomous Czechoslovak units were established by the decree of the French government in 19 December 1917. In January 1918, the 21st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was formed in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]]; it mixed prisoners of war with volunteers living in America. The 22nd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was created later in May.\n\n==Legion in Italy==\n{{main|Czechoslovak Legion in Italy}}\n[[File:\u010cs. legie v It\u00e1lii.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovak Legions in Italy]]\n\nThe creation of Czechoslovak units in Italy took place much later than in France or in Russia. In January 1918, the commander of 6th Italian Army decided to form small reconnaissance groups from Czech, Slovak and Southern Slav volunteers from [[POW camp]]s. They also served in propaganda actions against Austrian army. In September 1918, first fighting unit, the 39th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Italian Legion was formed of those volunteer reconnaissance squadrons.\n\nItalian legionaries were the first who returned to newly created [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1918 and were immediately drafted into fights for new state borders. Most notably in the war against [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].\n\n==After the war==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Darney, pam\u00e1tn\u00edk, legion\u00e1\u0159i.JPG|thumb|Remembrance Ceremony at the memorial of 30 June 2013 with the unit in uniforms of CS legionnaires in France]]\n[[File:Bank of the Czechoslovak Legions, Prague.jpg|thumb|left|The fa\u00e7ade of the Legiobanka main office in Prague is decorated with reliefs of war scenes.]]\n\nMembers of the legions formed a significant part of the new Czechoslovak Army.

Their goal was to win the support of the Allied Powers for the independence of [[Bohemian Crown|Bohemia]] and [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]] from the [[Cisleithania|Austrian Empire]] and of [[Slovakia|Slovak]] territories from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which were then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. With the help of \u00e9migr\u00e9 intellectuals and politicians such as the Czech [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] and the Slovak [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik]], they grew into a force of over 100,000 strong.\n\nIn [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], they took part in several victorious battles of the war, including the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Zborov]] and [[Battle of Bakhmach|Bakhmach]] against the [[Central Powers]], and were heavily involved in the [[Russian Civil War]] fighting Bolsheviks, at times controlling the entire [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and several major cities in Siberia.\n\nAfter three years of existence as a small unit in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], the Legion in Russia was established in 1917, with other troops fighting in [[French Third Republic|France]] since the beginning of the war as the \"Nazdar\" company, and similar units later emerging in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Originally an all-volunteer force, these formations were later strengthened by Czech and Slovak prisoners of war or deserters from the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. The majority of the legionaries were Czechs, with Slovaks making up 7% of the force in Russia, 3% in Italy and 16% in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cesi-bojovali-hrdinne-za-rakousko-uhersko-ale-prvni-republika-to-tutlala-1qb-/kavarna.asp?c=A081026_232405_kavarna_sim|title=\u010ce\u0161i bojovali hrdinn\u011b za Rakousko-Uhersko, ale prvn\u00ed republika to tutlala|publisher=zpravy.idnes.cz|accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Czechoslovak Legion'' preceded and anticipated the creation of a country called ''[[Czechoslovakia]]''. \n\n==Legion in Russia==\n===Activity in World War I, 1914\u20131917===\n[[File:Memorial of the Czechoslovak Legion in Battle of Zborov, 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial for the dead of the Czechoslovak Legion in the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|battle of Zborov]] (1917) at the [[Kalinivka]] cemetery, Ukraine]]\n\nAs World War I broke out, national societies representing ethnic Czechs and Slovaks residing in the [[Russian Empire]] petitioned the Russian government to support the independence of their homelands. To prove their loyalty to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] cause, these groups advocated the establishment of a unit of Czech and Slovak volunteers to fight alongside the Russian Army.<ref>John Bradley, ''The Czechoslovak Legion in Russia 1914\u20131920'' (Boulder: East European Monographs, 1990) 14\u201316.</ref>\n\n[[File:Blansko Zborovak.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to the Czechoslovaks in the battle of Zborov at [[Blansko]], Czech Republic.]]\n[[File:Battle of Bachmac memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|A memorial plaque to the [[Battle of Bakhmach]] in Olomouc]]\n\nOn 5 August 1914, the Russian [[Stavka]] authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. This unit, called the \"Czech Companions\" (''\u010cesk\u00e1 dru\u017eina'' or ''Dru\u017eina''), went to the front in October 1914, where it was attached to the Russian Third Army.<ref>Josef Kalvoda, ''The Genesis of Czechoslovakia'' (Boulder: East European Monographs, 1986) 62\u201363.</ref>  There the ''Dru\u017eina'' soldiers served in scattered patrols performing a number of specialized duties, including reconnaissance, prisoner interrogation and subversion of enemy troops in the opposite trenches.<ref>Bradley, ''Czechoslovak Legion'', 41.</ref>\n\nFrom its start, Czech and Slovak political \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Russia and Western Europe desired to expand the ''Dru\u017eina'' from a battalion into a formidable military formation. To achieve this goal, however, they recognized that they would need to recruit from Czech and Slovak [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the ''Dru\u017eina'' to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this order was rescinded after only a few weeks due to opposition from other branches of the Russian government. Despite continuous efforts of \u00e9migr\u00e9 leaders to persuade the Russian authorities to change their mind, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917. Still, some Czechs and Slovaks were able to sidestep this ban by enlisting POWs through local agreements with Russian military authorities.<ref>Brent Mueggenberg, ''The Czecho-Slovak Struggle for Independence 1914\u20131920'' (Jefferson: McFarland, 2014) 67\u201370.</ref>\n\nUnder these conditions, the Czechoslovak unit in Russia grew very slowly from 1914\u20131917. In early 1916, the ''Dru\u017eina'' was reorganized as the 1st Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. During that year, two more infantry regiments were added, creating the Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade (''\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 st\u0159eleck\u00e1 brig\u00e1da''). This unit distinguished itself during the [[Kerensky Offensive]] in July 1917, when the Czecho-Slovak troops overran Austrian trenches during the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]].<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 86\u201390.</ref>\n\nFollowing the soldiers' stellar performance at Zborov, the [[Russian Provisional Government]] finally granted their \u00e9migr\u00e9 leaders on the [[Czechoslovak National Council]] permission to mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer, a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (''\u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd sbor na Rusi''), also known as the Czechoslovak Legion (''\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 legie'') in Russia. A second division, consisting of four regiments, was added to the Legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 troops by 1918.<ref>Kalvoda, ''Genesis'', 101\u2013105.</ref>\n\n===Evacuation from Bolshevik Russia===\n{{main|Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion}}\nIn November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power throughout Russia and soon began peace negotiations with the [[Central Powers]] at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]]. The chairman of the Czechoslovak National Council, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, who had arrived in Russia earlier that year, began planning for the Legion's departure from Russia and transfer to [[France]] so the Czechoslovaks could continue to fight against the Central Powers. Since most of Russia's main ports were blockaded, Masaryk decided that the Legion should travel from Ukraine to the Pacific port of [[Vladivostok]], where the men would embark on transport vessels that would carry them to Western Europe.<ref>Victor M.

From 5 to 13 March, the Czechoslovak legionaries successfully fought off German attempts to prevent their evacuation in the [[Battle of Bakhmach]].<ref>Henry Baerlein, ''The March of the Seventy Thousand'' (London: Leonard Parsons, 1926) 101\u2013103, 128\u2013129.</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Ukraine and entering [[Soviet Russia]], representatives of the Czechoslovak National Council continued to negotiate with Bolshevik authorities in Moscow and [[Penza]] to iron out the details of the corps' evacuation. On 25 March, the two sides signed the Penza Agreement, in which the legionaries were to surrender most of their weapons in exchange for unmolested passage to Vladivostok. Tensions continued to mount, however, as each side distrusted the other. The Bolsheviks, despite Masaryk's order for the legionaries to remain neutral in Russia's affairs, suspected that the Czechoslovaks might join their counterrevolutionary enemies in the borderlands. Meanwhile, the legionaries were wary of [[Czechoslovak Communist Party in Russia|Czechoslovak Communists]] who were trying to subvert the corps. They also suspected that the Bolsheviks were being pressured by the Central Powers to stall their movement towards Vladivostok.<ref>Victor M. Fic, ''The Bolsheviks and the Czechoslovak Legion'' (New Delhi: Abhinav, 1978) 22\u201338.</ref>\n\nBy May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion was strung out along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] from Penza to Vladivostok. Their evacuation was proving much slower than expected due to dilapidated railway conditions, a shortage of locomotives and the recurring need to negotiate with local soviets along the route. On 14 May, a dispute at the [[Chelyabinsk]] station between legionaries heading east and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] POWs heading west to be repatriated caused the People's Commissar for War, [[Leon Trotsky]], to order the complete disarmament and arrest of the legionaries. At an army congress that convened in Chelyabinsk a few days later, the Czechoslovaks \u2013 against the wishes of the National Council \u2013 refused to disarm and began issuing ultimatums for their passage to Vladivostok.<ref>Fic, ''Bolsheviks'', 230\u2013261.</ref>  This incident sparked the [[Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion|Revolt of the Legions]].\n\n[[File:Czechoslovaks victims of Bolshveki near Vladivostok.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia killed by bolsheviks at [[Nikolsk-Ussuriysky]], 1918.

By June, the two sides were fighting along the railway route from Penza to [[Krasnoyarsk]]. By the end of the month, legionaries under General [[Mikhail Diterikhs]] had taken control of Vladivostok, overthrowing the local Bolshevik administration. On July 6, the Legion declared the city to be an Allied protectorate,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/czech-troops-take-russian-port-of-vladivostok-for-allies|title=Czech troops take Russian port of Vladivostok for Allies \u2013 Jul 6, 1918|website=History.com|access-date=2016-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226035749/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/czech-troops-take-russian-port-of-vladivostok-for-allies|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and legionaires began returning across the Trans-Siberian Railway to support their comrades fighting to their west. Generally, the Czechoslovaks were the victors in their early engagements against the fledgling [[Red Army]].\n\nBy mid-July, the legionaries had seized control of the railway from [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] to [[Irkutsk]], and by the beginning of September they had cleared Bolshevik forces from the entire length of the Trans-Siberian Railway.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 161\u2013177, 188\u2013191.</ref> Legionnaires conquered all the large cities of Siberia, including [[Yekaterinburg]], but Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family were executed on the direct orders of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] less than a week before the arrival of the Legion.\n\n===Involvement in the Russian Civil War, 1918\u20131919===\n[[File:Bronepoezd Orlik.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovaks with [[List_of_armoured_trains#Russia|armored train \"Orl\u00edk\"]], Russia]]\n\nNews of the Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia during the summer of 1918 was welcomed by Allied statesmen in Great Britain and France, who saw the operation as a means to reconstitute an eastern front against Germany.<ref>George Kennan, ''Soviet-American Relations: The Decision to Intervene'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1958) 357\u2013358, 382\u2013384.</ref>  U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who had resisted earlier Allied proposals to intervene in Russia, gave in to domestic and foreign pressure to support the legionaries' evacuation from Siberia. In early July 1918, he published an [[aide-m\u00e9moire]] calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak troops, who were then blocked by Bolshevik forces in [[Transbaikal]].<ref>Kennan, ''Decision to Intervene'', 395\u2013408.</ref>  But by the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, the Czechoslovaks were already there to welcome them. The Allied intervention in Siberia continued so that by autumn 1918, there were 70,000 Japanese, 829 British, 1,400 Italian, 5,002 American and 107 French colonial (Vietnamese) troops in the region. Many of these contingents supported [[White movement|anti-Bolshevik Russians]] and [[Cossack]] warlords who had established regional governments in the wake of the Czechoslovak seizure of the Trans-Siberian Railway.<ref>Benjamin Isitt, ''From Victoria to Vladivostok: Canada's Siberian Expedition, 1917\u201319'' (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press).</ref>\n\nThe Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia impressed Allied statesmen and attracted them to the idea of an independent Czechoslovak state. As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another that summer, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 185\u2013188.</ref>\n\n===Capture of Imperial Gold Reserve===\nShortly after they entered into hostilities against the Bolsheviks, the legionaries began making common cause with anti-Bolshevik, or White, Russians who began forming their own governments behind the Czechoslovaks' lines. The most important of these governments were the [[Komuch]] in Samara and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] in [[Omsk]]. With substantial Czechoslovak help, the [[People's Army of Komuch]] won several important victories, including the capture of [[Kazan]] and an Imperial state gold reserve on 5 August 1918. Czechoslovak pressure was also crucial in convincing the White Russians in Siberia to nominally unify behind the [[Provisional All-Russian Government|All-Russian Provisional Government]], formed at a conference in [[Ufa]] during September 1918.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''A People's Tragedy'' (New York: Viking, 1997) 580\u2013581.</ref>\n\n[[File:Banner of the First Assault Battalion of the Czechoslovak Legions (Reverse).svg|thumb|Banner of the First Assault Battalion of Czechoslovak Legions adopted on 2 February 1919 in [[Yekaterinburg]]]]\n\nDuring the autumn of 1918, the legionaries' enthusiasm for the fighting in Russia, then mostly confined along the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], dropped precipitously. The professor T. G. Masaryk supported them from the United States of America.<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

On 28 October, [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak statehood]] was declared in [[Prague]], arousing the troops with a desire to return to their homeland. The final blow to Czechoslovak morale arrived on 18 November 1918, when a coup in Omsk overthrew the All-Russian Provisional Government and installed a dictatorship under Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] in control of White Siberia.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 215\u2013225.</ref>\n\nDuring the winter of 1918\u20131919, the Czechoslovak troops were redeployed from the front to guard the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway between [[Novonikolaevsk]] and Irkutsk from [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] attacks. Alongside other legions formed from [[Polish 5th Rifle Division|Polish]], [[Romanian Volunteer Corps in Russia|Romanian]] and Yugoslav POWs in Siberia, the Czechoslovaks defended the Kolchak government's only supply route for the duration of 1919.<ref>Mueggenberg, ''Czecho-Slovak Struggle'', 249.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1919, [[Siberian Army|Kolchak's armies]] were in a steady retreat from the Red Eastern Army Group. On 14 November, the Reds took Omsk, Kolchak's capital, initiating a desperate [[Great Siberian Ice March|eastward flight]] by the White army and refugees along the Trans-Siberian Railway. In the following weeks, the Whites' rear was further disorganized by widespread outbreaks of uprisings and partisan activity. The homesick legionaries, who simply wanted to leave Siberia without incurring any more casualties than necessary, declared their neutrality amid the unrest and did nothing to suppress the rebellions. Meanwhile, Kolchak's trains, which included the gold bullion captured from Kazan, were stranded along the railway near [[Nizhneudinsk]]. After his bodyguard deserted him there, the legionaries were ordered by Allied representatives in Siberia to safely escort the admiral to Vladivostok. This plan was resisted by insurgents along the Czechoslovaks' route, and as a result the legionaries, after consulting their commanders, Generals [[Maurice Janin|Janin]] and [[Jan Syrov\u00fd]], made the controversial decision to turn Kolchak over to the Political Center, a government formed by [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialists-Revolutionaries]] in Irkutsk. On 7 February 1920, the legionaries had signed an armistice with the Fifth Red Army at Kutin, whereby the latter allowed the Czechoslovaks unmolested passage to Vladivostok. In exchange, the legionaries agreed to not try to rescue Kolchak and to leave the remaining gold bullion with the authorities in Irkutsk. Earlier that day, Kolchak had been executed by a [[Cheka]] firing squad to prevent his rescue by a small White army then on the outskirts of the city.<ref>Jonathon Smele, ''Civil War in Siberia'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996) 544\u2013665.</ref>\n\n===Evacuation from Vladivostok, 1920===\nWhen the armistice with the Bolsheviks was concluded, dozens of Czechoslovak trains were still west of Irkutsk. On 1 March 1920, the last Czechoslovak train passed through that city. The legionaries' progress was still hampered at times by the Japanese Expeditionary Force and the troops of [[Ataman]] [[Ataman Semenov|Grigori Semenov]], who stalled the Czechoslovak trains to delay the arrival of the Red Army in Eastern Siberia. By then, however, the evacuation of Czechoslovak troops from Vladivostok was well underway, and the last legionaries left the port in September 1920. The total number of people evacuated with the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia was 67,739;{{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=The numbers don't match up: 67,739 vs. 70,739 when you add the numbers up}} including 56,455 soldiers, 3,004 officers, 6,714 civilians, 1,716 wives, 717 children, 1,935 foreigners and 198 others.<ref>Bradley, ''Czechoslovak Legion'', 156.</ref>  After their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new [[Czechoslovak Army]].\n\nThe number of legionaries killed in Russia during World War I and the Russian Civil War amounted to 4,112.<ref>Bradley, ''Czechoslovak Legion'', 156.</ref>  An unknown number went missing or deserted the legion, either to make an arduous journey to return home or to join the Czechoslovak Communists.<ref>Joan McGuire Mohr, ''The Czech and Slovak Legion in Siberia 1917\u20131922'' (Jefferson: McFarland, 2012) 157.</ref>  Among the latter was [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]], later the author of the satirical novel ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]''.\n\n==Legion in France==\n{{main|Czechoslovak Legion in France}}\n[[File:Tcheco-slovaques a la caserne de Reuilly.PNG|thumb|Czechoslovak Legions in France]]\n\nIn France, the Czechs and Slovaks who wanted to fight [[Austria-Hungary]] were allowed to join the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] (hence originated the term ''Legion'' for units of Czechoslovak volunteers). In 31 August 1914, the 1st [[company (military unit)|Company]] of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Foreign Legion in [[Bayonne]] was created mostly of the Czechs and was nicknamed \"''rota Nazdar''\" (\"Nazdar!\" Company). The company distinguished itself in heavy combat during assaults near [[Arras]] on May 9 and June 16, 1915. Because of heavy casualties, the Company was disbanded, and volunteers continued to fight in various French units.\n\nNew autonomous Czechoslovak units were established by the decree of the French government in 19 December 1917. In January 1918, the 21st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was formed in the town of [[Cognac, France|Cognac]]; it mixed prisoners of war with volunteers living in America. The 22nd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was created later in May.\n\n==Legion in Italy==\n{{main|Czechoslovak Legion in Italy}}\n[[File:\u010cs. legie v It\u00e1lii.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovak Legions in Italy]]\n\nThe creation of Czechoslovak units in Italy took place much later than in France or in Russia. In January 1918, the commander of 6th Italian Army decided to form small reconnaissance groups from Czech, Slovak and Southern Slav volunteers from [[POW camp]]s. They also served in propaganda actions against Austrian army. In September 1918, first fighting unit, the 39th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Italian Legion was formed of those volunteer reconnaissance squadrons.\n\nItalian legionaries were the first who returned to newly created [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1918 and were immediately drafted into fights for new state borders. Most notably in the war against [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].\n\n==After the war==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Darney, pam\u00e1tn\u00edk, legion\u00e1\u0159i.JPG|thumb|Remembrance Ceremony at the memorial of 30 June 2013 with the unit in uniforms of CS legionnaires in France]]\n[[File:Bank of the Czechoslovak Legions, Prague.jpg|thumb|left|The fa\u00e7ade of the Legiobanka main office in Prague is decorated with reliefs of war scenes.]]\n\nMembers of the legions formed a significant part of the new Czechoslovak Army. Many of them fought in 1919 in the [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak War]] over [[Zaolzie]] and in a war with Hungary over Slovakia.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nLegion veterans formed organizations such as [[the Association of Czechoslovak Legionnaires]] (''[[\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 obec legion\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1]]'') and [[Legiobanka]] (''Legion\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 banka'', a bank formed with the capital they had gathered during their long service).\nThese and other organizations were known as the ''[[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]]'' (\"The [Prague] Castle\") for their support of the [[President of Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==In literature==\nThe 2005 novel ''The People's Act of Love'', by the British writer [[James Meek (author)|James Meek]], describes the occupation of a small Siberian town by a company of the Czechoslovak Legion in 1919.

Fur colouring, in particular the facial mask, bears some similarity to [[raccoon]]s and a number of [[civet]]s. Behavior also: Raccoon dogs are nocturnal, yet adjust their daily schedule and habits in response to local availability of food, similar to [[viverrids]], [[ferret]]s, [[weasel]]s, raccoons, and [[red panda]]s, to which raccoon dogs are not closely related.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeveloff |first=S.I. |year=2002 |title=Raccoons: a natural history |chapter=10 |publisher=UBC Press}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nRaccoon dogs are [[omnivore]]s that feed on [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[mollusks]], [[carrion]], and [[insectivore]]s, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries.<ref>Sutor, A., Kauhala, K., & Ansorge, H.

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]]. In Ukraine, the greatest numbers of raccoon dogs were established in [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], and [[Luhansk Oblast|Lugansk]].<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn 1948, 35&nbsp;raccoon dogs were introduced into Latvia.

Birds amount to 15\u201320% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the [[Oka River]] floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve. They are also harmful to the [[muskrat]] trade, destroying their nests and eating their young. In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to [[kitchen garden]]s, [[melon]] cultivations, [[vineyard]]s, and [[corn]] seedlings.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hunting===\nRaccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.<ref name=canids />\n\n===Fur use===\n[[File:Raccoon_dog_12.jpg|right|thumb|A caged raccoon dog]]\n[[File:Chinese raccoon fur skins.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese raccoon dog pelts on sale in [[Milan]], Italy]]\n\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur. In the United States, it is marketed as \"Asiatic raccoon\", and in Northern Europe as \"Finn raccoon\".<ref name=furtypes>{{cite web|url=http://www.furcommission.com/farming/mink-biology/furtypes/|title=Fur Types in Brief|work=Furcommission.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs. Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max. (1953). ''Fur: a practical treatise'', 3rd ed. New York: Prentice-Hall.</ref> When raised in captivity, raccoon dogs can produce 100&nbsp;g of wool of slightly lesser quality than that of [[goat]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn the Japanese islands, the natives employed raccoon dog skin to make bellows, to decorate their drums, and for winter headgear.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Russian trade in raccoon dogs was quite developed in the Primorye and Ussuri areas in the 1880s. The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring.

In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]].

In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998.

Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max.

The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?
