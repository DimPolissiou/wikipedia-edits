The world premi\u00e8re of the symphony was held on 5 March 1942 in [[Samara, Russia|Kuybyshev]] with the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra]]. The Leningrad premi\u00e8re was performed by the surviving musicians of the [[Leningrad Radio Orchestra]], supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city#Food shortages|starvation]], which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.\n\nDespite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a [[Northern Front (Soviet Union)|Soviet military]] offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence [[Army Group North|German forces]] during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of [[psychological warfare]]. The Leningrad premi\u00e8re was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and [[Music and political warfare|political effects]]. The conductor concluded that \"in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine\".{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=261}} Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:RIAN archive 216 The Volkovo cemetery.jpg|thumb|The siege caused mass casualties from cold and starvation.]]\nSoviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich (1906\u20131975) completed his [[Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 7]] on 27 December 1941 and dedicated it to his native Leningrad.

The world premi\u00e8re of the symphony was held on 5 March 1942 in [[Samara, Russia|Kuybyshev]] with the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra]]. The Leningrad premi\u00e8re was performed by the surviving musicians of the [[Leningrad Radio Orchestra]], supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city#Food shortages|starvation]], which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.\n\nDespite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a [[Northern Front (Soviet Union)|Soviet military]] offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence [[Army Group North|German forces]] during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of [[psychological warfare]]. The Leningrad premi\u00e8re was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and [[Music and political warfare|political effects]]. The conductor concluded that \"in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine\".{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=261}} Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:RIAN archive 216 The Volkovo cemetery.jpg|thumb|The siege caused mass casualties from cold and starvation.]]\nSoviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich (1906\u20131975) completed his [[Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 7]] on 27 December 1941 and dedicated it to his native Leningrad.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

It is the only licensed student station broadcasting in Northern Ireland, and one of several on the island.\n\n== History ==\nQueen's Radio began broadcasting on 29 September 2003, initially over the Queen's University campus network and then the internet. In late 2005, the station was successful in acquiring a [[LPAM|low-powered AM]] licence, allowing it to broadcast to Queen's Halls of Residence ([[Elms Village]]) directly via Medium Wave. This service commenced on 6 February 2006.\n\nQueen's Radio is operated by the 'Queen's University of Belfast Radio Club', which was originally formed in 1953, making it two years older than the independent student newspaper [[The Gown]]. The old Radio Club was a general purpose electronics, amateur radio and computer club, and provided facilities for students to pursue hobby interests in these areas and participated in amateur radio contests, etc. In the late 1990s the University evicted it from its premises in Fitzwilliam St and the club became almost dormant for several years.\n\nIn 2001, the Radio Club was taken over by a group of students with the intention of forming a broadcast radio station, and giving QUB students experience of all aspects of broadcast radio. After two years of acquiring equipment, building up membership and negotiating with the Students' Union for premises, the station was ready to broadcast at the start of term in the 2003/04 academic year.

It is the only licensed student station broadcasting in Northern Ireland, and one of several on the island.\n\n== History ==\nQueen's Radio began broadcasting on 29 September 2003, initially over the Queen's University campus network and then the internet. In late 2005, the station was successful in acquiring a [[LPAM|low-powered AM]] licence, allowing it to broadcast to Queen's Halls of Residence ([[Elms Village]]) directly via Medium Wave. This service commenced on 6 February 2006.\n\nQueen's Radio is operated by the 'Queen's University of Belfast Radio Club', which was originally formed in 1953, making it two years older than the independent student newspaper [[The Gown]]. The old Radio Club was a general purpose electronics, amateur radio and computer club, and provided facilities for students to pursue hobby interests in these areas and participated in amateur radio contests, etc. In the late 1990s the University evicted it from its premises in Fitzwilliam St and the club became almost dormant for several years.\n\nIn 2001, the Radio Club was taken over by a group of students with the intention of forming a broadcast radio station, and giving QUB students experience of all aspects of broadcast radio. After two years of acquiring equipment, building up membership and negotiating with the Students' Union for premises, the station was ready to broadcast at the start of term in the 2003/04 academic year. The first live show was 'The Lunchbox' presented by Ian Llewellyn, although a pilot show had already been recorded by Shane Horan before the summer break.\n\nThere was previously a temporary RSL (restricted service licence) FM radio station at Queen's called 'Fresh Air'.

{"title_page": "Inverse trigonometric functions", "text_new": "{{Trigonometry}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''inverse trigonometric functions''' (occasionally also called '''arcus functions''',<ref name=\"Taczanowski_1978\"/><ref name=\"Hazewinkel_1994\"/><ref name=\"Ebner_2005\"/><ref name=\"Mejlbro_2010\"/><ref name=\"Duran_2012\"/> '''antitrigonometric functions'''<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> or '''cyclometric functions'''<ref name=\"Klein_1924\"/><ref name=\"Klein_2004\"/><ref name=\"D\u00f6rrie_1965\"/>) are the [[inverse function]]s of the [[trigonometric functions]] (with suitably restricted [[Domain of a function|domain]]s). Specifically, they are the inverses of the [[sine]], [[cosine]], [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangent]], [[cotangent]], [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]], and [[cosecant]] functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in [[engineering]], [[navigation]], [[physics]], and [[geometry]].\n\n==Notation==\nThere are several notations used for the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nThe most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix: {{math|arcsin(''x'')}}, {{math|arccos(''x'')}}, {{math|arctan(''x'')}}, etc.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> (This convention is used throughout this article.)  This notation arises from the following geometric relationships:{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nWhen measuring in radians, an angle of ''\u03b8'' radians will correspond to an arc whose length is ''r\u03b8'', where ''r'' is the radius of the circle. Thus, in the [[unit circle]], \"the arc whose cosine is ''x''\" is the same as \"the angle whose cosine is ''x''\", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians.<ref name=\"Americana_1912\"/> In computer programming languages the inverse trigonometric functions are usually called by the abbreviated forms asin, acos, atan.{{citation needed|reason=\"usually\" is a claim that deserves defense.|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe notations {{math|sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|cos<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|tan<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, etc., as introduced by [[John Herschel]] in 1813,<ref name=\"Cajori\"/><ref name=\"Herschel_1813\"/> are often used as well in English-language<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> sources, and this convention complies with the notation of an [[inverse function]]. This might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions like {{math|sin<sup>2</sup>(''x'')}}, which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between [[multiplicative inverse]] or reciprocal and [[Inverse function|compositional inverse]]. The confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name\u2014for example, {{math|(cos(''x''))<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} = {{math|sec(''x'')}}. Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Korn_2000\"/> Another convention used by a few authors is to use a [[majuscule]] (capital/upper-case) first letter along with a &minus;1 superscript: {{math|Sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|Cos<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|Tan<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, etc.<ref name=\"Bhatti_1999\"/>  This potentially avoids confusion with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by {{math|sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|cos<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, etc.\n\nSince 2009, the [[ISO 80000-2#Function symbols and definitions|ISO 80000-2]] standard has specified solely the \"arc\" prefix for the inverse functions.\n\n==Basic properties==\n\n===Principal values===\nSince none of the six trigonometric functions are [[One-to-one function|one-to-one]], they are restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore, the [[Range of a function|range]]s of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the domains of the original functions.\n\nFor example, using ''function'' in the sense of [[multivalued function]]s, just as the [[square root]] function {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} could be defined from {{math|''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''}}, the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} arcsin(''x'')}} is defined so that sin(''y'') = ''x''. For a given real number ''x'', with \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1, there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers ''y'' such that {{math|sin(''y'') {{=}} ''x''}}; for example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin(&pi;) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2&pi;) {{=}} 0}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]]. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nThe principal inverses are listed in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!Name\n!Usual notation\n!Definition\n!Domain of ''x'' for real result\n!Range of usual principal value <br /> ([[radian]]s)\n!Range of usual principal value <br /> ([[Degree (angle)|degrees]])\n|-\n| '''arcsine''' || ''y'' = {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[sine|sin]](''y'')}} || \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1 || \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} || \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 90\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arccosine''' || ''y'' = {{math|arccos(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[cosine|cos]](''y'')}} || \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1 || 0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}} || 0\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 180\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arctangent''' || ''y'' = {{math|arctan(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[Tangent (trigonometry)|tan]](''y'')}} || all real numbers || \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} || \u221290\u00b0 < ''y'' < 90\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arccotangent''' || ''y'' = {{math|arccot(''x'')}} ||''x'' = {{math|[[cotangent|cot]](''y'')}} || all real numbers\n| 0 < ''y'' < {{pi}} || 0\u00b0 < ''y'' < 180\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arcsecant''' || ''y'' = {{math|arcsec(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[Secant (trigonometry)|sec]](''y'')}} || ''x'' \u2264 \u22121 or 1 \u2264 ''x'' || 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}} || 0\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' < 90\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 < ''y'' \u2264 180\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arccosecant''' || ''y'' = {{math|arccsc(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[cosecant|csc]](''y'')}} || ''x'' \u2264 \u22121 or 1 \u2264 ''x'' || \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} \u2264 ''y'' < 0 or 0 < ''y'' \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} || \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' < 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 < ''y'' \u2264 90\u00b0\n|-\n|}\n(Note: Some authors define the range of arcsecant to be ( 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{pi}} \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}} ), because the tangent function is nonnegative on this domain. This makes some computations more consistent. For example, using this range, {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1}}}}, whereas with the range ( 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}} ), we would have to write {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} \u00b1{{sqrt|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1}}}}, since tangent is nonnegative on 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} but nonpositive on {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}}. For a similar reason, the same authors define the range of arccosecant to be \u2212{{pi}} < ''y'' \u2264 \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or 0 < ''y'' \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.)\n\nIf ''x'' is allowed to be a [[complex number]], then the range of ''y'' applies only to its real part.\n\n===Relationships between trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions===\n\nTrigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1 and another side of length ''x'', then applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. Purely algebraic derivations are longer.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!<math>\\theta</math>\n!<math>\\sin(\\theta)</math>\n!<math>\\cos(\\theta)</math>\n!<math>\\tan(\\theta)</math>\n!Diagram\n|-\n!<math>\\arcsin(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arcsin(x)) = x </math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arcsin(x)) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arcsin(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse3.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arccos(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arccos(x)) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arccos(x)) = x </math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arccos(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arctan(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arctan(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arctan(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = x</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse2.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arccot(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arccot(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arccot(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arccot(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse4.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arccsc(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arccsc(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arccsc(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arccsc(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse5.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arcsec(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arcsec(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arcsec(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arcsec(x)) = \\sqrt{x^2-1}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse6.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Relationships among the inverse trigonometric functions===\n[[Image:Arcsine Arccosine.svg|168px|right|thumb|The usual principal values of the arcsin(''x'') (red) and arccos(''x'') (blue) functions graphed on the cartesian plane.]]\n[[Image:Arctangent Arccotangent.svg|294px|right|thumb|The usual principal values of the arctan(''x'') and arccot(''x'') functions graphed on the cartesian plane.]]\n[[Image:Arcsecant Arccosecant.svg|294px|right|thumb|Principal values of the arcsec(''x'') and arccsc(''x'') functions graphed on the cartesian plane.]]\n\nComplementary angles:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\arccos(x) &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} -

The signum function is also necessary due to the absolute values in the [[#Derivatives|derivative]]s of the two functions, which create two different solutions for positive and negative values of x.

This results in functions with multiple sheets and [[branch point]]s. One possible way of defining the extension is:\n:<math>\\arctan(z) = \\int_0^z \\frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \\quad z \\neq -i, +i </math>\nwhere the part of the imaginary axis which does not lie strictly between the branch points (&minus;i and +i) is the [[branch cut]] between the principal sheet and other sheets. The path of the integral must not cross a branch cut. For ''z'' not on a branch cut, a straight line path from 0 to ''z'' is such a path. For ''z'' on a branch cut, the path must approach from Re[x]>0 for the upper branch cut and from Re[x]<0 for the lower branch cut.\n\nThe arcsine function may then be defined as:\n\n:<math>\\arcsin(z) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{1 - z^2}}\\right) \\quad z \\neq -1, +1 </math>\nwhere (the square-root function has its cut along the negative real axis and) the part of the real axis which does not lie strictly between &minus;1 and +1 is the branch cut between the principal sheet of arcsin and other sheets;\n:<math>\\arccos(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arcsin(z) \\quad z \\neq -1, +1 </math>\nwhich has the same cut as arcsin;\n:<math>\\arccot(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(z) \\quad z \\neq -i, i </math>\nwhich has the same cut as arctan;\n:<math>\\arcsec(z) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) \\quad z \\neq -1, 0, +1 </math>\nwhere the part of the real axis between &minus;1 and +1 inclusive is the cut between the principal sheet of arcsec and other sheets;\n:<math>\\arccsc(z) = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) \\quad z \\neq -1, 0, +1 </math>\nwhich has the same cut as '''arcsec'''.\n\n===Logarithmic forms===\nThese functions may also be expressed using [[complex logarithm]]s.

Algebraically, this gives us:\n\n:<math>\nce^{\\theta i} = c\\cos(\\theta) + ci\\sin(\\theta)\n</math>\nor\n:<math>\nce^{\\theta i} = a + bi\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> is the adjacent side, <math>b</math> is the opposite side, and <math>c</math> is the hypotenuse. From here, we can solve for <math>\\theta</math>.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ne^{\\ln(c) + \\theta i} & = a + bi \\\\\n\\ln c + \\theta i & = \\ln(a + bi) \\\\\n\\theta & = Im\\left( \\ln(a + bi) \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\nor\n:<math>\n\\theta = -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{a + bi}{c} \\right) = i\\ln\\left( \\frac{c}{a + bi} \\right)\n</math>\n\nSimply taking the imaginary part works for any real-valued <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, but if <math>a</math> or <math>b</math> is complex-valued, we have to use the final equation so that the real part of the result isn't excluded. Since the length of the hypotenuse doesn't change the angle, ignoring the real part of <math>ln(a+bi)</math> also removes <math>c</math> from the equation. In the final equation, we see that the angle of the triangle in the complex plane can be found by inputting the lengths of each side. By setting one of the three sides equal to 1 and one of the remaining sides equal to our input <math>z</math>, we obtain a formula for one of the inverse trig functions, for a total of six equations. Because the inverse trig functions require only one input, we must put the final side of the triangle in terms of the other two using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]] relation\n:<math>\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n</math>\nThe table below shows the values of a, b, and c for each of the inverse trig functions and the equivalent expressions for <math>\\theta</math> that result from plugging the values into the equations above and simplifying.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n & a & & b & & c && \\theta && \\theta_{simplified} && \\theta_{a,b\\in\\R}\\\\\narcsin(z)\\ \\ & \\sqrt{1 - z^2} & & z & & 1 & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - z^2} + zi}{1} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{1 - z^2} + zi \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{1 - z^2} + zi \\right)\\right) \\\\\narccos(z)\\ \\ & z & & \\sqrt{1 - z^2} & & 1 & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{z + i\\sqrt{1 - z^2}}{1} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} \\right)\\right) \\\\\narctan(z)\\ \\ & 1 & & z & & \\sqrt{1 + z^2} & & i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + z^2}}{1 + zi} \\right) && = \\frac{i}{2}\\ln\\left( \\frac{i+z}{i-z} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( 1 + zi \\right)\\right) \\\\\narccot(z)\\ \\ & z & & 1 & & \\sqrt{z^2 + 1} & & i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{z^2 + 1}}{z + i} \\right) && = \\frac{i}{2}\\ln\\left( \\frac{z-i}{z + i} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( z + i \\right)\\right) \\\\\narcsec(z)\\ \\ & 1 & & \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} & & z & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{z^2 - 1}}{z} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{z} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{z^2}-1} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1-z^2} \\right)\\right) \\\\\narccsc(z)\\ \\ & \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} & & 1 & & z & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{z^2 - 1} + i}{z} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{z^2}} + \\frac{i}{z} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} + i \\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this sense, all of the inverse trig functions can be thought of as specific cases of the complex-valued log function.

In other words, atan2(''y'',&nbsp;''x'') is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis of a plane and  the point (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, ''y''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.\n \nIn terms of the standard '''arctan''' function, that is with range of (\u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}), it can be expressed as follows:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\arctan(\\frac y x) & \\quad x > 0 \\\\\n  \\arctan(\\frac y x) + \\pi & \\quad y \\ge 0 \\; , \\; x < 0 \\\\\n  \\arctan(\\frac y x) - \\pi & \\quad y < 0 \\; , \\; x < 0 \\\\\n  \\frac{\\pi}{2} & \\quad y > 0 \\; , \\; x = 0 \\\\\n  -\\frac{\\pi}{2} & \\quad y < 0 \\; , \\; x = 0 \\\\\n  \\text{undefined} & \\quad y = 0 \\; , \\; x = 0\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIt also equals the [[principal value]] of the [[arg (mathematics)|arg]]ument of the [[complex number]] ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;'''i'''''y''.\n\nThis function may also be defined using the [[tangent half-angle formula]]e as follows:\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\\right)</math>\nprovided that either ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 or ''y''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0.

Specifically, they are the inverses of the [[sine]], [[cosine]], [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangent]], [[cotangent]], [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]], and [[cosecant]] functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in [[engineering]], [[navigation]], [[physics]], and [[geometry]].\n\n==Notation==\nThere are several notations used for the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nThe most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix: {{math|arcsin(''x'')}}, {{math|arccos(''x'')}}, {{math|arctan(''x'')}}, etc.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> (This convention is used throughout this article.)  This notation arises from the following geometric relationships:{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nWhen measuring in radians, an angle of ''\u03b8'' radians will correspond to an arc whose length is ''r\u03b8'', where ''r'' is the radius of the circle. Thus, in the [[unit circle]], \"the arc whose cosine is ''x''\" is the same as \"the angle whose cosine is ''x''\", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians.<ref name=\"Americana_1912\"/> In computer programming languages the inverse trigonometric functions are usually called by the abbreviated forms asin, acos, atan.{{citation needed|reason=\"usually\" is a claim that deserves defense.|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe notations {{math|sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|cos<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|tan<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, etc., as introduced by [[John Herschel]] in 1813,<ref name=\"Cajori\"/><ref name=\"Herschel_1813\"/> are often used as well in English-language<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> sources, and this convention complies with the notation of an [[inverse function]]. This might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions like {{math|sin<sup>2</sup>(''x'')}}, which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between [[multiplicative inverse]] or reciprocal and [[Inverse function|compositional inverse]]. The confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name\u2014for example, {{math|(cos(''x''))<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} = {{math|sec(''x'')}}. Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Korn_2000\"/> Another convention used by a few authors is to use a [[majuscule]] (capital/upper-case) first letter along with a &minus;1 superscript: {{math|Sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|Cos<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|Tan<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, etc.<ref name=\"Bhatti_1999\"/>  This potentially avoids confusion with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by {{math|sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, {{math|cos<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''x'')}}, etc.\n\nSince 2009, the [[ISO 80000-2#Function symbols and definitions|ISO 80000-2]] standard has specified solely the \"arc\" prefix for the inverse functions.\n\n==Basic properties==\n\n===Principal values===\nSince none of the six trigonometric functions are [[One-to-one function|one-to-one]], they are restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore, the [[Range (mathematics)|range]]s of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the domains of the original functions.\n\nFor example, using ''function'' in the sense of [[multivalued function]]s, just as the [[square root]] function {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} could be defined from {{math|''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''}}, the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} arcsin(''x'')}} is defined so that sin(''y'') = ''x''. For a given real number ''x'', with \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1, there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers ''y'' such that {{math|sin(''y'') {{=}} ''x''}}; for example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin(&pi;) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2&pi;) {{=}} 0}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]]. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nThe principal inverses are listed in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!Name\n!Usual notation\n!Definition\n!Domain of ''x'' for real result\n!Range of usual principal value <br /> ([[radian]]s)\n!Range of usual principal value <br /> ([[Degree (angle)|degrees]])\n|-\n| '''arcsine''' || ''y'' = {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[sine|sin]](''y'')}} || \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1 || \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} || \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 90\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arccosine''' || ''y'' = {{math|arccos(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[cosine|cos]](''y'')}} || \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 1 || 0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}} || 0\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 180\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arctangent''' || ''y'' = {{math|arctan(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[Tangent (trigonometry)|tan]](''y'')}} || all real numbers || \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} || \u221290\u00b0 < ''y'' < 90\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arccotangent''' || ''y'' = {{math|arccot(''x'')}} ||''x'' = {{math|[[cotangent|cot]](''y'')}} || all real numbers\n| 0 < ''y'' < {{pi}} || 0\u00b0 < ''y'' < 180\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arcsecant''' || ''y'' = {{math|arcsec(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[Secant (trigonometry)|sec]](''y'')}} || ''x'' \u2264 \u22121 or 1 \u2264 ''x'' || 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}} || 0\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' < 90\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 < ''y'' \u2264 180\u00b0\n|-\n| '''arccosecant''' || ''y'' = {{math|arccsc(''x'')}} || ''x'' = {{math|[[cosecant|csc]](''y'')}} || ''x'' \u2264 \u22121 or 1 \u2264 ''x'' || \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} \u2264 ''y'' < 0 or 0 < ''y'' \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} || \u221290\u00b0 \u2264 ''y'' < 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 < ''y'' \u2264 90\u00b0\n|-\n|}\n(Note: Some authors define the range of arcsecant to be ( 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{pi}} \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}} ), because the tangent function is nonnegative on this domain. This makes some computations more consistent. For example, using this range, {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1}}}}, whereas with the range ( 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}} ), we would have to write {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} \u00b1{{sqrt|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1}}}}, since tangent is nonnegative on 0 \u2264 ''y'' < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} but nonpositive on {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} < ''y'' \u2264 {{pi}}. For a similar reason, the same authors define the range of arccosecant to be \u2212{{pi}} < ''y'' \u2264 \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or 0 < ''y'' \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.)\n\nIf ''x'' is allowed to be a [[complex number]], then the range of ''y'' applies only to its real part.\n\n===Relationships between trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions===\n\nTrigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1 and another side of length ''x'', then applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. Purely algebraic derivations are longer.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!<math>\\theta</math>\n!<math>\\sin(\\theta)</math>\n!<math>\\cos(\\theta)</math>\n!<math>\\tan(\\theta)</math>\n!Diagram\n|-\n!<math>\\arcsin(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arcsin(x)) = x </math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arcsin(x)) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arcsin(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse3.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arccos(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arccos(x)) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arccos(x)) = x </math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arccos(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arctan(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arctan(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arctan(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = x</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse2.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arccot(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arccot(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arccot(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arccot(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse4.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arccsc(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arccsc(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arccsc(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arccsc(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse5.svg|150px]]\n|-\n!<math>\\arcsec(x)</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\arcsec(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\arcsec(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\arcsec(x)) = \\sqrt{x^2-1}</math>\n|[[File:Trigonometric functions and inverse6.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Relationships among the inverse trigonometric functions===\n[[Image:Arcsine Arccosine.svg|168px|right|thumb|The usual principal values of the arcsin(''x'') (red) and arccos(''x'') (blue) functions graphed on the cartesian plane.]]\n[[Image:Arctangent Arccotangent.svg|294px|right|thumb|The usual principal values of the arctan(''x'') and arccot(''x'') functions graphed on the cartesian plane.]]\n[[Image:Arcsecant Arccosecant.svg|294px|right|thumb|Principal values of the arcsec(''x'') and arccsc(''x'') functions graphed on the cartesian plane.]]\n\nComplementary angles:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\arccos(x) &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} -

There are two cuts, from &minus;'''i''' to the point at infinity, going down the imaginary axis, and from '''i''' to the point at infinity, going up the same axis.

The signum function is also necessary due to the absolute values in the [[#Derivatives|derivative]]s of the two functions, which create two different solutions for positive and negative values of x.

This results in functions with multiple sheets and [[branch point]]s. One possible way of defining the extension is:\n:<math>\\arctan(z) = \\int_0^z \\frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \\quad z \\neq -i, +i </math>\nwhere the part of the imaginary axis which does not lie strictly between the branch points (&minus;i and +i) is the [[branch cut]] between the principal sheet and other sheets. The path of the integral must not cross a branch cut. For ''z'' not on a branch cut, a straight line path from 0 to ''z'' is such a path. For ''z'' on a branch cut, the path must approach from Re[x]>0 for the upper branch cut and from Re[x]<0 for the lower branch cut.\n\nThe arcsine function may then be defined as:\n\n:<math>\\arcsin(z) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{1 - z^2}}\\right) \\quad z \\neq -1, +1 </math>\nwhere (the square-root function has its cut along the negative real axis and) the part of the real axis which does not lie strictly between &minus;1 and +1 is the branch cut between the principal sheet of arcsin and other sheets;\n:<math>\\arccos(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arcsin(z) \\quad z \\neq -1, +1 </math>\nwhich has the same cut as arcsin;\n:<math>\\arccot(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(z) \\quad z \\neq -i, i </math>\nwhich has the same cut as arctan;\n:<math>\\arcsec(z) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) \\quad z \\neq -1, 0, +1 </math>\nwhere the part of the real axis between &minus;1 and +1 inclusive is the cut between the principal sheet of arcsec and other sheets;\n:<math>\\arccsc(z) = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) \\quad z \\neq -1, 0, +1 </math>\nwhich has the same cut as '''arcsec'''.\n\n===Logarithmic forms===\nThese functions may also be expressed using [[complex logarithm]]s.

Algebraically, this gives us:\n\n:<math>\nce^{\\theta i} = c\\cos(\\theta) + ci\\sin(\\theta)\n</math>\nor\n:<math>\nce^{\\theta i} = a + bi\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> is the adjacent side, <math>b</math> is the opposite side, and <math>c</math> is the hypotenuse. From here, we can solve for <math>\\theta</math>.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ne^{\\ln(c) + \\theta i} & = a + bi \\\\\n\\ln c + \\theta i & = \\ln(a + bi) \\\\\n\\theta & = Im\\left( \\ln(a + bi) \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\nor\n:<math>\n\\theta = -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{a + bi}{c} \\right) = i\\ln\\left( \\frac{c}{a + bi} \\right)\n</math>\n\nSimply taking the imaginary part works for any real-valued <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, but if <math>a</math> or <math>b</math> is complex-valued, we have to use the final equation so that the real part of the result isn't excluded. Since the length of the hypotenuse doesn't change the angle, ignoring the real part of <math>ln(a+bi)</math> also removes <math>c</math> from the equation. In the final equation, we see that the angle of the triangle in the complex plane can be found by inputting the lengths of each side. By setting one of the three sides equal to 1 and one of the remaining sides equal to our input <math>z</math>, we obtain a formula for one of the inverse trig functions, for a total of six equations. Because the inverse trig functions require only one input, we must put the final side of the triangle in terms of the other two using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]] relation\n:<math>\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n</math>\nThe table below shows the values of a, b, and c for each of the inverse trig functions and the equivalent expressions for <math>\\theta</math> that result from plugging the values into the equations above and simplifying.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n & a & & b & & c && \\theta && \\theta_{simplified} && \\theta_{a,b\\in\\R}\\\\\narcsin(z)\\ \\ & \\sqrt{1 - z^2} & & z & & 1 & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - z^2} + zi}{1} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{1 - z^2} + zi \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{1 - z^2} + zi \\right)\\right) \\\\\narccos(z)\\ \\ & z & & \\sqrt{1 - z^2} & & 1 & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{z + i\\sqrt{1 - z^2}}{1} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} \\right)\\right) \\\\\narctan(z)\\ \\ & 1 & & z & & \\sqrt{1 + z^2} & & i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + z^2}}{1 + zi} \\right) && = \\frac{i}{2}\\ln\\left( \\frac{i+z}{i-z} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( 1 + zi \\right)\\right) \\\\\narccot(z)\\ \\ & z & & 1 & & \\sqrt{z^2 + 1} & & i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{z^2 + 1}}{z + i} \\right) && = \\frac{i}{2}\\ln\\left( \\frac{z-i}{z + i} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( z + i \\right)\\right) \\\\\narcsec(z)\\ \\ & 1 & & \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} & & z & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{z^2 - 1}}{z} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{z} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{z^2}-1} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1-z^2} \\right)\\right) \\\\\narccsc(z)\\ \\ & \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} & & 1 & & z & & -i\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{z^2 - 1} + i}{z} \\right) && = -i\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{z^2}} + \\frac{i}{z} \\right) && Im\\left(\\ln\\left( \\sqrt{z^2 - 1} + i \\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this sense, all of the inverse trig functions can be thought of as specific cases of the complex-valued log function.

Recalling the right-triangle definitions of sine and cosine, it follows that\n\n:<math>\\theta = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\right) = \\arccos \\left( \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\right) .</math>\n\nOften, the hypotenuse is unknown and would need to be calculated before using arcsine or arccosine using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]: <math>a^2+b^2=h^2</math> where <math>h</math> is the length of the hypotenuse. Arctangent comes in handy in this situation, as the length of the hypotenuse is not needed.\n\n:<math>\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} \\right) \\, .</math>\n\nFor example, suppose a roof drops 8 feet as it runs out 20 feet. The roof makes an angle ''\u03b8'' with the horizontal, where ''\u03b8'' may be computed as follows:\n\n:<math>\\theta\n= \\arctan \\left( \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} \\right)\n= \\arctan \\left( \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} \\right)\n= \\arctan \\left( \\frac{8}{20} \\right) \\approx 21.8^{\\circ} \\, .</math>\n\n===In computer science and engineering===\n\n====Two-argument variant of arctangent====\n{{anchor|Two-argument variant of arctangent}}\n{{main|atan2}}\nThe two-argument [[atan2]] function computes the arctangent of ''y'' / ''x'' given ''y'' and ''x'', but with a range of (\u2212{{pi}},&nbsp;{{pi}}]. In other words, atan2(''y'',&nbsp;''x'') is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis of a plane and  the point (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, ''y''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.\n \nIn terms of the standard '''arctan''' function, that is with range of (\u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}), it can be expressed as follows:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\arctan(\\frac y x) & \\quad x > 0 \\\\\n  \\arctan(\\frac y x) + \\pi & \\quad y \\ge 0 \\; , \\; x < 0 \\\\\n  \\arctan(\\frac y x) - \\pi & \\quad y < 0 \\; , \\; x < 0 \\\\\n  \\frac{\\pi}{2} & \\quad y > 0 \\; , \\; x = 0 \\\\\n  -\\frac{\\pi}{2} & \\quad y < 0 \\; , \\; x = 0 \\\\\n  \\text{undefined} & \\quad y = 0 \\; , \\; x = 0\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIt also equals the [[principal value]] of the [[arg (mathematics)|arg]]ument of the [[complex number]] ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;'''i'''''y''.\n\nThis function may also be defined using the [[tangent half-angle formula]]e as follows:\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\\right)</math>\nprovided that either ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 or ''y''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0. However this fails if given x&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;0 and y&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 so the expression is unsuitable for computational use.\n\nThe above argument order (''y'', ''x'') seems to be the most common, and in particular is used in [[ISO standard]]s such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], but a few authors may use the opposite convention (''x'', ''y'') so some caution is warranted.  These variations are detailed at [[atan2#Realizations of the function in common programming languages|atan2]].\n\n====Arctangent function with location parameter====\nIn many applications<ref>when a time varying angle crossing <math>\\pm\\pi/2</math> should be mapped by a smooth line instead of a saw toothed one (robotics, astromomy, angular movement in general){{cn|date=March 2020}}</ref> the solution <math>y</math> of the equation <math>x=\\tan(y)</math> is to come as close as possible to a given value <math>-\\infty < \\eta < \\infty</math>. The adequate solution is produced by the parameter modified arctangent function \n:<math>\ny = \\arctan_\\eta(x) := \\arctan(x) + \\pi \\cdot \\operatorname{rni}\\left(\\frac{\\eta - \\arctan(x)}{\\pi} \\right)\\, .\n</math>\nThe function <math>\\operatorname{rni}</math> rounds to the nearest integer.\n\n====Numerical accuracy====\n\nFor angles near 0 and {{pi}}, arccosine is [[ill-conditioned]] and will thus calculate the angle with reduced accuracy in a computer implementation (due to the limited number of digits).<ref name=\"Gade_2010\"/> Similarly, arcsine is inaccurate for angles near &minus;{{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}/2.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Inverse exsecant]]\n*[[Inverse versine]]\n*[[Inverse hyperbolic functions]]\n*[[List of integrals of inverse trigonometric functions]]\n*[[List of trigonometric identities]]\n*[[Trigonometric function]]\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"Hall_1909\">{{cite book |title=Trigonometry |volume=Part I: Plane Trigonometry |author1-first=Arthur Graham |author1-last=Hall |author2-first=Fred Goodrich |author2-last=Frink |date=January 1909 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA |chapter=Chapter II.

It is a companion game to ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[survival game]] with construction elements. It was initially released in [[early access]] on September 26, 2017, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], followed by ports for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and the [[Nintendo Switch]] the following year.\n\nThe concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre: 100 players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players. Players can fight alone (Solo), with one additional player (Duos), or with a group of up to three others (Squads). As the match progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts, giving the players less and less room to work with. The last player or team alive wins the match. The main distinction from others in the genre is the game's construction elements, letting players build walls, obstacles, and other structures from collected resources to take cover from incoming fire or give one a strategic view advantage. ''Battle Royale'' uses a seasonal approach with [[battle pass]]es to introduce new character customization content in the game, as well as limited time events, some of which correspond with changes to the game map. Since its initial release, several other game modes have been introduced, including \"Playground\", which somewhat serves as a training mode.\n\nThe idea for ''Battle Royale'' arose following the release of ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'', a similar battle royale game that was highly successful, but was noted for its technical flaws. Originally released as part of the early access version of ''Save the World'', Epic later transitioned the game to a [[free-to-play]] model funded by [[microtransaction]]s. Following its rise in popularity, Epic split the development team, with one focusing on ''Battle Royale'' and the other on ''Save the World''.\n\n''Battle Royale'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its learning curve, gameplay, art style, and progression system, but noted its similarity to previous games in the genre. The game quickly rose in popularity following its release, eventually surpassing ''Battlegrounds'' in overall player count and revenue. By March 2019, the game had been played by over 250 million people and had generated over 2 billion dollars worldwide. The game has gone on to become a cultural phenomenon, with promotion through social media and several celebrities, including [[Ninja (streamer)|Ninja]], [[Marshmello]], and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], contributing to the game's popularity, achieving record-high viewership on streaming websites in the process.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Building in fortnite.jpg|left|thumb|The player can build structures as defense or buildings]]\nThe main gameplay for ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' follows the standard format for the [[Battle royale game|battle royale genre]]. The game normally is played either with each player on their own, or in a squad of two to four players, with up to 100 players participating each round. The round starts with players, weaponless, skydiving from floating buses (\"Battle Bus\") then deploying a glider onto a region of land. The island's fixed layout includes several landmarks and locations (named in an [[Alliteration|alliterative fashion]], such as \"Lazy Lake\", \"Pleasant Park\", and \"Retail Row\") that are mostly [[ghost town]]s, while a random distribution of weapons, shields, and other combat support features can be found by searching buildings and other sites. The goal is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. When playing in solo modes, players are immediately eliminated when they exhaust their health, while in squad modes, downed players can crawl around while bleeding out; they can be eliminated immediately by an opponent or revived by a squadmate to help them up. Initially, when the game launched, eliminated players were out of the match, but starting with updates in April 2019, squadmates can attempt to revive a downed player at various \"Reboot vans\" scattered around the map, which are few and far between and in the open, making it a risk to respawn a squadmate.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/4/5/18297126/fortnite-squad-respawn-reboot-van | title = Fortnite introducing Apex Legends-style respawns in next patch | first = Austin | last = Goslin | date = April 5, 2019 | accessdate = April 5, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190405214147/https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/4/5/18297126/fortnite-squad-respawn-reboot-van | archive-date = April 5, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Over time, the game's safe zone (representing the [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] of a storm), decreases in size, and players caught outside the zone will take damage. This directs the surviving players into tighter spaces, forcing player encounters. Supply drops will spawn in random locations during a match, providing random weapons and items. Like in the original ''[[Fortnite: Save the World|Fortnite]]'' game, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' is primarily played in a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]].\n\n''Fortnite Battle Royale''{{'}}s primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system, which originated from the original ''Fortnite'' survival game. Nearly all objects in the environment can be [[Destructible environment|destroyed]] and harvested for materials (wood, stone, and metal), which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities, such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs, which can be used to help traverse the map, protect the player from gunfire, or slow down progression of other players.  Weaker pieces can be destroyed in a few hits, but can be built quickly, while stronger pieces can withstand more punishment, but take longer to build.\n\n[[File:Battling in fortnite.jpg|right|thumb|The game also revolves around players eliminating their opponents to be the last one standing]]\nThe game is [[free-to-play]], supported by [[microtransactions]] that allow players to buy \"Vinderbucks\", \"V-Bucks\" for short, the game's internal currency. V-Bucks are also shared with the main ''Fortnite: Save the World'' game, which offers players the opportunity to earn V-Bucks by completing missions or daily quests.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.usgamer.net/articles/fortnite-battle-royale-save-the-world-v-bucks-grinding | title = Fortnite's V-Bucks Currency is Another Battleground for a Community at Odds | first = Matt | last = Kim | date = March 1, 2018 | accessdate = March 22, 2018 | website = [[USGamer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180323031201/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/fortnite-battle-royale-save-the-world-v-bucks-grinding | archivedate = March 23, 2018}}</ref> V-Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player (characters, pickaxes, glider skins, back-wears, and [[emote]]s). The game is run in chapters with a number of seasons, each season lasting about 10 weeks each. Each season introduces an exclusive set of cosmetic items that can be obtained. These are offered through a dual-track [[battle pass]], which features a number of tiers that players climb through by earning experience through completing in-game objectives, while acquiring cosmetic rewards or other items in the process. Each player has access to the \"free\" track of the Battle Pass, which offers fewer cosmetics that can be earned by clearing multiple tiers, while players can also purchase the Pass' \"premium\" track with V-Bucks,<ref name=\"nymag\"/> which offers more challenges and grants prizes for every tier the player advances. Players can use V-Bucks to purchase tiers as well once they have bought the Battle Pass.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/16/17129578/fortnite-v-bucks-premium-battle-pass-tier-ranking-spend-money | title = Should you spend money on Fortnite? | first = Russ | last = Frushtick | date = March 16, 2018 | accessdate = March 20, 2018 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180320163503/https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/16/17129578/fortnite-v-bucks-premium-battle-pass-tier-ranking-spend-money | archivedate = March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince release, Epic Games has added more features, such as new weapon and items and makeshift vehicles such as shopping carts and [[golf cart]]s. Epic is also able to deploy [[hotfix]]es to the game to adjust aspects like weapon attributes and distribution, pushing these out in minutes if necessary should they or players discover critical issues or [[Glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]], as well as removing older or not well received items from the game in a process called \"vaulting\".<ref name=\"ign devvideo\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17489040/fortnite-shopping-cart-glitch-under-map-epic | title = Here's why Fortnite shopping carts are giving Epic Games such a big headache | first = Patrica | last = Hernandez | date = June 21, 2018 | accessdate = July 6, 2018 | website = [[The Verge]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180701155511/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17489040/fortnite-shopping-cart-glitch-under-map-epic | archive-date = July 1, 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref> With the release of Chapter 1 Season 7 and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' mode, an area of the map called The Block featured a rotating selection of user-made creations developed in 'Creative' mode and approved by Epic.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/6/18129738/fortnite-the-block-trailer-creative-mode-season-7-map-epic-games-tga-2018 | title = Epic Games announced The Block, a new Fortnite in-game community spotlight | first = Austen | last = Goslin | date = December 6, 2018 | accessdate = December 6, 2018 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181207072411/https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/6/18129738/fortnite-the-block-trailer-creative-mode-season-7-map-epic-games-tga-2018 | archive-date = December 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nPrior to September 2019, ''Fortnite'' did not have specialized matchmaking, outside of platform and regional limits. With an upcoming patch, the game will introduced skill-based matchmaking, based on internal metrics that judge a player's skill in the game.

It is a companion game to ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[survival game]] with construction elements. It was initially released in [[early access]] on September 26, 2017, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], followed by ports for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and the [[Nintendo Switch]] the following year.\n\nThe concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre: 100 players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players. Players can fight alone (Solo), with one additional player (Duos), or with a group of up to three others (Squads). As the match progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts, giving the players less and less room to work with. The last player or team alive wins the match. The main distinction from others in the genre is the game's construction elements, letting players build walls, obstacles, and other structures from collected resources to take cover from incoming fire or give one a strategic view advantage. ''Battle Royale'' uses a seasonal approach with [[battle pass]]es to introduce new character customization content in the game, as well as limited time events, some of which correspond with changes to the game map. Since its initial release, several other game modes have been introduced, including \"Playground\", which somewhat serves as a training mode.\n\nThe idea for ''Battle Royale'' arose following the release of ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'', a similar battle royale game that was highly successful, but was noted for its technical flaws. Originally released as part of the early access version of ''Save the World'', Epic later transitioned the game to a [[free-to-play]] model funded by [[microtransaction]]s. Following its rise in popularity, Epic split the development team, with one focusing on ''Battle Royale'' and the other on ''Save the World''.\n\n''Battle Royale'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its learning curve, gameplay, art style, and progression system, but noted its similarity to previous games in the genre. The game quickly rose in popularity following its release, eventually surpassing ''Battlegrounds'' in overall player count and revenue. By March 2019, the game had been played by over 250 million people and had generated over 2 billion dollars worldwide. The game has gone on to become a cultural phenomenon, with promotion through social media and several celebrities, including [[Ninja (streamer)|Ninja]], [[Marshmello]], and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], contributing to the game's popularity, achieving record-high viewership on streaming websites in the process.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Building in fortnite.jpg|left|thumb|The player can build structures as defense or buildings]]\nThe main gameplay for ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' follows the standard format for the [[Battle royale game|battle royale genre]]. The game normally is played either with each player on their own, or in a squad of two to four players, with up to 100 players participating each round. The round starts with players, weaponless, skydiving from floating buses (\"Battle Bus\") then deploying a glider onto a region of land. The island's fixed layout includes several landmarks and locations (named in an [[Alliteration|alliterative fashion]], such as \"Lazy Lake\", \"Pleasant Park\", and \"Retail Row\") that are mostly [[ghost town]]s, while a random distribution of weapons, shields, and other combat support features can be found by searching buildings and other sites. The goal is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. When playing in solo modes, players are immediately eliminated when they exhaust their health, while in squad modes, downed players can crawl around while bleeding out; they can be eliminated immediately by an opponent or revived by a squadmate to help them up. Initially, when the game launched, eliminated players were out of the match, but starting with updates in April 2019, squadmates can attempt to revive a downed player at various \"Reboot vans\" scattered around the map, which are few and far between and in the open, making it a risk to respawn a squadmate.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/4/5/18297126/fortnite-squad-respawn-reboot-van | title = Fortnite introducing Apex Legends-style respawns in next patch | first = Austin | last = Goslin | date = April 5, 2019 | accessdate = April 5, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190405214147/https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/4/5/18297126/fortnite-squad-respawn-reboot-van | archive-date = April 5, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Over time, the game's safe zone (representing the [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] of a storm), decreases in size, and players caught outside the zone will take damage. This directs the surviving players into tighter spaces, forcing player encounters. Supply drops will spawn in random locations during a match, providing random weapons and items. Like in the original ''[[Fortnite: Save the World|Fortnite]]'' game, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' is primarily played in a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]].\n\n''Fortnite Battle Royale''{{'}}s primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system, which originated from the original ''Fortnite'' survival game. Nearly all objects in the environment can be [[Destructible environment|destroyed]] and harvested for materials (wood, stone, and metal), which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities, such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs, which can be used to help traverse the map, protect the player from gunfire, or slow down progression of other players.  Weaker pieces can be destroyed in a few hits, but can be built quickly, while stronger pieces can withstand more punishment, but take longer to build.\n\n[[File:Battling in fortnite.jpg|right|thumb|The game also revolves around players eliminating their opponents to be the last one standing]]\nThe game is [[free-to-play]], supported by [[microtransactions]] that allow players to buy \"Vinderbucks\", \"V-Bucks\" for short, the game's internal currency. V-Bucks are also shared with the main ''Fortnite: Save the World'' game, which offers players the opportunity to earn V-Bucks by completing missions or daily quests.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.usgamer.net/articles/fortnite-battle-royale-save-the-world-v-bucks-grinding | title = Fortnite's V-Bucks Currency is Another Battleground for a Community at Odds | first = Matt | last = Kim | date = March 1, 2018 | accessdate = March 22, 2018 | website = [[USGamer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180323031201/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/fortnite-battle-royale-save-the-world-v-bucks-grinding | archivedate = March 23, 2018}}</ref> V-Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player (characters, pickaxes, glider skins, back-wears, and [[emote]]s). The game is run in chapters with a number of seasons, each season lasting about 10 weeks each. Each season introduces an exclusive set of cosmetic items that can be obtained. These are offered through a dual-track [[battle pass]], which features a number of tiers that players climb through by earning experience through completing in-game objectives, while acquiring cosmetic rewards or other items in the process. Each player has access to the \"free\" track of the Battle Pass, which offers fewer cosmetics that can be earned by clearing multiple tiers, while players can also purchase the Pass' \"premium\" track with V-Bucks,<ref name=\"nymag\"/> which offers more challenges and grants prizes for every tier the player advances. Players can use V-Bucks to purchase tiers as well once they have bought the Battle Pass.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/16/17129578/fortnite-v-bucks-premium-battle-pass-tier-ranking-spend-money | title = Should you spend money on Fortnite? | first = Russ | last = Frushtick | date = March 16, 2018 | accessdate = March 20, 2018 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180320163503/https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/16/17129578/fortnite-v-bucks-premium-battle-pass-tier-ranking-spend-money | archivedate = March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince release, Epic Games has added more features, such as new weapon and items and makeshift vehicles such as shopping carts and [[golf cart]]s. Epic is also able to deploy [[hotfix]]es to the game to adjust aspects like weapon attributes and distribution, pushing these out in minutes if necessary should they or players discover critical issues or [[Glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]], as well as removing older or not well received items from the game in a process called \"vaulting\".<ref name=\"ign devvideo\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17489040/fortnite-shopping-cart-glitch-under-map-epic | title = Here's why Fortnite shopping carts are giving Epic Games such a big headache | first = Patrica | last = Hernandez | date = June 21, 2018 | accessdate = July 6, 2018 | website = [[The Verge]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180701155511/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17489040/fortnite-shopping-cart-glitch-under-map-epic | archive-date = July 1, 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref> With the release of Chapter 1 Season 7 and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' mode, an area of the map called The Block featured a rotating selection of user-made creations developed in 'Creative' mode and approved by Epic.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/6/18129738/fortnite-the-block-trailer-creative-mode-season-7-map-epic-games-tga-2018 | title = Epic Games announced The Block, a new Fortnite in-game community spotlight | first = Austen | last = Goslin | date = December 6, 2018 | accessdate = December 6, 2018 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181207072411/https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/6/18129738/fortnite-the-block-trailer-creative-mode-season-7-map-epic-games-tga-2018 | archive-date = December 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nPrior to September 2019, ''Fortnite'' did not have specialized matchmaking, outside of platform and regional limits.
