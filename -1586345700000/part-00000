Kageyama is recognized nationally as one of the best setters, but he pushes his teammates harder than any of them think should take place. He calls Hinata useless and tries to prove up with continual blocks against him. However Hinata manages to score some points with his speed and route alterations.

The day after, Karasuno reunites with Nekoma, Fukur\u014ddani, and some other familiar faces at nationals.   \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 70 (10)\n| Title               = Battle Lines\n| TranslitTitle       = Sensen\n| NativeTitle         = \u6226\u7dda\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Toshiyuki Sone\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|13}}\n| ShortSummary        = After the opening ceremony, the team goes to warm up for their first match at another gymnasium.

As she ran to the station, she recalls her memories of when she first became the manager and her journey with the volleyball team. Kiyoko returns to the gym just in time with Hinata's bag that contains his shoes ahead of Karasuno's match against Tsubakihara Academy.\n\nJust like Coach Ukai expected, the process is much tougher than expected. Kageyama is having a hard time adjusting to his surroundings which is affecting Karasuno's first match against Tsubakihara Academy. The only thing his teammates can do is hold out until Kageyama recalibrates. Yamaguchi is switched in with Hinata as a pinch server and manages to change the momentum for Karasuno. Finally after trial and error, Kageyama and Hinata manage to successfully pull off their quick. The score is currently 13-15 with Tsubakihara in the lead.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 71 (11)\n| Title               = A Chance to Extend the Rally\n| TranslitTitle       = Tsunagareru chansu\n| NativeTitle         = \u7e4b\u304c\u308c\u308b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hitomi Ezoe<br>Masako Sat\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n| ShortSummary        = Former Karasuno members appear to cheer on the new team and are impressed by the growth of their old teammates as well as the abilities of the first years. Kageyama, in particular, is attracting a great deal of attention for his superior technique and sharp game sense. Meanwhile, Atsumu Miya observes the match and finds Kageyama a completely different player. He also takes an interest in Hinata. \n\nTsubakihara persevere and enters into a long rally with neither team willing to give up. Just when Tsubakihara seems to have broken through Karasuno's defenses, Hinata manages to keep the ball in play by receiving it with his chest, and Asahi follows up with a spike to even the score 18-18. Hinata is still having trouble finding the right position to receive, but his improvements are becoming noticeable to his teammates. Moreover, it's not just Hinata, the whole team has grown immensely. \n\nTsubakihara's Himekawa is switched in as a pinch server at a crucial moment for Tsubakihara. Under pressure, Himekawa accidentally serves the ball into Teradomari's head. This gives Karasuno the last point needed to win the set.  The second set begins and eventually ends with Karasuno in the lead 15-14. Himekawa is switched in once again, but this time he successfully pulls off a ceiling serve, which sends the ball high into the ceiling by using a underhand serve. Daichi completely misses the ball because of the gymnasium lights, allowing Tsubakihara to regain some momentum.\n\nKarasuno initially struggles with the serve, but they soon adapt and halt Tsubakihara's momentum. Karasuno refuses to be left behind as they gradually make their comeback. The game continues in a intense rally with both teams scoring back and forth. With the score at 23-23, Karasuno makes a miscoordination but Daichi saves it just in time to put his team at match point. For the last play, Sugawara joins the match as the pinch server, aiming to cause a disarray in their opponents formation. Both teams are refusing to give in, keeping up a good rally. Maruyama spikes the ball and it ricochets off the blockers but Sugawara covers it. The match ends with a finishing blow from Karasuno's ace, Asahi! Karasuno moves on to the second round!\n\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 72 (12)\n| Title               = Vivid\n| TranslitTitle       = Senretsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u9bae\u70c8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hideya It\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n| ShortSummary        = Karasuno has won their first match at nationals and will be moving on to the second round.

Nekoma wins their first match at nationals as well and will be moving on to the second round. \n\nMeanwhile on Court E, Fukur\u014ddani is just starting their first match against Eiwa and Bokuto is already in \"dejected mode\". However, the team is well-adapted and knows what to do while waiting for Bokuto to get over his slump. Once Bokuto regain his composure, he leads Fukur\u014ddani to an overwhelming victory over Eiwa. \n\nHinata, together with Yamaguchi, runs into Hoshiumi and immediately enters into a staring competition. Kageyama appears to introduce him as Kourai Hoshiumi, a member of the National Training Youth Camp. Hoshiumi questions Hinata about his position, height, and highest reaching point. Eventually Hoshiumi's teammate comes to get him, and the leave to get ready for their match. Karasuno members watch Hoshiumi's team, Kamomedai, and are amazed by his skill. Hoshiumi shows off his all-rounder prowess, leading the game commentators to call him the \"Small Giant\". Hinata is inspired by Hoshiumi's play and is glad they made it to nationals.\n\nIt is the end of the first day of the Spring Interhigh. Before Karasuno heads back to their lodging, they encounter their fated rival Nekoma. They greet each other with Daichi and Kuroo reminding the other to survive the next day before heading their own ways. Karasuno gets some much needed rest after an intense day before the team starts preparing for their next opponent. Meanwhile, Tanaka finally gets the chance to talk with his childhood friend, Kanoka Amanai. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 73 (13)\n| Title               = Day Two\n| TranslitTitle       = Futsuka-me\n| NativeTitle         = 2\u65e5\u76ee\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yumi Kamakura\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|3}}\n| ShortSummary        = The night before the second day of nationals, Karasuno prepares to play against their next opponent.

Karasuno quickly realize they are in for an incredibly tough match, but things get worse when they find out that one of Atsumu Miya's teammates is his twin brother, Osamu. \n\nTime is drawing closer to Karasuno and Inarizaki's match, and many are anticipating a solid performance from the powerhouse Inarizaki. Tanaka runs into Kanoka to clear up the misunderstanding with her cousin from last night. In the sub-arena, Karasuno warm up in preparation. The team finds out about the popularity of their opponents as they step on the court to deafening cheers from Inarizaki supporters. \n\nThe match between Karasuno and Inarizaki finally begins. Miya Atsumu starts off with his powerful serves, but not before he silences the cheering crowd, as he requires absolute silence to concentrate and is annoyed at even the slightest disturbance. However, when it comes to Karasuno's turn to serve, the Inarizaki cheering squad starts booing and heckling their opponents. As the game continues, Hinata manages to jump higher than he ever had before, but gets so completely caught up in the jump itself that he forgets to spike the ball. Although he receives some harsh words from Kageyama, Inarizaki players are impressed by this jump, as well as surprised that he was experimenting at a time like this, and all set their eyes on Hinata.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber        = 74 (14)\n| Title               = Challengers\n| TranslitTitle       = Ch\u014dsensha\n| NativeTitle         = \u6311\u6226\u8005\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|7|}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 75 (15)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 76 (16)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 77 (17)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 78 (18)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 79 (19)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 80 (20)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 81 (21)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 82 (22)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 83 (23)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 84 (24)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 85 (25)\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| OriginalAirDate     = \n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Haikyu!! chapters|List of ''Haikyu!!'' chapters]]\n*[[List of Haikyu!! characters|List of ''Haikyu!!'' characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Haikyu!!'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haiky\u016b}}\n\n{{Haikyu!!}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Nihongo|'''''[[Haikyu!!]]'''''|\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc!!}} is a Japanese [[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] [[manga]] series written and illustrated by Haruichi Furudate that revolves around a high school volleyball team and the relationship between players Hinata Sh\u014dy\u014d and Kageyama Tobio.

Kageyama is recognized nationally as one of the best setters, but he pushes his teammates harder than any of them think should take place. He calls Hinata useless and tries to prove up with continual blocks against him. However Hinata manages to score some points with his speed and route alterations.

Eventually Hoshiumi's teammate comes to get him, and the leave to get ready for their match. Karasuno members watch Hoshiumi's team, Kamomedai, and are amazed by his skill. Hoshiumi shows off his all-rounder prowess, leading the game commentators to call him the \"Small Giant\". Hinata is inspired by Hoshiumi's play and is glad they made it to nationals.\n\nIt is the end of the first day of the Spring Interhigh. Before Karasuno heads back to their lodging, they encounter their fated rival Nekoma. They greet each other with Daichi and Kuroo reminding the other to survive the next day before heading their own ways.

Tanaka runs into Kanoka to clear up the misunderstanding with her cousin from last night. In the sub-arena, Karasuno warm up in preparation. The team finds out about the popularity of their opponents as they step on the court to deafening cheers from Inarizaki supporters. \n\nThe match between Karasuno and Inarizaki finally begins. Miya Atsumu starts off with his powerful serves, but not before he silences the cheering crowd, as he requires absolute silence to concentrate and is annoyed at even the slightest disturbance. However, when it comes to Karasuno's turn to serve, the Inarizaki cheering squad starts booing and heckling their opponents.

The wax is formed into scales by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of [[worker bee]]s, which discard it in or at the hive.  The hive workers collect and use it to form cells for honey storage and larval and pupal protection within the [[beehive]].  Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of [[ester]]s of [[fatty acids]] and various [[fatty alcohol|long-chain alcohols]].\n\nBeeswax has been used since prehistory as the first plastic, as a lubricant and waterproofing agent, in [[lost wax casting]] of metals and glass, as a [[wood finishing|polish]] for wood and leather and for making [[candles]], as an ingredient in cosmetics and as an artistic medium in [[encaustic painting]]. \n\nBeeswax is edible, having similar negligible [[toxicity]] to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and in the [[European Union]] under the [[E number]] E901.\n\n==Production==\nThe wax is formed by [[worker bee]]s, which secrete it from eight wax-producing mirror glands on the inner sides of the [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] (the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] shield or plate of each segment of the body) on abdominal segments 4 to 7.<ref name=Sanford>{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=M.T.|last2=Dietz|first2=A.|year=1976|title=The fine structure of the wax gland of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.).|journal=Apidologie|volume=7|issue=3|pages=197\u2013207|doi=10.1051/apido:19760301|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00890403/file/hal-00890403.pdf}}</ref> The sizes of these wax glands depend on the age of the worker, and after many daily flights, these glands gradually begin to [[atrophy]].\n\nThe new wax is initially glass-clear and colorless, becoming [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] after [[chewing]] and being contaminated with pollen by the hive worker bees, becoming progressively yellower or browner by incorporation of [[pollen]] oils and [[propolis]].  The wax scales are about {{convert|3|mm|in|spell=in}} across and {{convert|0.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and about 1100 are needed to make a gram of wax.<ref>Brown, R, H.

Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, and the type of flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the [[brood comb]] of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called [[slumgum]].\n\nThe wax may be clarified further by heating in water. As with petroleum waxes, it may be softened by dilution with mineral oil or vegetable oil to make it more workable at room temperature.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nBeeswax is a tough [[wax]] formed from a mixture of several [[chemical compound]]s.\n[[File:Triacontanyl palmitate.png|thumb|440px|left|Triacontanyl palmitate, a [[wax ester]], is a major component of beeswax.]]\n{| style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Wax content type||Percentage\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|[[Hydrocarbon]]s||14%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Mono[[ester]]s||35%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Diesters||14%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Triesters||3%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Hydroxy monoesters||4%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Hydroxy polyesters||8%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Acid [[ester]]s ||1%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Acid [[polyester]]s||2%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|[[Fatty acid|Free fatty acid]]s||12%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|[[Fatty alcohol|Free fatty alcohol]]s ||1%\n|-\n| style=\"background:gainsboro;\"|Unidentified||6%\n|}\n\nAn approximate [[structural formula|chemical formula]] for beeswax is C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>31</sub>COOC<sub>30</sub>H<sub>61</sub>.<ref>{{cite book |last=Umney |first=Nick |author2=Shayne Rivers |title=Conservation of Furniture |year=2003 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |page=164}}</ref> Its main constituents are [[palmitate]], [[Palmitoleic acid|palmitoleate]], and [[oleic acid|oleate]] [[ester]]s of long-chain (30\u201332 carbons) [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[alcohol]]s, with the ratio of [[palmitate|triacontanyl palmitate]] CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>29</sub>O-CO-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>14</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> to [[cerotic acid]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/get_lm_lipids_dbgif.php?LM_ID=LMFA01010026 |title=LIPID MAPS Databases : LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway |publisher=Lipidmaps.org |accessdate=2013-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051430/http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/get_lm_lipids_dbgif.php?LM_ID=LMFA01010026 |archive-date=2014-06-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>24</sub>COOH, the two principal constituents, being 6:1.

The three main types of beeswax products are yellow, white, and beeswax absolute. Yellow beeswax is the crude product obtained from the honeycomb, white beeswax is bleached or filtered yellow beeswax, and beeswax [[Absolute (perfumery)|absolute]] is yellow beeswax treated with alcohol. In food preparation, it is used as a coating for cheese; by sealing out the air, protection is given against spoilage (mold growth). Beeswax may also be used as a food additive [[E number|E901]], in small quantities acting as a [[glazing agent]], which serves to prevent water loss, or used to provide surface protection for some fruits. Soft gelatin capsules and tablet coatings may also use E901. Beeswax is also a common ingredient of natural chewing gum.

The wax is formed into scales by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of [[worker bee]]s, which discard it in or at the hive.  The hive workers collect and use it to form cells for honey storage and larval and pupal protection within the [[beehive]].  Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of [[ester]]s of [[fatty acids]] and various [[fatty alcohol|long-chain alcohols]].\n\nBeeswax has been used since prehistory as the first plastic, as a lubricant and waterproofing agent, in [[lost wax casting]] of metals and glass, as a [[wood finishing|polish]] for wood and leather and for making [[candles]], as an ingredient in cosmetics and as an artistic medium in [[encaustic painting]]. \n\nBeeswax is edible, having similar negligible [[toxicity]] to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and in the [[European Union]] under the [[E number]] E901.\n\n==Production==\nThe wax is formed by [[worker bee]]s, which secrete it from eight wax-producing mirror glands on the inner sides of the [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] (the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] shield or plate of each segment of the body) on abdominal segments 4 to 7.<ref name=Sanford>{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=M.T.|last2=Dietz|first2=A.|year=1976|title=The fine structure of the wax gland of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.).|journal=Apidologie|volume=7|issue=3|pages=197\u2013207|doi=10.1051/apido:19760301|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00890403/file/hal-00890403.pdf}}</ref> The sizes of these wax glands depend on the age of the worker, and after many daily flights, these glands gradually begin to [[atrophy]].\n\nThe new wax is initially glass-clear and colorless, becoming [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] after [[chewing]] and being contaminated with pollen by the hive worker bees, becoming progressively yellower or browner by incorporation of [[pollen]] oils and [[propolis]].

Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, and the type of flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the [[brood comb]] of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called [[slumgum]].\n\nThe wax may be clarified further by heating in water.

{"title_page": "Lovers Made Men", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2012}}\n'''''Lovers Made Men,''''' alternatively titled '''''The Masque of Lethe''''' or '''''The Masque at Lord Hay's,''''' was a [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era [[masque]], written by [[Ben Jonson]], designed by [[Inigo Jones]], and with music composed by [[Nicholas Lanier]]. It was performed on Saturday 22 February [[1617 in literature|1617]], and was significant in the development and acceptance of [[opera]] in seventeenth-century England.\n\n==Background==\nThe Lord Hay in question was [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], one of the early favorites of King [[James I of England|James I]]. Through 1616 Hay had been involved in a major diplomatic embassy to the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] in Paris, where Hay had negotiated a potential marriage between James's son and heir Prince Charles, the future [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and a daughter of the French king. (The negotiations were not fruitful in 1616, though a decade later Charles would marry Henri's daughter [[Henrietta Maria of France]].) Hay's embassy was characterized by extraordinary lavish banquets, masques, processions and shows of all types &mdash; a pattern of indulgence that continued when Hay returned to Britain. ''Lovers Made Men'' was one of the shows of this period; Lord Hay used it to welcome and entertain the French Ambassador, the [[Charles Cauchon de Maupas|Baron de Tour]]. The performance of the masque was organized for Lord Hay by Jonson's patron [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford]].\n\n==The show==\nAs the subtitle of the work indicates, Jonson set his masque on the shores of the river [[Lethe]] in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] of ancient [[Greek mythology]]. As the masque begins, [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] the ferryman has just dropped off a group of human figures, \"imagined ghosts,\" to be received by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The [[Moirai|Fates]], however, complain that these people are not actually dead; they have been deluded through the influence of [[Cupid]] to think that they have \"drown'd in Love.\" By drinking the waters of Lethe, the deluded lovers paradoxically forget their Cupid-imposed delusions and return to mental health. Thus the lovers are \"made men\" once again.\n\nThe masque is a relatively brief work, and featured only a single perspective stage set; by Inigo Jones's standards of masque design, it was a fairly spare production.\n\nJonson's masque ends with a reconciliation of love and wisdom.

It was performed on Saturday 22 February [[1617 in literature|1617]], and was significant in the development and acceptance of [[opera]] in seventeenth-century England.\n\n==Background==\nThe Lord Hay in question was [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], one of the early favorites of King [[James I of England|James I]]. Through 1616 Hay had been involved in a major diplomatic embassy to the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] in Paris, where Hay had negotiated a potential marriage between James's son and heir Prince Charles, the future [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and a daughter of the French king. (The negotiations were not fruitful in 1616, though a decade later Charles would marry Henri's daughter [[Henrietta Maria of France]].) Hay's embassy was characterized by extraordinary lavish banquets, masques, processions and shows of all types &mdash; a pattern of indulgence that continued when Hay returned to Britain. ''Lovers Made Men'' was one of the shows of this period; Lord Hay used it to welcome and entertain the French Ambassador, the Baron de Tour. The performance of the masque was organized for Lord Hay by Jonson's patron [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford]].\n\n==The show==\nAs the subtitle of the work indicates, Jonson set his masque on the shores of the river [[Lethe]] in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] of ancient [[Greek mythology]]. As the masque begins, [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] the ferryman has just dropped off a group of human figures, \"imagined ghosts,\" to be received by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The [[Moirai|Fates]], however, complain that these people are not actually dead; they have been deluded through the influence of [[Cupid]] to think that they have \"drown'd in Love.\" By drinking the waters of Lethe, the deluded lovers paradoxically forget their Cupid-imposed delusions and return to mental health. Thus the lovers are \"made men\" once again.\n\nThe masque is a relatively brief work, and featured only a single perspective stage set; by Inigo Jones's standards of masque design, it was a fairly spare production.\n\nJonson's masque ends with a reconciliation of love and wisdom. Another masque writer, Robert White, took a different tack in his ''Cupid's Banishment,'' produced later in 1617; in his work, as the title indicates, Cupid is regarded as too disruptive an influence to be accepted. Jonson in turn may have answered White's masque in his ''[[Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue]]'' ([[1618 in literature|1618]]).<ref>Robert C.

He was the first non congress chief minister of Assam. Borbora was a member of [[Rajya Sabha]] between 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Golaghat]] and had his early schooling in [[Tinsukia]] and then studied at the [[University of Calcutta]]. His parents were Komol Borbora (an executive officer from Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Digboi) and Puniyaprova Borbora. His father later left his job due to official issues (a long strike in the company).

However, many think that the government did not last long as he had tried to stop influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring countries and also to demonopolize the liquor trade in tea garden belts. His government exempted land revenue for farmers up to 10 bighas and ordered fee exemptions to school students up to HSLC level and all girls up to high school level.

The [[Corps of Royal Engineers]] is still based in Chatham at [[Brompton Barracks]]. \n\nThe Dockyard closed in 1984, but the remaining major naval buildings are an attraction for a flourishing tourist industry. Following closure, part of the site was developed as a commercial port, other parts were redeveloped for business and residential use, and part was used as the [[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] museum. Its attractions include the submarine {{HMS|Ocelot|S17|6}}. \n\nThe town has important road links and the [[Chatham railway station|railway]] and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area.  It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping centre.\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Chatham'' was first recorded as ''Cetham'' in 880 AD.  The [[Domesday Book]] records the place as ''Ceteham''.\n\nMost books explain this name as a British root ''ceto'' (like Welsh ''coed''), plus Old English ''ham'', meaning a forest settlement.<ref name=mills>A. D. Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names'', 2003, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-852758-6}}</ref><ref name=glover>Judith Glover, ''The Place Names of Kent'', 1976, Batsford. {{ISBN|0-905270-61-4}}</ref>\nThe river-valley site of Chatham is, however, more consistent with ''cet'' being an Old English survival of the element ''catu'', that was common in Roman-era names and meant 'basin' or 'valley'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proto-english.org/catu.pdf|title=Was Catu- really Celtic for battle?|author=|date=|website=proto-english.org}}</ref>\n\nThe [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]] passes by Chatham along the line of the ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] route. It was paved by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and named [[Watling Street]] by the Anglo-Saxons. Among archeological finds here have been the remains of a Roman-era cemetery.\n\nChatham was long a small village on the banks of the river. By the 16th century, warships were being moored at Jillingham water ([[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]]), because of its strategic sheltered location between London and the Continent. It was established as a Royal Dockyard by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1568, and most of the dockyard lies within Gillingham. Initially a refitting base, it became a shipbuilding yard; from then until the late 19th century, further expansion of the yard took place. In its time, many thousands of men were employed at the dockyard, and many hundreds of vessels were launched there, including ''[[HMS Victory]],'' which was built there in the 1760s. After [[World War I]], many [[submarine]]s were also built in Chatham Dockyard.\n\n[[File:ChathamMedway2654.JPG|thumb|right|Looking from the river at Sun Pier along the Great Barrier Ditch, to the Gun Platforms at Fort Amherst]]\nIn addition to the dockyard, defensive fortifications were built to protect it from attack. [[Upnor Castle]] had been built in 1567, but had proved ineffectual; the Dutch [[raid on the Medway]] in 1667 showed that more defenses were required. The fortifications, which became more elaborate as the threat of invasion grew, were begun in 1756 as a complex across the neck of the peninsula formed by the bend in the River Medway, and included [[Fort Amherst]]. The threat of a land-based attack from the south during the 19th century led to the construction of more forts.\n\nThe second phase of fort-building (1806\u20131819) included [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]] (later used as a hospital and the site of the first Army Medical School). The 1859 [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] ordered, ''inter alia'', a third outer ring of forts: these included [[Fort Luton]],<ref>Now a heritage site</ref> [[Fort Bridgewood]], and [[Fort Borstal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/chatham.html|title=Fortified Places > Fortresses > Chatham|author=|date=|website=www.fortified-places.com}}</ref> \n\nThese fortifications all required military personnel to man them and Army barracks to house those men. These included Kitchener Barracks (c 1750\u20131780), the [[Royal Marine Barracks, Chatham|Royal Marine Barracks]] (c 1780), [[Royal School of Military Engineering|Brompton Artillery Barracks]] (1806)<ref>Although the postal address of Brompton Barracks (now the headquarters of the [[Royal Engineers]]) indicates Chatham as its location, Brompton village lies in Gillingham</ref> and Melville Barracks (opened 1820 as a Naval hospital, RM barracks from 1905).<ref>{{cite web|title=Medway lines website|url=http://www.medwaylines.com/medwaymaritimehospital.htm}}</ref> H.M.S. Collingwood and H.M.S. Pembroke were both naval barracks.\n\nIn response to the huge manpower needs, the village of Chatham and other nearby villages and towns grew commensurately. [[Chatham and District Light Railways Company|Trams]], and later buses, linked those places to bring in the workforce.<ref name=\"trams\">{{cite book| author=Harley, Robert J.| year=1994| title=Maidstone and Chatham Tramways| publisher=Middleton Press|isbn=1-873793-40-5}}</ref> The area between the High Street and Luton village illustrates part of that growth, with its many streets of Victorian terraces.\n\nThe importance of Chatham dockyard gradually declined as Britain's naval resources were reduced or moved to other locations, and eventually, in 1984, it was closed completely. The dockyard buildings were preserved as the historic site [[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] (operated by Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chdt.org.uk/|title=The Historic Dockyard Chatham \u2013 Your Big Day Out in Kent|author=|date=|website=Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust}}</ref>), which was under consideration as a [[World Heritage Site]]<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web | title= Chatham Naval Dockyard| url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1309/ | publisher = UNESCO |accessdate = 21 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Sam | last=Masters |date=9 January 2014 |title=Chatham dockyard's bid for Unesco World Heritage Site status is blocked  | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chatham-dockyards-bid-for-unesco-world-heritage-site-status-is-blocked-9049750.html |work=The Independent |accessdate=17 November 2014}}</ref> the site is being used for other purposes.

This gives the right bank, where the town stands, considerable advantages from the point of view of river use. Compared with opposite bank, the river is fast-flowing and deep; the illustration (1), an early print of the settlement, is taken from the point where Fort Pitt now stands. The town lies below at river level, curving round to occupy a south-easterly trending valley (The Brook\"), in which lies the High Street. Beyond the dockyard was marshy land, now called St Mary's Island, and has several new developments of housing estates. The New Road crosses the scene below the vantage point of the illustration.\n\nIllustration (2) is taken from the opposite side of the valley: the Pentagon Centre is to the right, with the building on the ridge left of centre, Fort Pitt and Rochester lies beyond that ridge; and [[Frindsbury]] is on the rising ground in the right distance.\n\nThe valley continues southeastwards as the Luton Valley, in which is the erstwhile village of that name; and Capstone Valley. The ''Darland Banks'', the northern slopes of the valley above these valleys, are unimproved chalk grassland.

Stone, timber and iron from the [[Weald]] for shipbuilding and agricultural produce were among the cargoes. Sun Pier in Chatham was one of many such along the river. By 1740, barges of forty tons could navigate as far upstream as [[Tonbridge]].<ref name=\"KHI\">{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=Frank W.|title =Kent History Illustrated |publisher = Kent County Council| year = 1966}}</ref> Today its use is confined to tourist traffic; apart from the marina, there are many yacht moorings on the river itself.\n\nChatham's position on the road network began with the building of the Roman road ([[Watling Street]], which passed through the town. [[Turnpike trust]]s were established locally, so that the length from Chatham to [[Canterbury]] was [[toll road|turnpiked]] in 1730; and the Chatham to Maidstone road (now the [[A230 road|A230]]) was also turnpiked before 1750. The High Street was bypassed in 1769, by the ''New Road'' (see illustration (1)) leading from the top of Star Hill Rochester, to the bottom of Chatham Hill at Luton Arches. This also became inadequate for the London cross-channel traffic and the ''Medway Towns Bypass'', the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]], was constructed to divert through traffic south of the Medway Towns.\n\nChatham is the hub of the Medway Towns. This fact means that the existing road system has always proved inadequate for the amount of traffic it has to handle, and various schemes have been tried to alleviate the congestion. The High Street itself is traffic-free, so all traffic has to skirt around it. The basic west-east routes are The Brook to the north and New Road to the south, but the additional problems caused by the situation of the Pentagon Bus Station meant that conflicting traffic flows were the result. In the 1980s the Chatham town centre was remodelled and an inner ring road \u2013 a one-way system \u2013 was constructed. This was completed with the construction of the ''Sir John Hawkins Flyover'' opened in 1989 carrying the south to north traffic over the High Street.\n\nIn September 2006, the one-way system was abandoned and two-way traffic reintroduced on most of the ring-road system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2006/09/13/chatham_two_way_feature.shtml |title=Chatham two way |publisher=BBC |year=2006 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> Further work on the road system commenced early in 2009, and as of early 2010, the demolition of the ''Sir John Hawkins Flyover'' has been completed.

In the period from 1977 until 1982 the Medway Delta Sound emerged. The term was coined as a joke by Chatham born writer painter and musician [[Billy Childish]] after Russ Wilkins' Medway based record label, Empire Records, used the phrase \"from the Medway Delta\". Several Medway Delta bands gained international recognition, including [[The Milkshakes]], [[The Prisoners]] (see also [[James Taylor Quartet]]) and [[The Dentists]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOut of the [[Kent Institute of Art & Design]] (KIAD), now the [[University for the Creative Arts]] (UCA) came the band known as [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]]. The vocalist and guitarist with Wang Chung, Jeremy Ryder, who is better known as [[Jack Hues]] attended KIAD. Also Alan Denman, who was a well established lecturer at KIAD formed the Electronic Town as an urban theatre movement in the [[Medway Towns]] in 1984. Alan Denman also helped to form [[The Medway Poets]] with [[Billy Childish]], Robert Earl, [[Bill Lewis]], [[Sexton Ming]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]. The Medway Poets used to meet regularly at the Railway Tavern that was known as The York during the period from 1974 to 1985 in Ordnance Street in Chatham. Chatham has had a strong musical and creative arts heritage that was centred on local groups, many of which were part of KIAD. Charles Thomson and Billy Childish went on to create the artistic movement known as [[Stuckism]] in 1999.<ref name=milner7>[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Thomson, Charles]] (August 2004), \"A Stuckist on Stuckism: Stella Vine\", from: Ed.

The spirit of the original greatness of the Medway Delta Sound was revived by music and poetry evenings promoted by David Wise's Urban Fox Press, which also published several books by Medway poets and artists. In 2008. the independent arts organisation Medway Eyes was founded, specialising in music and photography. It had promoted several arts exhibitions and gigs at The Barge in Gillingham (now closed) and The Nags Head in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], but then in 2013 it disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medway Eyes|url=https://medwayeyes.wordpress.com/|publisher=wordpress.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[The Medway Poets]] were formed in 1977 and disbanded in 1982 having performed at major literary festivals and on TV and Radio.

It was paved by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and named [[Watling Street]] by the Anglo-Saxons. Among archeological finds here have been the remains of a Roman-era cemetery.\n\nChatham was long a small village on the banks of the river. By the 16th century, warships were being moored at Jillingham water ([[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]]), because of its strategic sheltered location between London and the Continent. It was established as a Royal Dockyard by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1568, and most of the dockyard lies within Gillingham. Initially a refitting base, it became a shipbuilding yard; from then until the late 19th century, further expansion of the yard took place. In its time, many thousands of men were employed at the dockyard, and many hundreds of vessels were launched there, including ''[[HMS Victory]],'' which was built there in the 1760s. After [[World War I]], many [[submarine]]s were also built in Chatham Dockyard.\n\n[[File:ChathamMedway2654.JPG|thumb|right|Looking from the river at Sun Pier along the Great Barrier Ditch, to the Gun Platforms at Fort Amherst]]\nIn addition to the dockyard, defensive fortifications were built to protect it from attack. [[Upnor Castle]] had been built in 1567, but had proved ineffectual; the Dutch [[raid on the Medway]] in 1667 showed that more defenses were required. The fortifications, which became more elaborate as the threat of invasion grew, were begun in 1756 as a complex across the neck of the peninsula formed by the bend in the River Medway, and included [[Fort Amherst]]. The threat of a land-based attack from the south during the 19th century led to the construction of more forts.\n\nThe second phase of fort-building (1806\u20131819) included [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]] (later used as a hospital and the site of the first Army Medical School). The 1859 [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] ordered, ''inter alia'', a third outer ring of forts: these included [[Fort Luton]],<ref>Now a heritage site</ref> [[Fort Bridgewood]], and [[Fort Borstal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/chatham.html|title=Fortified Places > Fortresses > Chatham|author=|date=|website=www.fortified-places.com}}</ref> \n\nThese fortifications all required military personnel to man them and Army barracks to house those men. These included Kitchener Barracks (c 1750\u20131780), the [[Royal Marine Barracks, Chatham|Royal Marine Barracks]] (c 1780), [[Royal School of Military Engineering|Brompton Artillery Barracks]] (1806)<ref>Although the postal address of Brompton Barracks (now the headquarters of the [[Royal Engineers]]) indicates Chatham as its location, Brompton village lies in Gillingham</ref> and Melville Barracks (opened 1820 as a Naval hospital, RM barracks from 1905).<ref>{{cite web|title=Medway lines website|url=http://www.medwaylines.com/medwaymaritimehospital.htm}}</ref> H.M.S. Collingwood and H.M.S. Pembroke were both naval barracks.\n\nIn response to the huge manpower buildup, the village of Chatham and other nearby villages and towns grew commensurately. [[Chatham and District Light Railways Company|Trams]], and later buses, linked those places to bring in the workforce.<ref name=\"trams\">{{cite book| author=Harley, Robert J.| year=1994| title=Maidstone and Chatham Tramways| publisher=Middleton Press|isbn=1-873793-40-5}}</ref> The area between the High Street and Luton village illustrates part of that growth, with its many streets of Victorian terraces.\n\nThe importance of Chatham dockyard gradually declined as Britain's naval resources were reduced or moved to other locations, and eventually, in 1984, it was closed completely. The dockyard buildings were preserved as the historic site [[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] (operated by Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chdt.org.uk/|title=The Historic Dockyard Chatham \u2013 Your Big Day Out in Kent|author=|date=|website=Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust}}</ref>), which was under consideration as a [[World Heritage Site]]<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web | title= Chatham Naval Dockyard| url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1309/ | publisher = UNESCO |accessdate = 21 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Sam | last=Masters |date=9 January 2014 |title=Chatham dockyard's bid for Unesco World Heritage Site status is blocked  | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chatham-dockyards-bid-for-unesco-world-heritage-site-status-is-blocked-9049750.html |work=The Independent |accessdate=17 November 2014}}</ref> the site is being used for other purposes.

This gives the right bank, where the town stands, considerable advantages from the point of view of river use. Compared with opposite bank, the river is fast-flowing and deep; the illustration (1), an early print of the settlement, is taken from the point where Fort Pitt now stands. The town lies below at river level, curving round to occupy a south-easterly trending valley (The Brook\"), in which lies the High Street. Beyond the dockyard was marshy land, now called St Mary's Island, and has several new developments of housing estates. The New Road crosses the scene below the vantage point of the illustration.\n\nIllustration (2) is taken from the opposite side of the valley: the Pentagon Centre is to the right, with the building on the ridge left of centre, Fort Pitt and Rochester lies beyond that ridge; and [[Frindsbury]] is on the rising ground in the right distance.\n\nThe valley continues southeastwards as the Luton Valley, in which is the erstwhile village of that name; and Capstone Valley. The ''Darland Banks'', the northern slopes of the valley above these valleys, are unimproved chalk grassland. The photograph (3), taken from the Banks and looking south, shows the village in the centre, with the rows of Victorian terraced housing, which unusually follow the contour lines. The opposite slopes are the \u2018\u2019Daisy Banks'\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Coney Banks'\u2019, along which some of the defensive forts were built (including Fort Luton, in the trees to the left)\n\nUntil the start of the 20th century, most of the south part of the borough was entirely rural, with a number of farms and large tracts of woodland. The beginning of what is now [[Walderslade]] was when a speculative builder began to build the core of the village in ''Walderslade Bottoms''.<ref>[http://www.walderslade.kevinarrowsmith.co.uk/localhistory.php Walderslade Online: ''A Short History of Walderslade Village''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225195848/http://www.walderslade.kevinarrowsmith.co.uk/localhistory.php |date=25 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nChatham became a market town in its own right in the 19th century, and a [[municipal borough]] in 1890.

By 1961 it had reached 48,800.<ref name=\"KHI\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nThe closure of the Dockyard has had the effect of changing the employment statistics of the town. About 7000 people lost their jobs.

Stone, timber and iron from the [[Weald]] for shipbuilding and agricultural produce were among the cargoes. Sun Pier in Chatham was one of many such along the river. By 1740, barges of forty tons could navigate as far upstream as [[Tonbridge]].<ref name=\"KHI\">{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=Frank W.|title =Kent History Illustrated |publisher = Kent County Council| year = 1966}}</ref> Today its use is confined to tourist traffic; apart from the marina, there are many yacht moorings on the river itself.\n\nChatham's position on the road network began with the building of the Roman road ([[Watling Street]], which passed through the town. [[Turnpike trust]]s were established locally, so that the length from Chatham to [[Canterbury]] was [[toll road|turnpiked]] in 1730; and the Chatham to Maidstone road (now the [[A230 road|A230]]) was also turnpiked before 1750. The High Street was bypassed in 1769, by the ''New Road'' (see illustration (1)) leading from the top of Star Hill Rochester, to the bottom of Chatham Hill at Luton Arches. This also became inadequate for the London cross-channel traffic and the ''Medway Towns Bypass'', the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]], was constructed to divert through traffic south of the Medway Towns.\n\nChatham is the hub of the Medway Towns. This fact means that the existing road system has always proved inadequate for the amount of traffic it has to handle, and various schemes have been tried to alleviate the congestion. The High Street itself is traffic-free, so all traffic has to skirt around it. The basic west-east routes are The Brook to the north and New Road to the south, but the additional problems caused by the situation of the Pentagon Bus Station meant that conflicting traffic flows were the result. In the 1980s the Chatham town centre was remodelled and an inner ring road \u2013 a one-way system \u2013 was constructed. This was completed with the construction of the ''Sir John Hawkins Flyover'' opened in 1989 carrying the south to north traffic over the High Street.\n\nIn September 2006, the one-way system was abandoned and two-way traffic reintroduced on most of the ring-road system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2006/09/13/chatham_two_way_feature.shtml |title=Chatham two way |publisher=BBC |year=2006 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> Further work on the road system commenced early in 2009, and as of early 2010, the demolition of the ''Sir John Hawkins Flyover'' has been completed.

In the period from 1977 until 1982 the Medway Delta Sound emerged. The term was coined as a joke by Chatham born writer painter and musician [[Billy Childish]] after Russ Wilkins' Medway based record label, Empire Records, used the phrase \"from the Medway Delta\". Several Medway Delta bands gained international recognition, including [[The Milkshakes]], [[The Prisoners]] (see also [[James Taylor Quartet]]) and [[The Dentists]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOut of the [[Kent Institute of Art & Design]] (KIAD), now the [[University for the Creative Arts]] (UCA) came the band known as [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]]. The vocalist and guitarist with Wang Chung, Jeremy Ryder, who is better known as [[Jack Hues]] attended KIAD. Also Alan Denman, who was a well established lecturer at KIAD formed the Electronic Town as an urban theatre movement in the [[Medway Towns]] in 1984. Alan Denman also helped to form [[The Medway Poets]] with [[Billy Childish]], Robert Earl, [[Bill Lewis]], [[Sexton Ming]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]. The Medway Poets used to meet regularly at the Railway Tavern that was known as The York during the period from 1974 to 1985 in Ordnance Street in Chatham.
