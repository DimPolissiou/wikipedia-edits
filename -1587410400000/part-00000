He settled in [[Chicago]] where he joined [[Pullman F.C.]] which had dominated the Chicago Leagues and [[Peel Cup]]. At some point, he moved to the Canadians and finally to [[Bricklayers and Masons F.C.]].

The team went to the 1932 Challenge Cup final, but lost to the [[New Bedford Whalers]]. In 1933 and 1934, McLean would finally achieve success in the Challenge Cup when Stix, Baer and Fuller won two consecutive Challenge Cup titles, to go with two St. Louis Soccer League titles. Following their 1934 Challenge Cup victory, the team came under the sponsorship of Central Breweries. [[St. Louis Central Breweries F.C.]] continued the success they had experienced under the old name by winning a third Challenge Cup and league title in 1935, giving McLean three \"doubles\" in three years. The team went through another name change in 1935, this time to [[St. Louis Shamrocks (1935-1938)|St. Louis Shamrocks]]. In 1936, McLean collapsed during a league game.
