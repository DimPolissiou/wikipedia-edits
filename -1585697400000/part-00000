The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (second from right) and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] (left foreground) meet for talks in Bermuda in March 1957 to repair the rift created by the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].]]\nAt the three-power Bermuda Conference in December 1953, Eisenhower and Churchill,{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} who had become prime minister again on 25 October 1951,{{sfn|Farmelo|2013|pp=372\u2013375}} discussed the possibility of the United States giving Britain access to American nuclear weapons in wartime.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} This came to be called [[Project E]].{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}} There were technical and legal issues that had to be overcome before American bombs could be carried in British aircraft. The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

Durham]] (centre) and AEC Chairman [[Lewis Strauss]] (right) look on.]]\nThe successful development of British thermonuclear weapons came at an opportune time to renew negotiations with the United States. The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK. He ordered extra copies of the report into the fire to be destroyed, and for the printers to destroy their [[Letterpress printing|type]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Britain Suppressed Details of '57 Atomic Disaster: Macmillan feared the loss of U.S. cooperation |first=Steve |last=Lohr |date=2 January 1988 |p=3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/02/world/britain-suppressed-details-of-57-atomic-disaster.html |access-date=18 August 2019 }}</ref> He immediately sensed how shaken the Americans had been by Sputnik.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of IRBMs by a shocked and distraught nation.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nEisenhower and Macmillan agreed to form a study group headed by Sir Richard Powell, the Permanent Secretary to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and [[Donald A. Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

Standing are (left to right): [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] ([[Governor General of Canada]]), [[Mackenzie King]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]]), Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]], and [[Brendan Bracken]].]]\nDuring the early part of the [[Second World War]], Britain had a [[nuclear weapons]] project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}} At the [[Quadrant Conference]] in August 1943, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], signed the [[Quebec Agreement]], which merged Tube Alloys with the American [[Manhattan Project]] to create a combined British, American and Canadian project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=277}} The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] and the [[Combined Development Trust]] to co-ordinate their efforts.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013286}} Many of Britain's top scientists [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|participated in the Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=236\u2013242}}\n\nThe September 1944 [[Hyde Park Aide-M\u00e9moire]] extended both commercial and military co-operation into the post-war period,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=340\u2013342}} but Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and it was not binding on subsequent administrations.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=72\u201373}} In fact, it was physically lost. When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

The album was officially announced on 22 October 2013 by the band's frontman, [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer]] (a.k.a. \"Tom Warrior\"), on his official blog.<ref>[http://fischerisdead.blogspot.com.br/2013/10/triptykon-press-release.html Triptykon Press Release, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe title is in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''\u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03a7\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1'') and, according to Fischer, it can be roughly translated as \"black, deep depressions/valleys\" \u2014 or, more literally, \"chasms as [black as] ink\".\n\nThe album's artwork was provided by famous [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] painter [[H.

It is the third time in his career he has collaborated with Thomas Fischer; Giger also provided artwork for Fischer's former band [[Celtic Frost]]'s first full-length, ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'', in 1985, and to Triptykon's debut ''[[Eparistera Daimones]]'' in 2010. It was Giger's last album cover before his death, just one month after the album's release.\n\nA [[music video]] for the track \"Aurorae\" was released on 7 August 2014. Another video, to \"Tree of Suffocating Souls\", was released on 17 November 2014.

The album was officially announced on 22 October 2013 by the band's frontman, [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer]] (a.k.a. \"Tom Warrior\"), on his official blog.<ref>[http://fischerisdead.blogspot.com.br/2013/10/triptykon-press-release.html Triptykon Press Release, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe title is in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''\u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03a7\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1'') and, according to Fischer, it can be roughly translated as \"black, deep depressions/valleys\" \u2014 or, more literally, \"chasms as [black as] ink\".\n\nThe album's artwork was provided by famous [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] painter [[H.

It was Giger's last album cover before his death, just one month after the album's release.\n\nA [[music video]] for the track \"Aurorae\" was released on 7 August 2014. Another video, to \"Tree of Suffocating Souls\", was released on 17 November 2014.

A drainage basin is the source for water and [[sediment]] that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.\n\n=== Ecology ===\n[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Mississippi River]] drains the largest area of any [[United States|U.S.]] river, much of it [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions. Agricultural runoff and other water pollution that flows to the outlet is the cause of the [[dead zone (ecology)|hypoxic, or dead zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]\n\nDrainage basins are important in [[ecology]]. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and [[water pollution|pollutants]]. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.\n\nModern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause [[eutrophication]] where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.\n\n=== Resource management ===\n{{further|Watershed management}}\nBecause drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], governmental entities that perform this function are called \"[[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed district]]s\". In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called [[Conservation authority (Canada)|conservation authorities]]. In North America, this function is referred to as \"[[watershed management]]\".\nIn [[Brazil]], the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n\u00b0 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.\n\nWhen a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a [[transboundary river]]. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. [[Nile Basin Initiative]], [[OMVS]] for [[Senegal River]], [[Mekong River Commission]] are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.\n\nManagement of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.WA9Ia-V97GI|title=Articles|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}</ref>\n\n== Catchment factors ==\nThe catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of [[flooding]].\n\nCatchment factors are: [[topography]], shape, size, [[soil]] type, and [[land use]] (paved or [[roof]]ed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for [[rain]] to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.\n\n=== Topography ===\nGenerally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep [[mountain]]ous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., > 1% gradient).\n\n=== Shape ===\nShape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.\n\n=== Size ===\nSize will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.\n\n=== Soil type ===\nSoil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. Certain soil types such as [[sand]]y soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing [[clay]] can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become [[wikt:saturated|saturated]], meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.\n\n=== Land use ===\nLand use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, [[sidewalk|pavements]], and [[road]]s will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the [[groundwater]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Wetlands}}\n* {{annotated link|Continental Divide of the Americas}}\n* {{annotated link|Integrated catchment management}}\n* {{annotated link|Interbasin transfer}}\n* {{annotated link|International Journal of River Basin Management|abbreviation=JRBM}}\n* {{annotated link|International Network of Basin Organizations}}\n* {{annotated link|Main stem}}\n* {{annotated link|River basin management plans}}\n* {{annotated link|River bifurcation}}\n* {{annotated link|Tenaja}}\n* {{annotated link|Time of concentration}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* DeBarry, Paul A.

A drainage basin is the source for water and [[sediment]] that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.\n\n=== Ecology ===\n[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Mississippi River]] drains the largest area of any [[United States|U.S.]] river, much of it [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions. Agricultural runoff and other water pollution that flows to the outlet is the cause of the [[dead zone (ecology)|hypoxic, or dead zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]\n\nDrainage basins are important in [[ecology]]. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and [[water pollution|pollutants]]. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.\n\nModern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause [[eutrophication]] where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.\n\n=== Resource management ===\n{{further|Watershed management}}\nBecause drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], governmental entities that perform this function are called \"[[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed district]]s\". In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called [[Conservation authority (Canada)|conservation authorities]]. In North America, this function is referred to as \"[[watershed management]]\".\nIn [[Brazil]], the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n\u00b0 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.\n\nWhen a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a [[transboundary river]]. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. [[Nile Basin Initiative]], [[OMVS]] for [[Senegal River]], [[Mekong River Commission]] are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.\n\nManagement of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.WA9Ia-V97GI|title=Articles|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}</ref>\n\n== Catchment factors ==\nThe catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of [[flooding]].\n\nCatchment factors are: [[topography]], shape, size, [[soil]] type, and [[land use]] (paved or [[roof]]ed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for [[rain]] to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.\n\n=== Topography ===\nGenerally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep [[mountain]]ous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., > 1% gradient).\n\n=== Shape ===\nShape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.\n\n=== Size ===\nSize will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.\n\n=== Soil type ===\nSoil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. Certain soil types such as [[sand]]y soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing [[clay]] can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become [[wikt:saturated|saturated]], meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.\n\n=== Land use ===\nLand use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, [[sidewalk|pavements]], and [[road]]s will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the [[groundwater]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Wetlands}}\n* {{annotated link|Continental Divide of the Americas}}\n* {{annotated link|Integrated catchment management}}\n* {{annotated link|Interbasin transfer}}\n* {{annotated link|International Journal of River Basin Management|abbreviation=JRBM}}\n* {{annotated link|International Network of Basin Organizations}}\n* {{annotated link|Main stem}}\n* {{annotated link|River basin management plans}}\n* {{annotated link|River bifurcation}}\n* {{annotated link|Tenaja}}\n* {{annotated link|Time of concentration}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* DeBarry, Paul A.

{"title_page": "List of scooter manufacturers", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nNote there is no single fixed definition of a '''[[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]''' (also known by the full name '''motor-scooter'''), but generally a smaller motorcycle with a [[step-through frame]] is considered a scooter, especially if it has a floor for the rider's feet (as opposed to straddling the vehicle like a conventional motorcycle). Other common traits of scooters can include: bodywork (so the mechanicals are not exposed like a conventional motorcycle), motors combined with the suspension or wheel (rather than attached to the frame like a conventional motorcycle), leg shields, smaller wheels than a conventional motorcycle, and an alternative to a chain drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scooterfocus.com/what_is_a_scooter.html|title=What is a Scooter, Moped or Motorcycle?|website=www.scooterfocus.com}}</ref> \n\nScooters share traits with [[moped]]s, and some models could even be considered both a moped and a scooter. Adding to the confusion in many areas most scooters are road registered in the same category originally designed for mopeds (and usually still called \"moped\" class), leading to scooters being referred to as \"mopeds\" in such areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carolenash.com/insidebikes/news/scooter-moped-motorcycle/|title=What is a Scooter, Moped or Motorcycle?|date=August 20, 2015|website=Carole Nash}}</ref> [[Underbone |Underbones]] also share traits with scooters, but are generally not considered scooters as they do not have a floor. \n\n==Scooter brands in production==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Einstein regarded his separation principle, descended from Schopenhauer's ''principium individuationis'', as virtually an axiom for any future fundamental physics. ... Schopenhauer stressed the essential structuring role of space and time in individuating physical systems and their evolving states.

Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.

Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there\u2014though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student.

At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.

He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref> But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref> His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 483</ref> Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 484</ref> First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.<ref name=\"auto5\">Cartwright (2010). p. 506</ref> Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenst\u00e4dt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 507\u2013508</ref> They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 508</ref> He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nIn 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered. He became worried for his own safety and property.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cartwright (2010). p. 514</ref> Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 465</ref> He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] for restoring order.<ref name=\"auto7\">Cartwright (2010). p. 515</ref>  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 517</ref> As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans\u2014and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]]\nIn 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy. It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 524</ref> The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.<ref name=\"auto8\">Cartwright (2010). p. 539</ref>  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,<ref name=\"auto9\">Cartwright (2010). pp. 381\u2013386</ref> or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.<ref name=\"auto9\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 537</ref> Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 525</ref> His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 394</ref> and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 510</ref>\n\nAcademic philosophers were also starting to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]\u2019s very critical essay.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 536</ref> Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]] made a first of his four portraits of him\u2014which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like\u2014that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 540</ref> As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining.

Allen & Unwin.</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== The world as representation ===\nSchopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own. As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer.

Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1.

His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\". Plato, \"[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\", Book IX, 863.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].\n\n==== Views on women ====\nIn Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called \"Teutonico-Christian stupidity\" of reflexive unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=\u00dcber die Weiber, \u00a7369}}</ref> for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga. L.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour.

He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas|Mah\u0101v\u0101kya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}.

Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.</ref> Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[ta\u1e47h\u0101]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.''

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u2013321).

In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin \u2013 2001 \u2013 University of Hawaii Press.</ref> While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:\n\n<blockquote>\nPhilosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.<ref>''Parerga & Paralipomena'', vol.

Payne.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3</ref> Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism.

He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.<ref name=\"Myth of Disenchantment\">{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187\u2013188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual.

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.\"<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception.

He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists.

He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity, which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 56</ref> He was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results. Heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.<ref name=\"autogenerated43\">Cartwright (2010). p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 1805, Heinrich died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg. Although it was possible that his death was accidental, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.<ref>Safranski (1990), p. 12. \"There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.\"</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 88</ref>  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 4</ref> His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.<ref name=\"autogenerated9\"/>  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.<ref name=\"autogenerated43\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 90</ref>  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children. Arthur Schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority. He invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 136</ref>\n\n[[File:ArthurSchopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|Schopenhauer as a youth]]\nArthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father, and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 120</ref> Most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 117</ref> His mother moved, with her daughter Adele, to [[Weimar]]\u2014then the centre of [[German literature]]\u2014to enjoy social life among writers and artists. Arthur and his mother were not on good terms.

Some of negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother.<ref>Durant, Will, The Story of Philosophy, Garden City Publishing Co., Inc., New York, p. 350</ref>\nArthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anthime who was also studying to become a merchant.\n\nAfter quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with some encouragement from his mother, he dedicated himself to studies at the [[Gotha]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Gymnasium Ernestinum Gotha|de|3=Ernestinum Gotha|lt=Gymnasium illustre zu Gotha}}) in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 128</ref>  He left Gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the lecturers.  Although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.<ref name=\"autogenerated129\">Cartwright (2010). p. 129</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nHe moved to Weimar but didn't live with his mother, who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well.<ref name=\"autogenerated131\">Cartwright (2010). p. 131</ref> Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences. He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 116</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated131\"/> His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative\u2014and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people.<ref name=\"autogenerated129\"/> Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater. By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]]. Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there\u2014though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student. It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 134</ref> Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 135</ref> Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 21</ref> In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 25</ref> In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits\u2014but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 22</ref>\n\nHe left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen|University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1809. There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but G\u00f6ttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 140</ref> Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]]. Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 141\u2013144</ref> He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 144</ref> He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810\u201311 and he left G\u00f6ttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 150</ref>). He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\">Cartwright (2010). p. 170</ref> During his days at G\u00f6ttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 151</ref>\n\nHe arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811\u201312.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success. Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.<ref name=\"autogenerated159\">Cartwright (2010). p. 159</ref> He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms<ref name=\"autogenerated159\"/>\u2014seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 165\u2013169</ref> He also attended the lectures of the famous Protestant theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], whom he also quickly came to dislike.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 174</ref> His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very [[Criticism of religion|critical of religion]] and moving towards [[atheism]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 175</ref> He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\"/> He attended philological courses by [[August B\u00f6ckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 171\u2013174</ref>\n\n=== Early work ===\nSchopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 179</ref> He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig M\u00fcller von Gerstenbergk (1778\u20131838), a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 188</ref> He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref> But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref> His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]]. Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's. Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements\u2014and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence\u2014soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 247\u2013265</ref> Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 256</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Cartwright (2010). p. 265</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 252</ref>\n\nAnother important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer \u2013 a [[historian of religion]], [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] \u2013 who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}}<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 266</ref> Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}} and put them at par with Plato and Kant.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 268</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Cartwright (2010). p. 272</ref> He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 267</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> Schopenhauer held profound respect for [[Indian philosophy]];{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-69}} although he loved [[Hindu texts]] he was more interested in [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=76-77}} which he came to regard as the best religion.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> However, his studies on Hindu and Buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature,{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=69}} and the latter were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]].

He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 437\u2013452</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 454</ref> He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 454\u2013457</ref> By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn't bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 458</ref> Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 460</ref> His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 463</ref>\n\nIn July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 464</ref> He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz. In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 483</ref> Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 484</ref> First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy.

As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer.

They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of perception ===\nIn November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}</ref> He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality. Hereby Hume's skepticism is disproven.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, \u00a7 4.|location=|pages=|quote=The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,\u2014that is, its a priori character\u2014can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}</ref>\n\nBy this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\".

Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun \"it\" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.<ref>\"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot<ref>\"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.<ref>\"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother.

Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref>\n\nHe was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt.

Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, \"whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.\"</ref><ref>\"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason.

Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.\" ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.</ref>\n\n==== Views on pederasty ====\nIn the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}</ref>\n\n===Intellectual interests and affinities===\n\n====[[Indology]]====\n[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]\n\nSchopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (\"The Great Secret\"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas|Mah\u0101v\u0101kya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}.

Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''.

And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added].

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ...

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception.

The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.\n\nIn his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer.

He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 21.</ref> Rather, they were merely sophists who, excelling in the art of beguiling the public, pursued their own interests and professional advancement. \n\n{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

A [[North American University]] survey shows that the evolution of the disease in the country is slower than that observed elsewhere. Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59 thousand cases and 5.4 thousand deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths. Both, who had their health systems collapsed because of the disease, started the fight by restricting the tests to only the most serious cases \u2013 the same Brazilian strategy.

The work, usually done in 15 days by scientists, was done in just two days, according to the [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] State Research Support Foundation ([[Fapesp]]). The first preliminary analysis by the scientists shows that the genome of the coronavirus diagnosed in Brazil differs in three points in the genetic code of the virus found initially in [[Wuhan]], the Chinese city where the disease arose. According to one of the study's authors, Ester Cerdeira Sabino, the more we unravel the virus's [[RNA]], the more we can track its path.\n\n[[Genetic analysis]] of a virus's [[RNA]] is also essential for the development of [[vaccines]] and the creation of [[diagnostic]] tests. A preliminary analysis of the sequence is now available online for consultation by other researchers worldwide.

A [[North American University]] survey shows that the evolution of the disease in the country is slower than that observed elsewhere. Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59 thousand cases and 5.4 thousand deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths. Both, who had their health systems collapsed because of the disease, started the fight by restricting the tests to only the most serious cases \u2013 the same Brazilian strategy.

game|Single-player]], [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] (on some systems)\n}}\n\n'''''Lemmings''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] video game originally developed by [[DMA Design]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland and published by [[SCE Studio Liverpool|Psygnosis]] for the [[Amiga]] in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by [[Russell Kay (game designer)|Russell Kay]], [[Mike Dailly (game designer)|Mike Dailly]] and [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with [[Deluxe Paint]].\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] [[lemming]]s through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\n''Lemmings'' was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest-rated game in the history of ''[[Amstrad Action]]'', and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' in 1996. ''Lemmings'' is also one of the most widely [[Porting|ported]] and [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games]], and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several [[sequel]]s, [[Video game remake|remake]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, and has also inspired similar games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Amiga Lemmings.png|thumb|left|Lemmings cross a bridge and tunnel through a rock formation in the Amiga version|alt=Lemmings building a bridge over a chasm and excavating a tunnel through a rock formation.]]\n\n''Lemmings'' is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories.<ref name=spectrum/> Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.<ref name=fox/> Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.<ref name=ysr/>\n\nThe goal is to guide at least a certain percentage of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use.<ref name=\"manual\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130221101311/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archivedate=21 February 2013 |title=Lemmings |work=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Unless assigned a special task, each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if they hit an obstacle they cannot pass.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130130162231/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1& |archivedate=30 January 2013 |title=Addictive as Chips, but Less Fattening |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |first=Charles |last=Herold |url-status=dead }}</ref> A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from a great height, falling into water or lava, disappearing off the top, bottom or side of the level map, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill. Every level has a time limit; if the clock counts down to zero, the level automatically ends.\n\nTo successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> There are eight skills that can be assigned:<ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Atari | title=Lemmings Instruction Manual (Atari Lynx) (C398105-080 Rev. A) | pages=5\u20137 | publisher=Atari }}</ref> Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights. Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. Builders build a stairway of 12 steps. Bashers, Miners and Diggers dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.<ref name=spectrum/>\n\nWhile the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to \"nuke\" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers.<ref name=spectrum/> This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nThe four difficulty groups \u2013 \"Fun\", \"Tricky\", \"Taxing\" and \"Mayhem\" \u2013 are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty.<ref name=gs/> This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.\n\n===Two-player mode===\n[[Image:SNES Lemmings2Player.png|thumb|In two-player mode, each player can only control lemmings of their own colour but attempt to guide any lemming to their own goal.]]\n\nThe original ''Lemmings'' also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a [[joystick]] simultaneously.<ref name=\"history\"/> Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\nMike Dailly, the first employee<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> of [[DMA Design]] and one of the programmers for ''Lemmings'', provided a detailed history of the development of the game entitled \"The Lemmings Story\" in 2006.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm |first=Mike |last=Dailly |title=The Complete History of Lemmings |year=2006 |work=The Complete History of Lemmings |accessdate= 10 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627001229/http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm|archivedate=27 June 2015}}</ref> [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], founder of DMA Design, has also commented on the development and success of ''Lemmings''.<ref name=\"jones recount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120526225205/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archivedate=26 May 2012 |title=Playing Catch Up: GTA/Lemmings' Dave Jones |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Alistair |last=Wallis |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lemming animation.gif|left|thumb|The original ''Lemmings'' walk-cycle sprite animations from Mike Dailly (left) and Gary Timmons' improved version on the right. The animation was done using an 8\u00d710 pixel space, with Timmons' version showing a less stiff walk cycle. The animation has eight frames and takes 0.8 seconds to complete one cycle.]]\n\nThe inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in an 8\u00d78 pixel box created by Dailly using [[Deluxe Paint]]<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> as part of development for ''[[Walker (video game)|Walker]]'', then envisioned as a sequel to ''[[Blood Money (video game)|Blood Money]]''.<ref name=\"history\"/> Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly, with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation. One member, Russell Kay, observed that \"There's a game in that!\", and later coined the term \"lemmings\" for these creations, according to Dailly. Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a ''[[Salamander (video game)|Salamander]]'' weapon concept for ''Blood Money'' and demonstrated with the animations.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nLevels were designed based on a [[Deluxe Paint]] interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in \"hundreds of levels\".<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones \"used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.\" They also sent internally tested levels to [[Psygnosis]], getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that \"Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\"<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nEach of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels: Dailly's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as \"It's Hero Time\", suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons's levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles, and Scott Johnston's (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the \"custom\" levels based on other Psygnosis and [[Reflections Interactive]] Amiga games, including ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'', ''[[Menace (video game)|Menace]]'', ''[[Awesome (video game)|Awesome]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Beast II]]''. These \"crossover\" levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, \"This I believe is where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve.\" Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Music}}Music was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis asked [[Tim Wright (Welsh musician)|Tim Wright]] to replace the offending tracks, who often used arrangements and reworkings of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Traditional music|traditional]] music to avoid copyright problems.<ref name=\"history\" /> Music tracks in the game include: \"Galop Infernal\" from ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' (the music by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] often used for the [[can-can]]), \"Rondo alla Turca\" from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata No. 11]], \"Dance of the Reed Flutes\" from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Nutcracker Suite]], \"[[Danse des petits cygnes|Dance of the Little Swans]]\" from Tchaikovsky's [[Swan Lake]], \"Ten Lemmings\" (a track that uses melodies from traditional song \"[[Ten Green Bottles]]\", [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] (the part used as funeral march), [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s \"[[Bridal Chorus]]\" (popularly known as \"Here Comes the Bride\"), \"[[London Bridge is Falling Down]]\", the English folk tune \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem|Forest Green]]\" (adapted into the hymn \"All Beautiful the March of Days\"), the carol \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" mixed with the melody from the film ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', \"[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]\", and \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\".<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nThe two-player option was inspired by then-current games ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'' and ''[[Stunt Car Racer]]''. DMA Design initially wanted to use a [[null modem|null-modem]] connection between two machines to allow competitive play, but ended up using the ability of the Amiga to have two mouse pointer devices usable at the same time and thus created the split-screen mode.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n==Ports and remakes==\nThe popularity of the game on the Amiga led to its rapid [[porting]] to many other platforms, and it is regarded as one of the most widely ported video games.<ref name=\"jones recount\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerelectronicsnet.com/games/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=46303 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141210075052/http://www.consumerelectronicsnet.com/games/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=46303 |archivedate=10 December 2014 |title=Lemmings PSP Review |work=Consumer Electronics Net |first=Don |last=Lee |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Within a year of its release, the game had been ported to [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair Spectrum]], [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]].<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> David Jones stated that after porting the game to 20 systems, he stopped keeping count of additional ports.<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> Other commercial ports of the original game include [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[Apple IIgs]], [[Apple Macintosh]], [[CDTV]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[Philips CD-i]] and [[Sharp X68000]].<ref name=fox>{{cite book|last=Fox |first=Matt |date=3 January 2013 |title=The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed. |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xzMYYrsDaAEC&pg=PA169 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |page=169 |isbn=978-0786472574 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402230011/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xzMYYrsDaAEC&pg=PA169 |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe license to the ''Lemmings'' intellectual property had remained with Psygnosis, which became part of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in 1993 but ultimately folded in 2012, leaving ''Lemmings'' as a Sony property.

[[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] (on some systems)\n}}\n\n'''''Lemmings''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] video game originally developed by [[DMA Design]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland and published by [[SCE Studio Liverpool|Psygnosis]] for the [[Amiga]] in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by [[Russell Kay (game designer)|Russell Kay]], [[Mike Dailly (game designer)|Mike Dailly]] and [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with [[Deluxe Paint]].\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] [[lemming]]s through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\n''Lemmings'' was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest-rated game in the history of ''[[Amstrad Action]]'', and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' in 1996. ''Lemmings'' is also one of the most widely [[Porting|ported]] and [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games]], and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several [[sequel]]s, [[Video game remake|remake]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, and has also inspired similar games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Amiga Lemmings.png|thumb|left|Lemmings cross a bridge and tunnel through a rock formation in the Amiga version|alt=Lemmings building a bridge over a chasm and excavating a tunnel through a rock formation.]]\n\n''Lemmings'' is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories.<ref name=spectrum/> Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.<ref name=fox/> Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.<ref name=ysr/>\n\nThe goal is to guide at least a certain percentage of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use.<ref name=\"manual\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130221101311/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archivedate=21 February 2013 |title=Lemmings |work=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Unless assigned a special task, each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if they hit an obstacle they cannot pass.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130130162231/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1& |archivedate=30 January 2013 |title=Addictive as Chips, but Less Fattening |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |first=Charles |last=Herold |url-status=dead }}</ref> A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from a great height, falling into water or lava, disappearing off the top, bottom or side of the level map, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill. Every level has a time limit; if the clock counts down to zero, the level automatically ends.\n\nTo successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> There are eight skills that can be assigned:<ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Atari | title=Lemmings Instruction Manual (Atari Lynx) (C398105-080 Rev. A) | pages=5\u20137 | publisher=Atari }}</ref> Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights. Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. Builders build a stairway of 12 steps. Bashers, Miners and Diggers dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.<ref name=spectrum/>\n\nWhile the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to \"nuke\" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers.<ref name=spectrum/> This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nThe four difficulty groups \u2013 \"Fun\", \"Tricky\", \"Taxing\" and \"Mayhem\" \u2013 are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty.<ref name=gs/> This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.\n\n===Two-player mode===\n[[Image:SNES Lemmings2Player.png|thumb|In two-player mode, each player can only control lemmings of their own colour but attempt to guide any lemming to their own goal.]]\n\nThe original ''Lemmings'' also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a [[joystick]] simultaneously.<ref name=\"history\"/> Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\nMike Dailly, the first employee<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> of [[DMA Design]] and one of the programmers for ''Lemmings'', provided a detailed history of the development of the game entitled \"The Lemmings Story\" in 2006.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm |first=Mike |last=Dailly |title=The Complete History of Lemmings |year=2006 |work=The Complete History of Lemmings |accessdate= 10 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627001229/http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm|archivedate=27 June 2015}}</ref> [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], founder of DMA Design, has also commented on the development and success of ''Lemmings''.<ref name=\"jones recount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120526225205/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archivedate=26 May 2012 |title=Playing Catch Up: GTA/Lemmings' Dave Jones |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Alistair |last=Wallis |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lemming animation.gif|left|thumb|The original ''Lemmings'' walk-cycle sprite animations from Mike Dailly (left) and Gary Timmons' improved version on the right. The animation was done using an 8\u00d710 pixel space, with Timmons' version showing a less stiff walk cycle. The animation has eight frames and takes 0.8 seconds to complete one cycle.]]\n\nThe inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in an 8\u00d78 pixel box created by Dailly using [[Deluxe Paint]]<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> as part of development for ''[[Walker (video game)|Walker]]'', then envisioned as a sequel to ''[[Blood Money (video game)|Blood Money]]''.<ref name=\"history\"/> Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly, with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation. One member, Russell Kay, observed that \"There's a game in that!\", and later coined the term \"lemmings\" for these creations, according to Dailly. Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a ''[[Salamander (video game)|Salamander]]'' weapon concept for ''Blood Money'' and demonstrated with the animations.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nLevels were designed based on a [[Deluxe Paint]] interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in \"hundreds of levels\".<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones \"used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.\" They also sent internally tested levels to [[Psygnosis]], getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that \"Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\"<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nEach of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels: Dailly's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as \"It's Hero Time\", suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons's levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles, and Scott Johnston's (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the \"custom\" levels based on other Psygnosis and [[Reflections Interactive]] Amiga games, including ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'', ''[[Menace (video game)|Menace]]'', ''[[Awesome (video game)|Awesome]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Beast II]]''. These \"crossover\" levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, \"This I believe is where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve.\" Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Music}}Music was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis asked [[Tim Wright (Welsh musician)|Tim Wright]] to replace the offending tracks, who often used arrangements and reworkings of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Traditional music|traditional]] music to avoid copyright problems.<ref name=\"history\" /> Music tracks in the game include: \"Galop Infernal\" from ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' (the music by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] often used for the [[can-can]]), \"Rondo alla Turca\" from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata No. 11]], \"Dance of the Reed Flutes\" from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Nutcracker Suite]], \"[[Danse des petits cygnes|Dance of the Little Swans]]\" from Tchaikovsky's [[Swan Lake]], \"Ten Lemmings\" (a track that uses melodies from traditional song \"[[Ten Green Bottles]]\", [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] (the part used as funeral march), [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s \"[[Bridal Chorus]]\" (popularly known as \"Here Comes the Bride\"), \"[[London Bridge is Falling Down]]\", the English folk tune \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem|Forest Green]]\" (adapted into the hymn \"All Beautiful the March of Days\"), the carol \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" mixed with the melody from the film ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', \"[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]\", and \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\".<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nThe two-player option was inspired by then-current games ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'' and ''[[Stunt Car Racer]]''.
