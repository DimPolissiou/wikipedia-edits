An American and French co-production, it is Audiard's first work in the [[English language]]. The film stars [[John C. Reilly]] (who also produced) and [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters, and follows the duo as they chase after two men ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and [[Riz Ahmed]]) who have banded together to search for gold.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival|Venice International Film Festival]] on September 2, 2018, where it won the [[Silver Lion|Silver Lion for Best Direction]], and was theatrically released in the United States on September 21, 2018. ''The Sisters Brothers'' received positive reviews from critics, with most praise going to its performances, characters, direction and soundtrack. It was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $13.1 million against its $38 million production budget. It was the final feature film featuring [[Rutger Hauer]] released before his death, although he had finished filming several projects released after his passing.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the American West in 1851, brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters are gunfighters hired by a wealthy businessman, known as the Commodore. He tasks them to kill a man named Hermann Warm.\n\nJohn Morris, a private detective, has been engaged by the Commodore to track Warm down and hand him over to the Sisters brothers. Morris finds Warm traveling by wagon train to California with the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and befriends him. They travel to [[Jacksonville, Oregon|Jacksonville]] where, unbeknown to Warm, Morris has arranged his rendezvous with the Sisters brothers. Warm finds Morris\u2019 handcuffs, realizes his true intentions, and threatens him at gunpoint, but Morris overpowers him. Warm reveals that he is en route to find gold using a chemical formula of his own invention; the Sisters brothers have been sent to retrieve the formula, most likely by torturing Warm before killing him. Refusing to allow an innocent man\u2019s murder, Morris frees Warm and the two leave Jacksonville. On the road toward [[San Francisco]], Warm reveals that his ultimate plan is to create a utopian society, free from greed and other social ills in Dallas, Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, the brothers' pursuit is plagued by misfortune. A grizzly bear attacks their camp and mauls a horse, Eli almost dies from a venomous spider bite, and Charlie is repeatedly drunk and too hung over to ride. When they discover Morris' betrayal in Jacksonville, they follow the pair to Mayfield. At Ms. Mayfield's hotel and brothel, she denies having seen Warm and Morris, but offers the brothers a warm welcome. A sympathetic prostitute warns Eli of an impending attack, and he attempts to leave with a drunken Charlie, but they are cornered by gunslingers hired by Mayfield. The brothers kill the gunslingers and interrogate Mayfield as to Warm's and Morris\u2019 whereabouts, before murdering and robbing her.\n\nIn San Francisco, Charlie and Eli argue about continuing their hunt. Eli wishes to retire but Charlie angrily rejects this idea. The next day, Charlie reveals that he has found [[land claim#staking a claim|a claim staked]] in Morris\u2019 name a few days' ride away. Eli agrees to complete the hunt as their final job.\n\nOn the way to the claim site, the brothers are ambushed and captured by Warm and Morris, who are then attacked by Mayfield's men sent before her death to claim the formula for herself. The four men team up to kill Mayfield's men, after which Charlie and Eli agree to help Warm and Morris find gold in exchange for half the takings. Warm and Morris decide to prospect together and create a [[phalanst\u00e8re]] in [[Dallas]]. Working to dam the river, the new partners develop a camaraderie. Eli reveals to Warm that Charlie killed their abusive, alcoholic father when they were young, and that Charlie's short temper and violent tendencies put him in danger, so Eli reluctantly took up their present employment to protect him.\n\nThe dam is completed, and Warm explains that when his chemical formula is added to water, it causes gold ore to glow briefly, but is extremely caustic. The men pour the formula into the river and begin gathering the gold. When the glow begins to fade, Charlie panics and tries to add more formula, but spills the undiluted substance onto his hand and into the river. Eli rushes out of the river to restrain Charlie, while the undiluted formula badly injures Warm and Morris. The next day, Warm succumbs to his injuries while Morris shoots himself to end his suffering.\n\nEli takes Charlie to the nearest town, where a doctor amputates his arm. Hired guns sent by the Commodore arrive and demand their surrender. Eli shoots them, and he and Charlie decide they must kill the Commodore. They arrive in Oregon City to find that the Commodore has died. During the brothers' visit to the Commodore's open casket, Eli punches the Commodore's corpse to verify the Commodore has indeed died. The brothers return home to their mother; though initially suspicious, she welcomes them in.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John C.

An American and French co-production, it is Audiard's first work in the [[English language]]. The film stars [[John C. Reilly]] (who also produced) and [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters, and follows the duo as they chase after two men ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and [[Riz Ahmed]]) who have banded together to search for gold.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival|Venice International Film Festival]] on September 2, 2018, where it won the [[Silver Lion|Silver Lion for Best Direction]], and was theatrically released in the United States on September 21, 2018. ''The Sisters Brothers'' received positive reviews from critics, with most praise going to its performances, characters, direction and soundtrack. It was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $13.1 million against its $38 million production budget. It was the final feature film featuring [[Rutger Hauer]] released before his death, although he had finished filming several projects released after his passing.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the American West in 1851, brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters are gunfighters hired by a wealthy businessman, known as the Commodore. He tasks them to kill a man named Hermann Warm.\n\nJohn Morris, a private detective, has been engaged by the Commodore to track Warm down and hand him over to the Sisters brothers. Morris finds Warm traveling by wagon train to California with the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and befriends him. They travel to [[Jacksonville, Oregon|Jacksonville]] where, unbeknown to Warm, Morris has arranged his rendezvous with the Sisters brothers. Warm finds Morris\u2019 handcuffs, realizes his true intentions, and threatens him at gunpoint, but Morris overpowers him. Warm reveals that he is en route to find gold using a chemical formula of his own invention; the Sisters brothers have been sent to retrieve the formula, most likely by torturing Warm before killing him. Refusing to allow an innocent man\u2019s murder, Morris frees Warm and the two leave Jacksonville. On the road toward [[San Francisco]], Warm reveals that his ultimate plan is to create a utopian society, free from greed and other social ills in Dallas, Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, the brothers' pursuit is plagued by misfortune. A grizzly bear attacks their camp and mauls a horse, Eli almost dies from a venomous spider bite, and Charlie is repeatedly drunk and too hung over to ride. When they discover Morris' betrayal in Jacksonville, they follow the pair to Mayfield. At Ms. Mayfield's hotel and brothel, she denies having seen Warm and Morris, but offers the brothers a warm welcome. A sympathetic prostitute warns Eli of an impending attack, and he attempts to leave with a drunken Charlie, but they are cornered by gunslingers hired by Mayfield. The brothers kill the gunslingers and interrogate Mayfield as to Warm's and Morris\u2019 whereabouts, before murdering and robbing her.\n\nIn San Francisco, Charlie and Eli argue about continuing their hunt. Eli wishes to retire but Charlie angrily rejects this idea. The next day, Charlie reveals that he has found [[land claim#staking a claim|a claim staked]] in Morris\u2019 name a few days' ride away. Eli agrees to complete the hunt as their final job.\n\nOn the way to the claim site, the brothers are ambushed and captured by Warm and Morris, who are then attacked by Mayfield's men sent before her death to claim the formula for herself. The four men team up to kill Mayfield's men, after which Charlie and Eli agree to help Warm and Morris find gold in exchange for half the takings. Warm and Morris decide to prospect together and create a [[phalanst\u00e8re]] in [[Dallas]]. Working to dam the river, the new partners develop a camaraderie. Eli reveals to Warm that Charlie killed their abusive, alcoholic father when they were young, and that Charlie's short temper and violent tendencies put him in danger, so Eli reluctantly took up their present employment to protect him.\n\nThe dam is completed, and Warm explains that when his chemical formula is added to water, it causes gold ore to glow briefly, but is extremely caustic. The men pour the formula into the river and begin gathering the gold. When the glow begins to fade, Charlie panics and tries to add more formula, but spills the undiluted substance onto his hand and into the river. Eli rushes out of the river to restrain Charlie, while the undiluted formula badly injures Warm and Morris. The next day, Warm succumbs to his injuries while Morris shoots himself to end his suffering.\n\nEli takes Charlie to the nearest town, where a doctor amputates his arm. Hired guns sent by the Commodore arrive and demand their surrender. Eli shoots them, and he and Charlie decide they must kill the Commodore. They arrive in Oregon City to find that the Commodore has died. During the brothers' visit to the Commodore's open casket, Eli punches the Commodore's corpse to verify the Commodore has indeed died.

The young teacher lets an older girl read the names of her attendance list, while she distributes paper booklets. The children are seen writing busily into them, but Manuel draws pictures. The teacher calls him out reminding him that it is mathematics lesson and everyone giggles. \nAs the children walk home through swampy grass they pass by [[Colombian paramilitaries|paramilitaries]] training in the field above them. Manuel's older friend Julian says that his older brother left town supposedly to work on the coast, though he believes he is with unnamed \"guerillas\". Manuel is seen cheer leading to play and starts a ball game in a tight circle of 10 boys, complaining the ball is a rag.\n\nManuel lives with his mother, father Ernesto and infant brother on a small [[finca]], owning a couple of cows and raising pigs. \nHe takes a trip to a market where his father tries to sell a piglet.

The young teacher lets an older girl read the names of her attendance list, while she distributes paper booklets. The children are seen writing busily into them, but Manuel draws pictures. The teacher calls him out reminding him that it is mathematics lesson and everyone giggles. \nAs the children walk home through swampy grass they pass by [[Colombian paramilitaries|paramilitaries]] training in the field above them. Manuel's older friend Julian says that his older brother left town supposedly to work on the coast, though he believes he is with unnamed \"guerillas\". Manuel is seen cheer leading to play and starts a ball game in a tight circle of 10 boys, complaining the ball is a rag.\n\nManuel lives with his mother, father Ernesto and infant brother on a small [[finca]], owning a couple of cows and raising pigs. \nHe takes a trip to a market where his father tries to sell a piglet. His father leaves Manuel at an outdoor cafe table, disappears in a house and returns with a small grain sack. Back home at night he is seated at a small table opposite his father with his infant son on his lap. Manuel's mother brings in a small chocolate cake lit with nine candles and Manuel unpacks his birthday present, a soccer ball and goalkeeper gloves.\n\nThe next day the boys are seen playing soccer with the new ball which lands in a rocky flat.

The team was led by [[List of coaches in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] head coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]]. The team was noted for being one of the most disappointing USA men's Olympic teams, after it lost three games in the Olympics against its opponents, which is the most games ever lost by a USA men's Olympic basketball team. \n\nOne of the losses was the biggest loss by points margin in a game in their history, which came in a loss against [[Puerto Rico national basketball team|Puerto Rico]]. The team also lost games in the Olympics to [[Lithuania men's national basketball team|Lithuania]] and [[Argentine national basketball team|Argentina]].

Nine of its 12 players elected not to participate in Athens. As a result, the 2004 U.S. team consisted of some young NBA stars that were still early in their careers, such as [[Dwyane Wade]], [[LeBron James]] and [[Carmelo Anthony]]. Only [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Tim Duncan]] and [[Allen Iverson]] were a part of the 2003 [[2003 FIBA Tournament of the Americas|FIBA Tournament of the Americas San Juan]] gold medal team and the 2004 Olympics team. The 2004 Olympics team was guided by head coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]].

The first two seasons adapt the 1989 entry ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'' and follow [[Trevor Belmont]], [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] and [[Sypha Belnades]] as they defend the nation of [[Wallachia]] from [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] and his minions. Seasons 2 and 3 borrow characters and elements from the 2005 entry ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]]''.\n\nThe series was originally planned as a film, developed by producer Kevin Kolde and his company Project 51. Kolde had a contract for a script with writer [[Warren Ellis]] in 2007; the project entered [[development hell]] until about 2015, when [[Adi Shankar]] boarded the project and it was picked up by streaming service [[Netflix]]. [[Powerhouse Animation Studios]] joined the team and production commenced. Its art style is heavily influenced by Japanese [[anime]] and [[Ayami Kojima]]'s artwork in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' with the production team including staff members who worked in the Japanese anime industry.\n\nThe series premiered on Netflix on July 7, 2017, and was renewed for an expanded second season of eight episodes on the same day; the second season premiered on October 26, 2018. A ten-episode third season was greenlit by Netflix and released on March 5, 2020.

Intrigued by her courage and ambition, Dracula agrees to teach her, while she in turn offers to help him reconnect with humanity. The two eventually fall in love and marry. Twenty years later (1475), in the town of [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], Lisa is burned at the stake after a bishop discovers scientific equipment in her home and accuses her of witchcraft. Dracula is devastated and furious upon learning of his wife's death and declares the people have one year to make their peace, after which every human in Wallachia will die by his hand. His son [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Adrian]] tells him to instead go after the man responsible instead of all of humanity, but Dracula refuses to listen and attacks him. One year later, the archbishop hosts a celebration in defiance of Dracula. As promised, Dracula kills the archbishop, destroys the church and orders his demon army to kill every person left in Wallachia. As the army spreads across the land, the people place the blame on the kingdom's noble families, including the Belmonts.\n |LineColor       = 420701\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Necropolis\n |DirectedBy      = Sam Deats\n |WrittenBy       = Warren Ellis\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|7|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Following an altercation at a pub, [[Trevor Belmont]] seeks food and respite in the city of Gresit, which has been besieged by Dracula's forces every night.

He saves their Elder from a pair of corrupt priests, who brings him back to his home to meet his fellow Speakers. Trevor insists they leave the city for their own safety, but the Elder refuses, as his grandchild has gone missing after venturing into the catacombs below the city in search of the \"sleeping soldier\", a legendary hero who they believe can defeat Dracula.

After returning Sypha to her grandfather, Trevor is summoned to the church by the local bishop, the same bishop who ordered Lisa's execution. He orders Trevor to leave Gresit before sundown, as they plan to lead a mob to kill the Speakers, offering to spare Trevor and restore his family name in exchange.

During the battle, the floor crumbles beneath Trevor and Sypha and they fall deep into the submerged catacombs of the city. Making their way in deeper, they find the \"sleeping soldier\", revealed to be Adrian, who has spent a year healing from his last fight with Dracula. Adrian, now going by Alucard, engages Trevor in battle, but after seeing his and Sypha's resolve, Alucard relents and reveals that he was testing their abilities because the myth of the \"sleeping soldier\" was actually from the future and foretold Alucard's meeting with Belmont and Sypha.

In the present, Dracula assembles his war council, made up of vampire overlords from across the world, and places human necromancers Hector and Isaac in charge of the war on humanity. The viking vampire Godbrand objects, believing they should rely on vampires instead of humans for leadership, but Dracula believes Hector and Isaac's hatred of their own kind makes them more trustworthy. As Gresit rebuilds after the battle, Sypha and Trevor see off the other Speakers while Alucard comes to terms with the decision to kill his father. At the castle, Godbrand laments to Hector that their war is being fought with no strategy apart from wanton destruction.

Trevor recommends revisiting his old family estate, as the hold beneath the ruins contains plenty of information and tools for monster-hunting. At Dracula's castle, the vampire mistress Carmilla arrives and causes further discord among the council by criticizing Dracula's approach and inquiring his reasons of having not sired Lisa into a vampire. While traveling to the Belmont estate, Trevor's party is attacked by Dracula's forces; the group slays all the attackers, save one injured demon who escapes. At the castle, Isaac reminisces on his past, having killed his previous abusive master in a moment that shaped his ideals. Godbrand brings Isaac the injured demon, now dead, to extract information from it with his necromancy. At another assembly, the generals argue whether to continue their attack on [[Arge\u0219 County|Arge\u0219]] or move the siege towards [[Br\u0103ila County|Br\u0103ila]] at Carmilla's suggestion.

Trevor, Sypha and Alucard reach the ruins of the Belmont estate and open a magically-sealed door leading to a massive underground library. Sypha begins researching and Trevor locates several monster-hunting weapons, including the Morning Star whip, while Alucard is left uneasy by the various vampire remains preserved there. At Dracula's castle, Godbrand expresses his dissatisfaction with the plan to exterminate the human race, believing they will be left hungry without human blood to consume, and Dracula rebukes him. Carmilla tells Godbrand that Dracula must take the castle to Br\u0103ila, revealing how she killed the vampire who sired her after he became old and mad, deeming Dracula has become the same and unfit to lead them.\n |LineColor       = 770101\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Broken Mast\n |DirectedBy      = Sam Deats\n |WrittenBy       = Warren Ellis\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Godbrand comes to agree with Carmilla that Dracula is not fit to lead and something must be done to change his plans.

In a flashback, Isaac recalls how Dracula saved his life and recruited him to create his army. Godbrand and the other vampire generals grow tired of living without human blood and set out on demonic horses to a nearby village, slaughtering the people. Dracula speaks to Isaac about the war hall turning against him and confesses he lied to Hector about his intent to spare a few humans.

Isaac discusses Hector's request with Dracula, but asserts that there is no betrayal to be concerned about. Dracula reminisces about a time he once savored killing humans but admits he is tired and cares only for results instead of the details. Carmilla and Hector approach Dracula and he approves the attack on Br\u0103ila. Afterwards, Carmilla turns on Hector, explaining he is now implicated in her impending betrayal of Dracula and cannot turn back on her plan now.

At Carmilla's behest, Hector reanimates the Bishop and makes him bless the river. Carmilla's troops reveal themselves and bring down the bridge, dropping many of Dracula's soldiers to be destroyed by the now-holy water. Dracula's remaining forces retreat to the castle whilst Carmilla's soldiers cross the river on makeshift bridges. The two armies begin to battle in the castle's main hall, while Carmilla and Hector move elsewhere. Sypha finishes the spell just as Trevor defeats the last of the demons, her struggle against the castle's mechanisms causing the castle to teleport within Br\u0103ila, landing in the river with most of the vampires of both factions killed by the holy water flooding into the castle.

Alucard reaches the study and attacks Dracula, backed by Trevor and Sypha. The group manages to inflict some damage, but Dracula overpowers them, and engages in hand-to-hand combat with Alucard, moving through the castle as they battle. Eventually the two end up in Alucard's childhood room where Dracula has a break down upon realizing the reality of him trying to kill his own son. Dracula allows Alucard to stake him through the heart, while Trevor arrives to decapitate the decomposing vampire and Sypha burns the remains, leaving only his wedding ring intact.

Frederator brought writer [[Warren Ellis]] aboard as the screenwriter for the series. In an interview with ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', Warren Ellis said that when he was contacted about ''Castlevania'' he had no previous knowledge of the series and discovered it was a \"Japanese transposition of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror films]] I grew up with and loved\".<ref name=\"paste magazine\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/warren-ellis-on-castlevania-the-legacy-of-hammer-h.html |title=Warren Ellis on Castlevania, the Legacy of Hammer Horror, and the Creative Liberation of Writing for Netflix |first=Toussaint |last=Egan |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 8, 2017 |website=Paste Magazine}}</ref> Ellis explained how he worked with ''Castlevania'' producer [[Koji Igarashi]] to fit the film into the timeline of the series, including writing a new backstory, and how he was frustrated that Igarashi wanted eight full re-writes of pre-production material before giving approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/7/15934226/netflix-castlevania|title=Netflix's new Castlevania series is the most bingeable show at just under 100 minutes|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2017-07-07|website=Polygon|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> Ellis noted that Frederator's Kevin Kolde, who was slated to produce the work, did not want the film to be aimed at children, allowing Ellis to use gruesome imagery and scenes as necessary to tell the story he wanted to write, something that Ellis had found restrictive in working with normal television animation.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nIn adapting the game for the film, Ellis did not want to make a point-for-point adaption, but instead provide some material to flesh out the game's world and elements behind it. At this stage, the film was anticipated to be only 80 minutes long, which Ellis knew would not be enough to tell the full story he wanted, so was able to break apart his script into a trilogy of works, each part having a self-contained [[three-act structure]]; the first part would be to introduce the characters of Dracula, Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard and with a meaningful narrative resolution. In this manner, Ellis noted that if the other two parts were never greenlit, the first work \"doesn't demand the presence of the other two parts for it to work as its own thing\".<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |title=The First Time Warren Ellis Wrote A Castlevania Animation, Ten Years Ago |first=Rich |last=Johnson |date=February 9, 2017 |accessdate=July 11, 2017 |website=[[Bleeding Cool News]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311002425/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |archivedate=March 11, 2017 }}</ref> Due to the limited time, Ellis opted to drop [[Grant DaNasty|Grant Danasty]], a pirate character in the game; Ellis noted that besides \"the stupid name\", he felt the pirate was misplaced in the setting and that the limited run time would not allow him to develop the character fully.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nSometime around 2008, work on the production stalled, and entered [[development hell]].<ref name=\"dtoid\">{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/10-years-of-purgatory-wasn-t-enough-to-keep-netflix-s-castlevania-down-447906.phtml | title = 10 years of purgatory wasn't enough to keep Netflix's Castlevania down | first = Peter | last = Glagowski | date = July 10, 2017 | accessdate = July 10, 2017 | website = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Ellis had completed his script in June 2008, and the show's production blog had said in August 2008 that they were shopping around the idea as a theatrical release, but no further updates followed before the blog was quietly deleted.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nAround 2012, [[Adi Shankar]] was approached to direct a live-action version of Ellis' script. Shankar, who at the time had just finished work as executive producer of ''[[Dredd]]'', said that the party was looking to make a film in the style of the ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'' films with a similar budget, representative of a small studio with large independent backing. Shankar turned the opportunity down, saying it felt \"250 percent wrong\", as he had deep respect for the original game and felt the live-action version would not treat it well.<ref name=\"polygon july11\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/11/15952898/castlevania-live-action-adaptation-netflix | title = Castlevania producer turned down live-action adaptation because 'it felt wrong' | first = Julia | last = Alexander | date = July 11, 2017 | accessdate = July 11, 2017 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Following this, Shankar stepped back from Hollywood to pursue more self-published works, stating that \"the major studios were blatantly disrespecting fandom\" as a reason he turned down the offer.<ref name=\"polygon july11\"/>\n\nThe show was revitalized when [[Powerhouse Animation Studios]]'s Sam Deats was able to negotiate a deal with [[Netflix]] for the production, using the existing scripts that had been written nearly a decade prior. Powerhouse reached out to Frederator to help with the show's production.<ref name=\"dtoid\"/> According to Ellis, Netflix was very positive about his original scripts that he wrote in 2007, and so he had to only make a few changes to fit the Netflix format while staying true to the version of the script Konami had accepted.<ref name=\"paste magazine\"/> Shankar was approached with the opportunity

The first two seasons adapt the 1989 entry ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'' and follow [[Trevor Belmont]], [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] and [[Sypha Belnades]] as they defend the nation of [[Wallachia]] from [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] and his minions. Seasons 2 and 3 borrow characters and elements from the 2005 entry ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]]''.\n\nThe series was originally planned as a film, developed by producer Kevin Kolde and his company Project 51. Kolde had a contract for a script with writer [[Warren Ellis]] in 2007; the project entered [[development hell]] until about 2015, when [[Adi Shankar]] boarded the project and it was picked up by streaming service [[Netflix]]. [[Powerhouse Animation Studios]] joined the team and production commenced. Its art style is heavily influenced by Japanese [[anime]] and [[Ayami Kojima]]'s artwork in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' with the production team including staff members who worked in the Japanese anime industry.\n\nThe series premiered on Netflix on July 7, 2017, and was renewed for an expanded second season of eight episodes on the same day; the second season premiered on October 26, 2018. A ten-episode third season was greenlit by Netflix and released on March 5, 2020. On March 27, 2020, Netflix announced they have renewed the series for a fourth season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/03/27/castlevania-season-4-netflix/|title=Netflix Announces Castlevania Season 4|website=Anime|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nWhen his wife is burned at the stake after being falsely accused of witchcraft, the vampire Count [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] declares all the people of [[Wallachia]] will pay with their lives.

At the castle, Isaac reminisces on his past, having killed his previous abusive master in a moment that shaped his ideals. Godbrand brings Isaac the injured demon, now dead, to extract information from it with his necromancy. At another assembly, the generals argue whether to continue their attack on [[Arge\u0219 County|Arge\u0219]] or move the siege towards [[Br\u0103ila County|Br\u0103ila]] at Carmilla's suggestion. Isaac informs everyone of his findings, believing Alucard is working with a Belmont. Carmilla urges Dracula to keep watch on the Belmont estate, believing it may contain something that could destroy them.\n |LineColor       = 770101\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Shadow Battles\n |DirectedBy      = Adam Deats\n |WrittenBy       = Warren Ellis\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Carmilla tries to convince Hector to create creatures to send to the Belmont house while encouraging Dracula to select Br\u0103ila as their next target. Hector reminisces on how Dracula found him in the east of [[Rhodes]] and recruited him to raise an army, though Hector asked for a humane cull of humans rather than a cruel genocide. Trevor, Sypha and Alucard reach the ruins of the Belmont estate and open a magically-sealed door leading to a massive underground library. Sypha begins researching and Trevor locates several monster-hunting weapons, including the Morning Star whip, while Alucard is left uneasy by the various vampire remains preserved there. At Dracula's castle, Godbrand expresses his dissatisfaction with the plan to exterminate the human race, believing they will be left hungry without human blood to consume, and Dracula rebukes him. Carmilla tells Godbrand that Dracula must take the castle to Br\u0103ila, revealing how she killed the vampire who sired her after he became old and mad, deeming Dracula has become the same and unfit to lead them.\n |LineColor       = 770101\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Broken Mast\n |DirectedBy      = Sam Deats\n |WrittenBy       = Warren Ellis\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Godbrand comes to agree with Carmilla that Dracula is not fit to lead and something must be done to change his plans. At the Belmont library, Trevor discovers a magical mirror which allows them to see things far away, and he bonds with Sypha. Carmilla continues to try to recruit Hector, intending to unseat Dracula if the castle is moved to Br\u0103ila. In a flashback, Isaac recalls how Dracula saved his life and recruited him to create his army. Godbrand and the other vampire generals grow tired of living without human blood and set out on demonic horses to a nearby village, slaughtering the people. Dracula speaks to Isaac about the war hall turning against him and confesses he lied to Hector about his intent to spare a few humans. Godbrand privately approaches Isaac and suggests that they should pursue the war without Dracula, Isaac killing Godbrand for his treasonous intentions.\n |LineColor       = 770101\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Last Spell\n |DirectedBy      = Sam Deats\n |WrittenBy       = Warren Ellis\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Isaac releases Godbrand's ashes from the castle rooftop while Carmilla commands her troops to assemble at Br\u0103ila. Hector convinces Isaac to agree to the attack on Br\u0103ila. Hector feeds this back to Carmilla and informs her that his night creatures have nearly reached the Belmont estate. Isaac discusses Hector's request with Dracula, but asserts that there is no betrayal to be concerned about. Dracula reminisces about a time he once savored killing humans but admits he is tired and cares only for results instead of the details. Carmilla and Hector approach Dracula and he approves the attack on Br\u0103ila. Afterwards, Carmilla turns on Hector, explaining he is now implicated in her impending betrayal of Dracula and cannot turn back on her plan now. At the Belmont library, Sypha discovers an unfinished locking spell that could be used to trap the castle in one place.

Dracula moves the castle to Br\u0103ila, and most of the vampire generals lead troops across the bridge to attack the town. At Carmilla's behest, Hector reanimates the Bishop and makes him bless the river. Carmilla's troops reveal themselves and bring down the bridge, dropping many of Dracula's soldiers to be destroyed by the now-holy water. Dracula's remaining forces retreat to the castle whilst Carmilla's soldiers cross the river on makeshift bridges. The two armies begin to battle in the castle's main hall, while Carmilla and Hector move elsewhere. Sypha finishes the spell just as Trevor defeats the last of the demons, her struggle against the castle's mechanisms causing the castle to teleport within Br\u0103ila, landing in the river with most of the vampires of both factions killed by the holy water flooding into the castle.

Dracula retreats to his study with Isaac, whom he sends through his magic mirror back to the desert to save the human from sacrificing himself to defend Dracula from death. Alucard reaches the study and attacks Dracula, backed by Trevor and Sypha. The group manages to inflict some damage, but Dracula overpowers them, and engages in hand-to-hand combat with Alucard, moving through the castle as they battle. Eventually the two end up in Alucard's childhood room where Dracula has a break down upon realizing the reality of him trying to kill his own son. Dracula allows Alucard to stake him through the heart, while Trevor arrives to decapitate the decomposing vampire and Sypha burns the remains, leaving only his wedding ring intact.

In Br\u0103ila, Carmilla decides to return to [[Styria]], enslaving Hector for his skills to quickly rebuild her forces and take advantage of the power vacuum left by Dracula's demise. Sypha convinces Trevor to stay with her and join her on new adventures battling monsters, and they bid farewell to Alucard and set off to find the Speakers.

Frederator brought writer [[Warren Ellis]] aboard as the screenwriter for the series. In an interview with ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', Warren Ellis said that when he was contacted about ''Castlevania'' he had no previous knowledge of the series and discovered it was a \"Japanese transposition of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror films]] I grew up with and loved\".<ref name=\"paste magazine\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/warren-ellis-on-castlevania-the-legacy-of-hammer-h.html |title=Warren Ellis on Castlevania, the Legacy of Hammer Horror, and the Creative Liberation of Writing for Netflix |first=Toussaint |last=Egan |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 8, 2017 |website=Paste Magazine}}</ref> Ellis explained how he worked with ''Castlevania'' producer [[Koji Igarashi]] to fit the film into the timeline of the series, including writing a new backstory, and how he was frustrated that Igarashi wanted eight full re-writes of pre-production material before giving approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/7/15934226/netflix-castlevania|title=Netflix's new Castlevania series is the most bingeable show at just under 100 minutes|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2017-07-07|website=Polygon|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> Ellis noted that Frederator's Kevin Kolde, who was slated to produce the work, did not want the film to be aimed at children, allowing Ellis to use gruesome imagery and scenes as necessary to tell the story he wanted to write, something that Ellis had found restrictive in working with normal television animation.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nIn adapting the game for the film, Ellis did not want to make a point-for-point adaption, but instead provide some material to flesh out the game's world and elements behind it. At this stage, the film was anticipated to be only 80 minutes long, which Ellis knew would not be enough to tell the full story he wanted, so was able to break apart his script into a trilogy of works, each part having a self-contained [[three-act structure]]; the first part would be to introduce the characters of Dracula, Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard and with a meaningful narrative resolution. In this manner, Ellis noted that if the other two parts were never greenlit, the first work \"doesn't demand the presence of the other two parts for it to work as its own thing\".<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |title=The First Time Warren Ellis Wrote A Castlevania Animation, Ten Years Ago |first=Rich |last=Johnson |date=February 9, 2017 |accessdate=July 11, 2017 |website=[[Bleeding Cool News]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311002425/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |archivedate=March 11, 2017 }}</ref> Due to the limited time, Ellis opted to drop [[Grant DaNasty|Grant Danasty]], a pirate character in the game; Ellis noted that besides \"the stupid name\", he felt the pirate was misplaced in the setting and that the limited run time would not allow him to develop the character fully.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nSometime around 2008, work on the production stalled, and entered [[development hell]].<ref name=\"dtoid\">{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/10-years-of-purgatory-wasn-t-enough-to-keep-netflix-s-castlevania-down-447906.phtml | title = 10 years of purgatory wasn't enough to keep Netflix's Castlevania down | first = Peter | last = Glagowski | date = July 10, 2017 | accessdate = July 10, 2017 | website = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Ellis had completed his script in June 2008, and the show's production blog had said in August 2008 that they were shopping around the idea as a theatrical release, but no further updates followed before the blog was quietly deleted.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nAround 2012, [[Adi Shankar]] was approached to direct a live-action version of Ellis' script.

had to only make a few changes to fit the Netflix format while staying true to the version of the script Konami had accepted.<ref name=\"paste magazine\"/> Shankar was approached with the opportunity

The other is [[haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup N]], which is common throughout [[North Eurasia]].\n\n==Distribution==\nThis haplogroup appears in 80-90% of most populations in [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and it is almost exclusive to that region: M175 is almost nonexistent in Western [[Siberia]], [[Western Asia]], [[Europe]], most of [[Africa]], and the [[Americas]], where its presence may be the result of recent migrations. However, certain subclades of Haplogroup O-M175 do achieve significant frequencies among some populations of [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Oceania]]. For example, one study found it at a rate of 65.81% among the [[Naimans]], a tribe in Kazakhstan,<ref name=\"Ashirbekov2017\"/> even though only the rate among [[Kazakhs]] in general is believed to be about 9% {{harv|Wells et al.|2001}}.\n\nAn association with the spread of [[Austronesian languages]] in late antiquity is suggested by significant  levels of O-M175 among island populations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[East Africa]]n littoral. For example, [[haplogroup O-MSY2.2#O-M50|Haplogroup O-M50]] has even been found in [[Comorian language|Bantu-speaking populations of the Comoros]] along with a single instance of [[haplogroup O-MSY2.2|O-MSY2.2(xM50)]],<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Msaidie, Said|display-authors=etal|title=Genetic diversity on the Comoros Islands shows early seafaring as major determinant of human biocultural evolution in the Western Indian Ocean|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2011|volume=19|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.128|url=http://z6.ifrm.com/4802/123/0/p1009613/Comoros.pdf|accessdate=1 October 2016|pmid=20700146|pmc=3039498}}</ref> while both O-M50 and [[Haplogroup O-K18|O-M95(xM88)]] occur commonly among the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]].<ref name = \"Hurles2005\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hurles | first1 = Matthew E. | last2 = Sykes | first2 = Bryan C. | last3 = Jobling | first3 = Mark A. | last4 = Forster | first4 = Peter | title = The Dual Origin of the Malagasy in Island Southeast Asia and East Africa: Evidence from Maternal and Paternal Lineages | doi = 10.1086/430051| journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 76 | pages = 894\u2013901| year = 2005 | pmid = 15793703 | pmc = 1199379 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tofanelli | first1 = Sergio | last2 = Bertoncini | first2 = Stefania | last3 = Castr\u00ec | first3 = Loredana | display-authors = etal | year = | title = On the Origins and Admixture of Malagasy: New Evidence from High-Resolution Analyses of Paternal and Maternal Lineages | url = | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 26 | issue = 9| pages = 2109\u20132124 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msp120 | pmid = 19535740 | date=September 2009}}</ref> O-M175 has been found in 28.1% of [[Solomon Islander]]s from Melanesia.<ref name = \"Cox2006\" >{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Murray P. |last2=Miraz\u00f3n Lahr |first2=Marta |title=Y-chromosome diversity is inversely associated with language affiliation in paired Austronesian- and Papuan-speaking communities from Solomon Islands |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201350 |year=2006 |pmid=16378340 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.20459}}</ref> 12% of [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] {{harv|Wells et al.|2001}}, 6.8% of [[Kalmyks]]<ref name=\"Malyarchuk2013\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/jhg.2013.108| pmid=24132124|title = Y-chromosome diversity in the Kalmyks at the ethnical and tribal levels| journal=Journal of Human Genetics| volume=58| issue=12| pages=804\u2013811|year = 2013|last1 = Malyarchuk|first1 = Boris| last2=Derenko| first2=Miroslava| last3=Denisova| first3=Galina| last4=Khoyt| first4=Sanj| last5=Wo\u017aniak| first5=Marcin| last6=Grzybowski| first6=Tomasz| last7=Zakharov| first7=Ilya}}</ref> (17.1% of [[Khoshuud]], 6.1% of [[D\u00f6rbet Oirat|D\u00f6rw\u00f6d]], 3.3% of [[Torghut|Torguud]], 0% of [[Buzava|Buzawa]]), 6.2% of [[Altai people|Altaians]] {{harv|Kharkov et al.|2007}}, 4.1% of [[Uzbeks]] on average but Uzbeks from [[Bukhara]] 12.1%, [[Karakalpaks]] (Uzbekistan) 11.4%, Sinte (Uzbekistans) 6.7%{{harv|Wells et al.|2001}} and 4.0% of [[Buryats]].<ref name = \"Kharkov2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kharkov | first1 = V.

However, nearly all of the purported Korean O-M175(xM119,M95,M122) Y-chromosomes may belong to [[Haplogroup O-M176 (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup O-M176]],<ref group=Note>O-M175(xM119,M95,M122) is sometimes incorrectly called \"O*\".</ref> and later studies do not support the finding of O-M175* among similar population samples ({{harvnb|Xue|2005}}, {{harvnb|Kim|2011}}).

This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being, above all, timely.  The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c63;\"|'''YCC 2002/2008

It is primarily found among populations in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. It also is found in various percentages of populations of the [[Russian Far East]], [[South Asia]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Oceania]], [[Madagascar]], and the [[Comoros]]. Haplogroup O is a primary descendant of haplogroup [[haplogroup NO (Y-DNA)|NO-M214]].\n\nThe O-M175 haplogroup is very common amongst males from [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. It has two primary branches: O1&nbsp;(O-F265) and [[haplogroup O-M122|O2]]&nbsp;(O-M122). O1 is found at high frequencies amongst males native to [[Southeast Asia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], [[Madagascar]] and some populations in [[South China|southern China]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic speakers]] of [[India]]. It's also high in the Melanesian populations of [[Solomon Islander]], [[Fijians]], [[Moluccas]] and significant frequencies in some populations [[Papua New Guinea]]. O2 is found at high levels amongst [[Han Chinese]], [[Tibeto-Burman language|Tibeto-Burman]] populations (including many of those in [[Yunnan]], [[Tibet]], [[Myanmar]], [[Northeast India]], and [[Nepal]]), [[Manchu]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], [[Korean people|Koreans]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Malay people|Malays]], [[Filipinos]], [[Thailand]], [[Polynesians]], the [[Naimans|Naiman]] tribe of [[Kazakhs]] in [[Kazakhstan]],<ref name = \"Ashirbekov2017\">E.

The other is [[haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup N]], which is common throughout [[North Eurasia]].\n\n==Distribution==\nThis haplogroup appears in 80-90% of most populations in [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and it is almost exclusive to that region: M175 is almost nonexistent in Western [[Siberia]], [[Western Asia]], [[Europe]], most of [[Africa]], and the [[Americas]], where its presence may be the result of recent migrations. However, certain subclades of Haplogroup O-M175 do achieve significant frequencies among some populations of [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Oceania]]. For example, one study found it at a rate of 65.81% among the [[Naimans]], a tribe in Kazakhstan,<ref name=\"Ashirbekov2017\"/> even though only the rate among [[Kazakhs]] in general is believed to be about 9% {{harv|Wells et al.|2001}}.\n\nAn association with the spread of [[Austronesian languages]] in late antiquity is suggested by significant  levels of O-M175 among island populations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[East Africa]]n littoral. For example, [[haplogroup O-MSY2.2#O-M50|Haplogroup O-M50]] has even been found in [[Comorian language|Bantu-speaking populations of the Comoros]] along with a single instance of [[haplogroup O-MSY2.2|O-MSY2.2(xM50)]],<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Msaidie, Said|display-authors=etal|title=Genetic diversity on the Comoros Islands shows early seafaring as major determinant of human biocultural evolution in the Western Indian Ocean|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2011|volume=19|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.128|url=http://z6.ifrm.com/4802/123/0/p1009613/Comoros.pdf|accessdate=1 October 2016|pmid=20700146|pmc=3039498}}</ref> while both O-M50 and [[Haplogroup O-K18|O-M95(xM88)]] occur commonly among the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]].<ref name = \"Hurles2005\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hurles | first1 = Matthew E. | last2 = Sykes | first2 = Bryan C. | last3 = Jobling | first3 = Mark A. | last4 = Forster | first4 = Peter | title = The Dual Origin of the Malagasy in Island Southeast Asia and East Africa: Evidence from Maternal and Paternal Lineages | doi = 10.1086/430051| journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 76 | pages = 894\u2013901| year = 2005 | pmid = 15793703 | pmc = 1199379 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tofanelli | first1 = Sergio | last2 = Bertoncini | first2 = Stefania | last3 = Castr\u00ec | first3 = Loredana | display-authors = etal | year = | title = On the Origins and Admixture of Malagasy: New Evidence from High-Resolution Analyses of Paternal and Maternal Lineages | url = | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 26 | issue = 9| pages = 2109\u20132124 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msp120 | pmid = 19535740 | date=September 2009}}</ref> O-M175 has been found in 28.1% of [[Solomon Islander]]s from Melanesia.<ref name = \"Cox2006\" >{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Murray P. |last2=Miraz\u00f3n Lahr |first2=Marta |title=Y-chromosome diversity is inversely associated with language affiliation in paired Austronesian- and Papuan-speaking communities from Solomon Islands |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201350 |year=2006 |pmid=16378340 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.20459}}</ref> 12% of [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] {{harv|Wells et al.|2001}}, 6.8% of [[Kalmyks]]<ref name=\"Malyarchuk2013\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/jhg.2013.108| pmid=24132124|title = Y-chromosome diversity in the Kalmyks at the ethnical and tribal levels| journal=Journal of Human Genetics| volume=58| issue=12| pages=804\u2013811|year = 2013|last1 = Malyarchuk|first1 = Boris| last2=Derenko| first2=Miroslava| last3=Denisova| first3=Galina| last4=Khoyt| first4=Sanj| last5=Wo\u017aniak| first5=Marcin| last6=Grzybowski| first6=Tomasz| last7=Zakharov| first7=Ilya}}</ref> (17.1% of [[Khoshuud]], 6.1% of [[D\u00f6rbet Oirat|D\u00f6rw\u00f6d]], 3.3% of [[Torghut|Torguud]], 0% of [[Buzava|Buzawa]]), 6.2% of [[Altai people|Altaians]] {{harv|Kharkov et al.|2007}}, 4.1% of [[Uzbeks]] on average but Uzbeks from [[Bukhara]] 12.1%, [[Karakalpaks]] (Uzbekistan) 11.4%, Sinte (Uzbekistans) 6.7%{{harv|Wells et al.|2001}} and 4.0% of [[Buryats]].<ref name = \"Kharkov2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kharkov | first1 = V.

This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being, above all, timely.  The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c63;\"|'''YCC 2002/2008
