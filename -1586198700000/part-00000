He was second in a succession of three generations of U.S. Naval officers: his father, [[rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Royal R. Ingersoll]] -  [[United States Naval Academy]] class of 1868, and his son, [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[Royal Rodney Ingersoll II]] - USNA  class of 1934, was killed in a \"[[Friendly fire|friendly fire]]\" accident on board the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|3}} on 4 June 1942, during the naval [[Battle of Midway]].\n\n==1905\u20131937==\n\nIngersoll graduated from the Naval Academy in 1905 and reported as a [[passed midshipman]] to the [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|3}}. In August of that year, he was one of the young officers assigned special temporary duty to attend the [[Russia]]n-[[Japan]]ese Peace Conference, held at the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], in [[Kittery, Maine]]. When detached from the ''Missouri'' in May 1906, he was assigned briefly to the {{USS|Marietta|PG-15|3}}, and later the {{USS|Hancock|AP-3|3}}, then assisted in fitting out the {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|3}} at the [[New York Navy Yard]]. He served on board that battleship from her commissioning on 29 September 1906, until October 1907.\n\nIngersoll served as an instructor of Seamanship and International Law, and later of English, at the Naval Academy between 1911 and 1913, preceding his assignment to the [[Asiatic Squadron]]. There he joined the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Saratoga|ACR-2|3}}, the [[flagship]] of the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|U.S. Asiatic Fleet]]. He served briefly as her First Lieutenant, and then he became the Aide and Flag Lieutenant to the Chief-of-Staff of the Asiatic Fleet's Commander.\n\nHe returned to the United States, and on 1 June 1916, reported as Assistant for Communications, and Communication Officer, in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Navy Department. Concerning that assignment, he subsequently wrote: \"The work in this office began to pick up as the tension in the diplomatic relations with Germany increased, and overwhelmed us on 2 February 1917, when diplomatic relations with that country were broken....\" For organizing the greatly expanded Naval Communications Office during [[World War I]], he was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] and cited \"for distinguished service in the line of his profession in organizing, developing, and administering the Communication Office of the Navy Department.\"\n\nAfter the Armistice in November 1918, he was ordered to join Admiral [[William S. Benson]], USN, then Chief of Naval Operations, concerning the establishment of a communication office for that commission. In February 1919, he returned home in the {{USS|George Washington|1908|2}} with the Presidential party, handling messages for President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on the voyage across the Atlantic.\n\nIn March 1919 he again joined the ''Connecticut'', serving this time as her Executive Officer until September 1920, then transferring to the {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|3}}. In June 1921, he reported to the Navy Department for a tour of duty in the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], and on 26 March 1924, assumed command of the {{USS|Nokomis|SP-609|3}}. Under his command, that [[gunboat]] was fitted out as a [[survey ship]] and cruised in the [[Cuba]]n\u2013[[Haiti]]an area, making new charts of the north coast of Cuba.\n\nCompleting the Senior Course at the [[Naval War College]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in June 1927, he served the following year as a member of that staff. In June 1928, he reported for duty as Assistant Chief of Staff to Commander [[Battle Fleet]], in the {{USS|California|BB-44|3}} and continued similar duty on the Staff when Admiral [[William V. Pratt]] became Commander in Chief, [[United States Fleet]], with his flag in the {{USS|Texas|BB-35|3}}. In August 1930, he was assigned to the Division of Fleet Training, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Navy Department, where he served until May 1933. He then reported as Commanding Officer of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|3}}, and in November 1933, was transferred to the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] to fit out the {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38|3}}. He commanded this cruiser from her commissioning on 10 February 1934 until June 1935.\n\nThe following three years of duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, as Director of the War Plans Division, included his assignment in June 1936 as Technical Assistant to the American Delegation at the [[London Naval Conference 1935|London Naval Conference]] in 1935 \u2013 36. He again went to London in December 1937, concerned with requirements growing out of the [[London Naval Treaty]] limiting naval armament.\n\n==1938-1946==\n\nOn 16 July 1938, Ingersoll took command of Cruiser Division Six of the [[Scouting Force]], his flag in the cruiser {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|3}}. Two years later, he returned to the Office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] as Assistant to the Chief, and on 1 January 1942, with the rank of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]], he was designated Commander in Chief, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], with the ''Augusta'' as his [[flagship]].\n\nIngersoll was promoted to the rank of admiral on the following 1 July and broke his flag on the converted yacht [[USS Vixen (PG-53)|USS ''Vixen'' (PG-53)]] on 17 July. Having organized the movements of the thousands of ships across the Atlantic to have men and supplies on hand at the precise hour for the [[Operation Torch|North African landings]] in November 1942, he also had the responsibility of planning the composition of the naval escort forces which insured the troop convoys' safe arrival.\n\nFollowing the African invasion, the Atlantic Fleet was employed in running troop [[convoy]]s and transporting stores, munitions, and fuel to the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. As a subsidiary responsibility, it ran the convoys on the coast of [[Brazil]] and continuously waged the [[Battle of the Atlantic|anti-submarine war]] which had been a matter of primary concern since the outbreak of hostilities. Ingersoll is generally credited with solving the [[U-boat]] and Atlantic logistics problems. In addition, he had the responsibility of defense of the Western Hemisphere by U.S. naval forces and made changes in the disposition of air and surface forces stationed at various points in North and South America. For his services in this command, he was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] and cited as a \"forceful and resolute leader under the critical conditions existing throughout a period of approximately three years...against a determined and ruthless enemy intent on world domination....\"\n\nIn November 1944, he was detached from command of the Atlantic Fleet and became Commander [[Western Sea Frontier]], with headquarters at [[San Francisco]]. In addition to commanding the naval forces engaged in protecting shipping in coastal waters, he managed the flow of supplies to the Pacific Fleet through West Coast ports. In carrying out this assignment, he had the status of a Deputy Commander in Chief, [[U.S. Fleet]], and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. After the reorganization of the navy in October 1945, he continued to serve as Commander Western Sea Frontier until 10 April 1946, when he was relieved of all active duty pending his retirement that became official on 1 August 1946.\n\n==Family==\nIngersoll was married in 1910 to Louise Van Harlingen of Atlanta, Georgia and had two children. Ingersoll died on 20 May 1976. In 1979, Mrs. Louise Ingersoll was the sponsor for {{USS|Ingersoll|DD-990}}; their daughter, Alice Jean Ingersoll Nagle, acting as proxy sponsor. Their son, Royal Rodney II, had been (with Admiral Ingersoll's father) the namesake of the {{USS|Ingersoll|DD-652}}.\n\n==Awards==\nIn addition to the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal, Ingersoll was awarded the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]]; the [[American Defense Service Medal]]; [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]]; and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].

These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called \"inner game\" and \"outer game\", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as \"limiting beliefs\"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), [[incel]]s (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss techniques.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087 |title = The Matrix couldn't dream up the internet of 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices among pickup artists.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as \"sarging\", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat \"Sarge\". A pickup artist can \"sarge\" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].<ref name=\"atlantic\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nJeffries employed [[neuro-linguistic programming]] techniques for the purposes of sexual conquest, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s \"Mystery Method\".

Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful pickup artists based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and \"lair\" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the \"Venusian arts\" are informed by an intertwining of \"hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]\". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of \"disciplinarian and ascetic values\", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of gurus often promises an easy, effortless \"quick fix\".<ref name=\"socrates.berkeley.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C.

These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called \"inner game\" and \"outer game\", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as \"limiting beliefs\"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), [[incel]]s (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss techniques.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087 |title = The Matrix couldn't dream up the internet of 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices among pickup artists.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as \"sarging\", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat \"Sarge\". A pickup artist can \"sarge\" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].<ref name=\"atlantic\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nJeffries employed [[neuro-linguistic programming]] techniques for the purposes of sexual conquest, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s \"Mystery Method\". The Mystery Method describes seduction as a linear process involving three stages (establishing attraction, building comfort, and seduction) each of which involves a variety of techniques.<ref name=autogenerated1>Erik von Markovik, \"The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed\", St Martin's Press, 2007</ref>\n\n\"[[Negging]]\", one of von Markovik's most famous and controversial techniques, has been described as the practice of giving a woman a backhanded compliment such as \"nice nails \u2013 are they real?\", to weaken her confidence and therefore render her more vulnerable to seduction,<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/cockblocked-by-redistribution|title = Cockblocked by Redistribution: A Pick-up Artist in Denmark|last = Baker|first = Katie J.M.|date = Fall 2013|work = Dissent Magazine|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> or that depriving a woman of obsequious validation and attention will influence her to seek it from the man who negs her.<ref>Belknap, S.

Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful pickup artists based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and \"lair\" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the \"Venusian arts\" are informed by an intertwining of \"hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]\". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of \"disciplinarian and ascetic values\", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of gurus often promises an easy, effortless \"quick fix\".<ref name=\"socrates.berkeley.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C.

It is commonly used by marketers to track online conversations about products and companies. '''Social media analytics''' also defined as, \u201cthe art and science of extracting valuable hidden insights from vast amounts of semi-structured and unstructured social media data to enable informed and insightful decision making.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Digital analytics for marketing|last=Sponder, Marshall|others=Khan, Gohar F.|isbn=9781138190672|location=New York, NY|oclc=975370877|year = 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Process==\nThere are three main steps in analyzing social media: data identification, [[data analysis]], and information interpretation. To maximize the value derived at every point during the process, analysts may define a question to be answered. The important questions for data analysis are: \"Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How?\" These questions help in determining the proper data sources to evaluate, which can affect the type of analysis that can be performed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Social media Analytics: Techniques and insights for Extracting Business Value Out of Social Media|last=Ganis|first=Matthew|last2=Kohirkar|first2=Avinash|publisher=IBM Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-13-389256-7|location=New York|pages=40\u2013137|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Data identification ===\nData identification is the process of identifying the [[subset]]s of available data to focus on for analysis. Raw data is useful once it is interpreted. After data has been analyzed, it can begin to convey a message. Any data that conveys a meaningful message becomes information. On a high level, unprocessed data takes the following forms to translate into exact message: noisy data; relevant and irrelevant data, filtered data; only relevant data, information; data that conveys a vague message, knowledge; data that conveys a precise message, wisdom; data that conveys exact message and reason behind it. To derive [[wisdom]] from an unprocessed data, we need to start processing it, refine the dataset by including data that we want to focus on, and organize data to identify information. In the context of social media analytics, data identification means \"what\" content is of interest. In addition to the text of content, we want to know: who wrote the text? Where was it found or on which social media venue did it appear? Are we interested in information from a specific locale? When did someone say something in social media?<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAttributes of data that need to be considered are as follows:\n* [[Structure]]: [[Structured data]] is a data that has been organized into a formatted r[[Information repository|epository]] - typically a [[database]] - so that its elements can be made addressable for more effective processing and analysis. The [[unstructured data]], unlike structured data, is the least formatted data.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/structured-data|title=What is structured data? - Definition from WhatIs.com|newspaper=WhatIs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref>\n* [[Language]]: Language becomes significant if we want to know the sentiment of a post rather than number of mentions.\n* [[Region]]: It is important to ensure that the data included in the analysis is only from that region of the world where the analysis is focused on. For example, if the goal is to identify the clean water problems in [[India]], we would want to make sure that the data collected is from [[India]] only.\n* Type of Content: The content of data could be Text (written text that is easy to read and understand if you know the language), [[Photos]] (drawings, simple sketches, or photographs), Audio (audio recordings of books, articles, talks, or discussions), or Videos (recording, live streams).\n* Venue: [[Social media]] content is getting generated in a variety of venues such as news sites and social networking sites (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]]). Depending on the type of project the data is collected for, the venue becomes very significant.\n* Time: It is important to collect data posted in the time frame that is being analyzed.\n* [[Ownership]] of Data: Is the data private or publicly available? Is there any [[copyright]] in the data? These are the important questions to be addressed before collecting data.\n[[File:SocialMediaAnalyticsProcess.png|alt=|thumb|542x542px|<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social media Analytics: Techniques and insights for Extracting Business Value Out of Social Media|last=Ganis|first=Matthew|last2=Kohirkar|first2=Avinash|publisher=IBM Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-13-389256-7|location=New York|pages=247\u2013248|quote=|via=}}</ref> Social media analytics process]]\n\n=== Data analysis ===\n[[Data analysis]] is the set of activities that assist in transforming raw data into insight, which in turn leads to a new base of knowledge and [[business value]]. In other words, data analysis is the phase that takes filtered data as input and transforms that into information of value to the analysts. Many different types of analysis can be performed with social media data, including analysis of posts, [[Sentiment analysis|sentiment]], sentiment drivers, geography, [[Demography|demographics]], etc. The data analysis step begins once we know what problem we want to solve and know that we have sufficient data that is enough to generate a meaningful result. How can we know if we have enough evidence to warrant a conclusion? The answer to this question is: we don't know. We can't know this unless we start analyzing the data. While analyzing if we found the data isn't sufficient, reiterate the first phase and modify the question. If the data is believed to be sufficient for analysis, we need to build a data model.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDeveloping a [[data model]] is a process or method that we use to organize data elements and standardize how the individual data elements relate to each other. This step is important because we want to run a [[computer program]] over the data; we need a way to tell the [[computer]] which words or themes are important and if certain words relate to the topic we are exploring.\n\nIn the analysis of our data, it's handy to have several tools available at our disposal to gain a different perspective on discussions taking place around the topic. The aim here is to configure the tools to perform at peak for a particular task. For example, thinking about a [[word cloud]], if we take a large amount of data around computer professionals, say the \"IT architect\", and built a word cloud, no doubt the largest word in the cloud would be \"architect\". This analysis is also about tool usage. Some tools may do a good job at determining sentiment, where as others may do a better job at breaking down text into a grammatical form that enables us to better understand the meaning and use of various words or phrases. In performing analytic analysis, it is difficult to enumerate each and every step to take on an analytical journey. It is very much an iterative approach as there is no prescribed way of doing things.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe taxonomy and the insight derived from that analysis are as follows:\n* Depth of Analysis: Simple [[descriptive statistics]] based on [[streaming data]], ad hoc analysis on accumulated data or deep analysis performed on accumulated data. This analysis dimension is really driven by the amount of time available to come up with the results of a project. This can be considered as a broad continuum, where the analysis time ranges from few hours at one end to several months at the other end. This analysis can answer following type of questions:\n** How many people mentioned Wikipedia in their tweets? \n** Which [[politician]] had the highest number of likes during the [[Debate|debate]]?\n** Which competitor is gathering the most mentions in the context of [[social business]]?\n* Machine Capacity: The amount of [[Cpu|CPU]] needed to process [[data set]]<nowiki/>s in a reasonable time period. Capacity numbers need to address not only the [[Cpu|CPU]] needs but also the network capacity needed to retrieve data. This analysis could be performed as real-time, near real-time, ad hoc exploration and deep analysis. Real-time analysis in social media is an important tool when trying to understand the public's perception of a certain topic as it unfolding to allow for reaction or an immediate change in course. In near real-time analysis, we assume that data is ingested into the tool at a rate that is less than real-time. Ad hoc analysis is a process designed to answer a single specific question. The product of ad hoc analysis is typically a report or data summary. A deep analysis implies an analysis that spans a long time and involves a large amount of data, which typically translates into a high CPU requirement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Domain of Analysis: The domain of the analysis is broadly classified into external social media and internal social media. Most of the time when people use the term social media, they mean external social media. This includes content generated from popular social media sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]]. Internal social media includes [[Enterprise social networking|enterprise social network]], which is a private social network used to assist communication within business.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.crmswitch.com/social-crm/enterprise-social-network/|title=Enterprise Social Networks Explained|last=Kitt|first=Denise|date=2012-05-24|work=|newspaper=CRM Switch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Velocity|Velocity]] of Data: The velocity of data in social media can be divided into two categories: data at rest and data in motion. [[Dimension|Dimensions]] of velocity of data in motion can answer questions such as: How the sentiment of the general [[Population|population]] is changing about the players during the course of match? Is the crowd conveying positive sentiment about the player who is actually losing the game? In these cases, the analysis is done as arrives. In this analysis, the amount of detail produced is directly correlated to the complexity of the [[analytical tool]] or [[system]]. A highly complex tool produces more amounts of details. The second type of analysis in the context of velocity is an analysis of data at rest. This analysis is performed once the data is fully collected. Performing this analysis can provide insights such as: which of your company's products has the most mentions as compared to others? What is the relative sentiment around your products as compared to a competitor's product?<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Information interpretation ===\nThe insights derived from analysis can be as varied as the original question that was posed in step one of analysis. At this stage, as the nontechnical business users are the receivers of the information, the form of presenting the data becomes important. How could the data make sense efficiently so it could be used in good decision making? [[Visualization (graphics)]] of the information is the answer to this question.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-data-visualization-matters|title=Why data visualization matters|last=Steele|first=Julie|date=2012-02-15|newspaper=O'Reilly Media|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref>\n\nThe best visualizations are ones that expose something new about the underlying [[pattern]]s and relationships contain the data. Exposure of the patterns and understating them play a key role in decision making process. Mainly there are three criteria to consider in visualizing data.\n* Understand the [[audience]]: before building the [[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]], set up a goal, which is to convey great quantities of information in a format that is easily assimilated by the consumer of information. It is important to answer \"Who is the audience?\", and \"Can you assume the audience has the knowledge of terminologies used?\" An audience of experts will have different expectations than a general audience; therefore, the expectations have to be considered.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-three-elements-of-successf|title=The Three Elements of Successful Data Visualizations|newspaper=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> \n* Set up a clear framework: the analyst needs to ensure that the visualization is syntactically and semantically correct. For example, when using an icon, the element should bear resemblance to the thing it represents, with size, color, and position all communicating meaning to the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Storytelling|Tell a story]]: analytical information is complex and difficult to assimilate, thus, the goal of visualization is to understand and make sense of the information. [[Storytelling]] helps the viewer gain insight from the data. [[Visualization (graphics)|Visualization]] should package information into a structure that is presented as a narrative and easily remembered. This is important in many scenarios when the analyst is not the same person as a decision-maker.<ref name=\":1\" />\n{{see also|information visualization}}\n\n== Role in Business Intelligence ==\n\n[[Business intelligence]] (BI) can be described as \"a set of techniques and tools for the acquisition and transformation of raw data into meaningful and useful information for business analysis purposes\".<ref>Adkison, D.

In particular, the involvement of the data mining company [[Cambridge Analytica]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election]] and [[Brexit]] have been representative cases that show the arising dangers of linking social media mining and politics. This has raised the question of [[Data_mining#Privacy_concerns_and_ethics|data privacy]] for individuals and the legal boundaries to be created for data science companies in relevance to politics in the future. Both of the examples listed above demonstrate a future in which big data can change the game of international politics. It is likely politics and technology will evolve together throughout the next century. In the cases with Cambridge Analytica, the effects of social media analytics have resonated throughout the globe through two major world powers, the United States and the U.K. \n\n=== 2016 United States Presidential Election ===\nThe scandal that followed the American presidential election of 2016 was one involving a three-way relationship between Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign, and Facebook. Cambridge Analytica acquired the data of over 87 million<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanna |first1=Mina |last2=Isaak |first2=Jim |title=User Data Privacy: Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Privacy Protection |journal=IEEE |date=14 August 2018 |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=56\u201359 |doi=10.1109/MC.2018.3191268 }}</ref> unaware Facebook users and analyzed the data for the benefit of the Trump campaign. By creating thousands of data points on 230 million U.S. adults, the data mining company had the potential to analyze which individuals could be swayed into voting for the Trump campaign, and then send messages or advertisements to said targets and influence user mindset. Specific target voters could then be exposed to pro-Trump messages without being aware, even, of the political influence settling on them. Such a specific form of targeting in which select individuals are introduced to an above-average amount of campaign advertisement is referred to as \"micro-targeting.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tarran |first1=Brian |title=What can we learn from the Facebook\u2014Cambridge Analytica scandal? |journal=Significance |date=29 May 2018 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=4\u20135 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01139.x }}</ref> There remains great controversy in measuring the amount of influence this micro-targeting had in the 2016 elections. The impact of micro-targeting ads and social media data analytics on politics is unclear as of the late 2010s, as a newly arising field of technology.\n\n\nWhile this was a breach of user privacy, data mining and targeted marketing undermined the public accountability to which social media entities no longer subject, therefore twisting the democratic election system and allowing it to dominated by platforms of \u201cuser-generated content [that] polarized the media\u2019s message.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Santos |first1=Tiago |last2=Lou\u00e7\u00e3 , and Helder Coelho |first2=Jorge |last3=Coelho |first3=Helder |title=The Digital Transformation of the Public Sphere |journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science |date=19 February 2020 |volume=36 |issue=6 |page=778 |pages=778-788 |doi=10.1002/sres.2644 |accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Brexit ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nAnother political event [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] that attracted controversy was Cambridge Analytica's intervention in swaying the Brexit referendum of 2016. A similar case took place in which a breach in Facebook data was acquired by Cambridge Analytica and used to encourage British citizens to vote to leave the European Union in the [[Unlawful campaigning in the 2016 EU referendum| 2016 EU referendum]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Besides Cambridge Analytica, several other data companies such as [[AggregateIQ| AIQ]]{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} and the Cambridge University Psychometric Centre{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} were accused of, then investigated by the British government for their possible abuse of data to promote unlawful campaign techniques for Brexit.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The referendum ended with 51.9% of voters supporting the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

'''Social media analytics''' also defined as, \u201cthe art and science of extracting valuable hidden insights from vast amounts of semi-structured and unstructured social media data to enable informed and insightful decision making.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Digital analytics for marketing|last=Sponder, Marshall|others=Khan, Gohar F.|isbn=9781138190672|location=New York, NY|oclc=975370877|year = 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Process==\nThere are three main steps in analyzing social media: data identification, [[data analysis]], and information interpretation. To maximize the value derived at every point during the process, analysts may define a question to be answered. The important questions for data analysis are: \"Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How?\" These questions help in determining the proper data sources to evaluate, which can affect the type of analysis that can be performed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Social media Analytics: Techniques and insights for Extracting Business Value Out of Social Media|last=Ganis|first=Matthew|last2=Kohirkar|first2=Avinash|publisher=IBM Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-13-389256-7|location=New York|pages=40\u2013137|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Data identification ===\nData identification is the process of identifying the [[subset]]s of available data to focus on for analysis. Raw data is useful once it is interpreted. After data has been analyzed, it can begin to convey a message. Any data that conveys a meaningful message becomes information. On a high level, unprocessed data takes the following forms to translate into exact message: noisy data; relevant and irrelevant data, filtered data; only relevant data, information; data that conveys a vague message, knowledge; data that conveys a precise message, wisdom; data that conveys exact message and reason behind it. To derive [[wisdom]] from an unprocessed data, we need to start processing it, refine the dataset by including data that we want to focus on, and organize data to identify information. In the context of social media analytics, data identification means \"what\" content is of interest. In addition to the text of content, we want to know: who wrote the text? Where was it found or on which social media venue did it appear? Are we interested in information from a specific locale? When did someone say something in social media?<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAttributes of data that need to be considered are as follows:\n* [[Structure]]: [[Structured data]] is a data that has been organized into a formatted r[[Information repository|epository]] - typically a [[database]] - so that its elements can be made addressable for more effective processing and analysis. The [[unstructured data]], unlike structured data, is the least formatted data.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/structured-data|title=What is structured data? - Definition from WhatIs.com|newspaper=WhatIs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref>\n* [[Language]]: Language becomes significant if we want to know the sentiment of a post rather than number of mentions.\n* [[Region]]: It is important to ensure that the data included in the analysis is only from that region of the world where the analysis is focused on. For example, if the goal is to identify the clean water problems in [[India]], we would want to make sure that the data collected is from [[India]] only.\n* Type of Content: The content of data could be Text (written text that is easy to read and understand if you know the language), [[Photos]] (drawings, simple sketches, or photographs), Audio (audio recordings of books, articles, talks, or discussions), or Videos (recording, live streams).\n* Venue: [[Social media]] content is getting generated in a variety of venues such as news sites and social networking sites (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]]). Depending on the type of project the data is collected for, the venue becomes very significant.\n* Time: It is important to collect data posted in the time frame that is being analyzed.\n* [[Ownership]] of Data: Is the data private or publicly available? Is there any [[copyright]] in the data? These are the important questions to be addressed before collecting data.\n[[File:SocialMediaAnalyticsProcess.png|alt=|thumb|542x542px|<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social media Analytics: Techniques and insights for Extracting Business Value Out of Social Media|last=Ganis|first=Matthew|last2=Kohirkar|first2=Avinash|publisher=IBM Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-13-389256-7|location=New York|pages=247\u2013248|quote=|via=}}</ref> Social media analytics process]]\n\n=== Data analysis ===\n[[Data analysis]] is the set of activities that assist in transforming raw data into insight, which in turn leads to a new base of knowledge and [[business value]]. In other words, data analysis is the phase that takes filtered data as input and transforms that into information of value to the analysts. Many different types of analysis can be performed with social media data, including analysis of posts, [[Sentiment analysis|sentiment]], sentiment drivers, geography, [[Demography|demographics]], etc. The data analysis step begins once we know what problem we want to solve and know that we have sufficient data that is enough to generate a meaningful result. How can we know if we have enough evidence to warrant a conclusion? The answer to this question is: we don't know. We can't know this unless we start analyzing the data. While analyzing if we found the data isn't sufficient, reiterate the first phase and modify the question. If the data is believed to be sufficient for analysis, we need to build a data model.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDeveloping a [[data model]] is a process or method that we use to organize data elements and standardize how the individual data elements relate to each other. This step is important because we want to run a [[computer program]] over the data; we need a way to tell the [[computer]] which words or themes are important and if certain words relate to the topic we are exploring.\n\nIn the analysis of our data, it's handy to have several tools available at our disposal to gain a different perspective on discussions taking place around the topic. The aim here is to configure the tools to perform at peak for a particular task. For example, thinking about a [[word cloud]], if we take a large amount of data around computer professionals, say the \"IT architect\", and built a word cloud, no doubt the largest word in the cloud would be \"architect\". This analysis is also about tool usage. Some tools may do a good job at determining sentiment, where as others may do a better job at breaking down text into a grammatical form that enables us to better understand the meaning and use of various words or phrases. In performing analytic analysis, it is difficult to enumerate each and every step to take on an analytical journey. It is very much an iterative approach as there is no prescribed way of doing things.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe taxonomy and the insight derived from that analysis are as follows:\n* Depth of Analysis: Simple [[descriptive statistics]] based on [[streaming data]], ad hoc analysis on accumulated data or deep analysis performed on accumulated data. This analysis dimension is really driven by the amount of time available to come up with the results of a project. This can be considered as a broad continuum, where the analysis time ranges from few hours at one end to several months at the other end. This analysis can answer following type of questions:\n** How many people mentioned Wikipedia in their tweets? \n** Which [[politician]] had the highest number of likes during the [[Debate|debate]]?\n** Which competitor is gathering the most mentions in the context of [[social business]]?\n* Machine Capacity: The amount of [[Cpu|CPU]] needed to process [[data set]]<nowiki/>s in a reasonable time period. Capacity numbers need to address not only the [[Cpu|CPU]] needs but also the network capacity needed to retrieve data. This analysis could be performed as real-time, near real-time, ad hoc exploration and deep analysis. Real-time analysis in social media is an important tool when trying to understand the public's perception of a certain topic as it unfolding to allow for reaction or an immediate change in course. In near real-time analysis, we assume that data is ingested into the tool at a rate that is less than real-time. Ad hoc analysis is a process designed to answer a single specific question. The product of ad hoc analysis is typically a report or data summary. A deep analysis implies an analysis that spans a long time and involves a large amount of data, which typically translates into a high CPU requirement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Domain of Analysis: The domain of the analysis is broadly classified into external social media and internal social media. Most of the time when people use the term social media, they mean external social media. This includes content generated from popular social media sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]]. Internal social media includes [[Enterprise social networking|enterprise social network]], which is a private social network used to assist communication within business.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.crmswitch.com/social-crm/enterprise-social-network/|title=Enterprise Social Networks Explained|last=Kitt|first=Denise|date=2012-05-24|work=|newspaper=CRM Switch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Velocity|Velocity]] of Data: The velocity of data in social media can be divided into two categories: data at rest and data in motion. [[Dimension|Dimensions]] of velocity of data in motion can answer questions such as: How the sentiment of the general [[Population|population]] is changing about the players during the course of match? Is the crowd conveying positive sentiment about the player who is actually losing the game? In these cases, the analysis is done as arrives. In this analysis, the amount of detail produced is directly correlated to the complexity of the [[analytical tool]] or [[system]]. A highly complex tool produces more amounts of details. The second type of analysis in the context of velocity is an analysis of data at rest. This analysis is performed once the data is fully collected. Performing this analysis can provide insights such as: which of your company's products has the most mentions as compared to others? What is the relative sentiment around your products as compared to a competitor's product?<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Information interpretation ===\nThe insights derived from analysis can be as varied as the original question that was posed in step one of analysis. At this stage, as the nontechnical business users are the receivers of the information, the form of presenting the data becomes important. How could the data make sense efficiently so it could be used in good decision making? [[Visualization (graphics)]] of the information is the answer to this question.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-data-visualization-matters|title=Why data visualization matters|last=Steele|first=Julie|date=2012-02-15|newspaper=O'Reilly Media|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref>\n\nThe best visualizations are ones that expose something new about the underlying [[pattern]]s and relationships contain the data. Exposure of the patterns and understating them play a key role in decision making process. Mainly there are three criteria to consider in visualizing data.\n* Understand the [[audience]]: before building the [[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]], set up a goal, which is to convey great quantities of information in a format that is easily assimilated by the consumer of information. It is important to answer \"Who is the audience?\", and \"Can you assume the audience has the knowledge of terminologies used?\" An audience of experts will have different expectations than a general audience; therefore, the expectations have to be considered.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-three-elements-of-successf|title=The Three Elements of Successful Data Visualizations|newspaper=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> \n* Set up a clear framework: the analyst needs to ensure that the visualization is syntactically and semantically correct. For example, when using an icon, the element should bear resemblance to the thing it represents, with size, color, and position all communicating meaning to the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Storytelling|Tell a story]]: analytical information is complex and difficult to assimilate, thus, the goal of visualization is to understand and make sense of the information. [[Storytelling]] helps the viewer gain insight from the data. [[Visualization (graphics)|Visualization]] should package information into a structure that is presented as a narrative and easily remembered. This is important in many scenarios when the analyst is not the same person as a decision-maker.<ref name=\":1\" />\n{{see also|information visualization}}\n\n== Role in Business Intelligence ==\n\n[[Business intelligence]] (BI) can be described as \"a set of techniques and tools for the acquisition and transformation of raw data into meaningful and useful information for business analysis purposes\".<ref>Adkison, D.

In particular, the involvement of the data mining company [[Cambridge Analytica]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election]] and [[Brexit]] have been representative cases that show the arising dangers of linking social media mining and politics. This has raised the question of [[Data_mining#Privacy_concerns_and_ethics|data privacy]] for individuals and the legal boundaries to be created for data science companies in relevance to politics in the future. Both of the examples listed above demonstrate a future in which big data can change the game of international politics. It is likely politics and technology will evolve together throughout the next century. In the cases with Cambridge Analytica, the effects of social media analytics have resonated throughout the globe through two major world powers, the United States and the U.K. \n\n=== 2016 United States Presidential Election ===\nThe scandal that followed the American presidential election of 2016 was one involving a three-way relationship between Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign, and Facebook. Cambridge Analytica acquired the data of over 87 million<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanna |first1=Mina |last2=Isaak |first2=Jim |title=User Data Privacy: Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Privacy Protection |journal=IEEE |date=14 August 2018 |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=56\u201359 |doi=10.1109/MC.2018.3191268 }}</ref> unaware Facebook users and analyzed the data for the benefit of the Trump campaign. By creating thousands of data points on 230 million U.S. adults, the data mining company had the potential to analyze which individuals could be swayed into voting for the Trump campaign, and then send messages or advertisements to said targets and influence user mindset. Specific target voters could then be exposed to pro-Trump messages without being aware, even, of the political influence settling on them. Such a specific form of targeting in which select individuals are introduced to an above-average amount of campaign advertisement is referred to as \"micro-targeting.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tarran |first1=Brian |title=What can we learn from the Facebook\u2014Cambridge Analytica scandal? |journal=Significance |date=29 May 2018 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=4\u20135 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01139.x }}</ref> There remains great controversy in measuring the amount of influence this micro-targeting had in the 2016 elections. The impact of micro-targeting ads and social media data analytics on politics is unclear as of the late 2010s, as a newly arising field of technology. \n\n=== Brexit ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nAnother political event [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] that attracted controversy was Cambridge Analytica's intervention in swaying the Brexit referendum of 2016. A similar case took place in which a breach in Facebook data was acquired by Cambridge Analytica and used to encourage British citizens to vote to leave the European Union in the [[Unlawful campaigning in the 2016 EU referendum| 2016 EU referendum]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Besides Cambridge Analytica, several other data companies such as [[AggregateIQ| AIQ]]{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} and the Cambridge University Psychometric Centre{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} were accused of, then investigated by the British government for their possible abuse of data to promote unlawful campaign techniques for Brexit.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The referendum ended with 51.9% of voters supporting the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

The film was Capra's last feature, and although it was not the commercial success he hoped it would be, he \"gushed about Falk's performance\".<ref name=Fantle/> Falk was nominated for an Oscar for the role.

There is nothing more important to an actor than to know that the one person who represents the audience to you, the director, is responding well to what you are trying to do.\" Falk once recalled how Capra reshot a scene even though he yelled \"Cut and Print,\" indicating the scene was finalized. When Falk asked him why he wanted it reshot: \"He laughed and said that he loved the scene so much he just wanted to see us do it again. How's that for support!\"<ref name=Fantle/>\n\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Falk had mainly supporting movie roles and TV guest-starring appearances. Falk turned in a gem of a performance as one of two cabbies who falls victim to greed in the epic 1963 star-studded comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', although he only appears in the last fifth of the movie. His other roles included the character of Guy Gisborne in the [[Rat Pack]] musical comedy ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (1964), in which he sings one of the film's numbers, and the spoof ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]].\n\n===Early television roles===\n[[File:Peter Falk in Decoy episode The Comeback (2).jpg|thumb|In ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'' (1959)]]\nFalk first appeared on television in 1957, in the dramatic anthology programs that later became known as the \"[[Golden Age of Television]]\".

On ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' he portrayed a [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]-type revolutionary complete with beard who, intoxicated with power, kept seeing his would-be assassins in a newly acquired magic mirror. He starred in two of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s television series, as a gangster terrified of death in a 1961 episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and as a homicidal evangelist in 1962's ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]''.\n\nIn 1961, Falk was nominated for an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/peter-falk|title=Peter Falk|work=Television Academy}}</ref> for his performance in the episode \"Cold Turkey\" of [[James Whitmore]]'s short-lived series ''[[The Law and Mr. Jones]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. On September 29, 1961, Falk and [[Walter Matthau]] guest-starred in the premiere episode, \"The Million Dollar Dump\", of ABC's crime drama ''[[Target: The Corruptors]]'', with [[Stephen McNally]] and [[Robert Harland]]. He won an Emmy for ''The Price of Tomatoes'', a drama carried in 1962 on ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]''.\n\nIn 1963, Falk and [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] appeared as brothers who disagreed on the route for a railroad in \"The Gus Morgan Story\" on ABC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. Falk played the title role of \"Gus\", and Sands was his younger brother, Ethan Morgan. Ethan accidentally shoots wagonmaster Chris Hale, played by [[John McIntire]], while the brothers are in the mountains looking at possible route options. Gus makes the decision to leave Hale behind- even choking him, believing he is dead. Ethan has been overcome with oxygen deprivation and needs Gus' assistance to reach safety down the mountain. Unknown to the Morgans, Hale crawls down the mountain through snow, determined to obtain revenge against Gus. In time, though, Hale comes to understand the difficult choice Morgan had to make, and the brothers reconcile their own differences. This episode is remembered for its examination of how far a man will persist amid adversity to preserve his own life and that of his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/wagon-train-the-gus-morgan-story,44066/|title=The Gus Morgan Story|publisher=avclub.com|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFalk's first television series was in the title role of the drama ''[[The Trials of O'Brien]]'', in which he played a lawyer.

In 1966, he also co-starred in a television production of \"Brigadoon\" with [[Robert Goulet]].\n\nIn 1971, [[Pierre Cossette]] produced the first [[Grammy Awards]] show on television with some help from Falk.

''Cash: the Autobiography'', Harper Collins (1997) p. 197</ref>\n\nThe first episode of ''Columbo'' as a series was directed in 1971 by a 24-year-old [[Steven Spielberg]] in one of his earliest directing jobs. Falk recalled the episode to Spielberg biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]]:\n{{quote|Let's face it, we had some good fortune at the beginning. Our debut episode, in 1971, was directed by this young kid named Steven Spielberg. I told the producers, Link and Levinson: \"This guy is too good for ''Columbo''\"...

Falk first played Columbo in ''Prescription: Murder'', a 1968 TV movie, and the 1970 pilot for the series, ''Ransom for a Dead Man''. From 1971 to 1978, ''Columbo'' aired regularly on NBC as part of the [[wheel series|umbrella series]] ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''. All episodes were of TV movie length, in a 90- or 120-minute slot including commercials. In 1989, the show returned on ABC in the form of a less frequent series of TV movies, still starring Falk, airing until 2003.

Cassavetes guest-starred in the ''Columbo'' episode \"\u00c9tude in Black\" in 1972; Falk, in turn, co-starred with Cassavetes in the 1976 film ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]''. Falk describes his experiences working with Cassavetes, specifically remembering his directing strategies: \"Shooting an actor when he might be unaware the camera was running.\" {{quote|You never knew when the camera might be going. And it was never: 'Stop. Cut. Start again.' John would walk in the middle of a scene and talk, and though you didn't realize it, the camera kept going. So I never knew what the hell he was doing. [Laughs] But he ultimately made me, and I think every actor, less self-conscious, less aware of the camera than anybody I've ever worked with.\"<ref>Carney, Raymond.

Director [[Arthur Hiller]] said during an interview that the \"film started out because [[Alan Arkin]] and Peter Falk wanted to work together. They went to Warner Brother's and said, 'We'd like to do a picture', and Warner said fine&nbsp;... and out came ''The In-laws''&nbsp;... of all the films I've done, ''The In-laws'' is the one I get the most comments on.\"<ref name=Emery/>{{rp|290}} Movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] compared the film with a later remake:\n{{quote|Peter Falk and Alan Arkin in the earlier film, versus Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks this time&nbsp;... yet the chemistry is better in the earlier film.

In ''Wings of Desire'', Falk played a semi-fictionalized version of himself, a famous American actor who had once been an angel, but who had grown disillusioned with only observing life on Earth and had in turn given up his immortality. Falk described the role as \"the craziest thing that I've ever been offered\", but he earned critical acclaim for his supporting performance in the film.<ref name=\"KennyWenders\">{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Falk returned to the New York stage to star in an [[Off-Broadway]] production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]''.

Falk's performance in ''[[Murder, Inc. (1960 film)|Murder, Inc.]]'' (1960) was a turning point in his career. He was cast in the supporting role of killer [[Abe Reles]] in a film based on the real-life [[Murder, Inc.|murder gang of that name]] that terrorized New York in the 1930s.

The film was Capra's last feature, and although it was not the commercial success he hoped it would be, he \"gushed about Falk's performance\".<ref name=Fantle/> Falk was nominated for an Oscar for the role. In his autobiography, Capra wrote about Falk:\n{{quote|The entire production was agony&nbsp;... except for Peter Falk. He was my joy, my anchor to reality.

There is nothing more important to an actor than to know that the one person who represents the audience to you, the director, is responding well to what you are trying to do.\" Falk once recalled how Capra reshot a scene even though he yelled \"Cut and Print,\" indicating the scene was finalized. When Falk asked him why he wanted it reshot: \"He laughed and said that he loved the scene so much he just wanted to see us do it again. How's that for support!\"<ref name=Fantle/>\n\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Falk had mainly supporting movie roles and TV guest-starring appearances. Falk turned in a gem of a performance as one of two cabbies who falls victim to greed in the epic 1963 star-studded comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', although he only appears in the last fifth of the movie. His other roles included the character of Guy Gisborne in the [[Rat Pack]] musical comedy ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (1964), in which he sings one of the film's numbers, and the spoof ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]].\n\n===Early television roles===\n[[File:Peter Falk in Decoy episode The Comeback (2).jpg|thumb|In ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'' (1959)]]\nFalk first appeared on television in 1957, in the dramatic anthology programs that later became known as the \"[[Golden Age of Television]]\". In 1957, he appeared in one episode of ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents]].'' He was also cast in ''[[Studio One (anthology series)|Studio One]],'' ''[[Kraft Television Theater]],'' ''[[New York Confidential (TV series)|New York Confidential]],'' ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]],'' ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]],'' ''[[The Islanders (TV series)|The Islanders]],'' and ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'' with [[Beverly Garland]] cast as the first female police officer in a series lead. On ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' he portrayed a [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]-type revolutionary complete with beard who, intoxicated with power, kept seeing his would-be assassins in a newly acquired magic mirror. He starred in two of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s television series, as a gangster terrified of death in a 1961 episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and as a homicidal evangelist in 1962's ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]''.\n\nIn 1961, Falk was nominated for an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/peter-falk|title=Peter Falk|work=Television Academy}}</ref> for his performance in the episode \"Cold Turkey\" of [[James Whitmore]]'s short-lived series ''[[The Law and Mr. Jones]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. On September 29, 1961, Falk and [[Walter Matthau]] guest-starred in the premiere episode, \"The Million Dollar Dump\", of ABC's crime drama ''[[Target: The Corruptors]]'', with [[Stephen McNally]] and [[Robert Harland]]. He won an Emmy for ''The Price of Tomatoes'', a drama carried in 1962 on ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]''.\n\nIn 1963, Falk and [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] appeared as brothers who disagreed on the route for a railroad in \"The Gus Morgan Story\" on ABC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. Falk played the title role of \"Gus\", and Sands was his younger brother, Ethan Morgan. Ethan accidentally shoots wagonmaster Chris Hale, played by [[John McIntire]], while the brothers are in the mountains looking at possible route options. Gus makes the decision to leave Hale behind- even choking him, believing he is dead. Ethan has been overcome with oxygen deprivation and needs Gus' assistance to reach safety down the mountain. Unknown to the Morgans, Hale crawls down the mountain through snow, determined to obtain revenge against Gus. In time, though, Hale comes to understand the difficult choice Morgan had to make, and the brothers reconcile their own differences. This episode is remembered for its examination of how far a man will persist amid adversity to preserve his own life and that of his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/wagon-train-the-gus-morgan-story,44066/|title=The Gus Morgan Story|publisher=avclub.com|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFalk's first television series was in the title role of the drama ''[[The Trials of O'Brien]]'', in which he played a lawyer. The show ran in 1965 and 1966 and was cancelled after 22 episodes. In 1966, he also co-starred in a television production of \"Brigadoon\" with [[Robert Goulet]].\n\nIn 1971, [[Pierre Cossette]] produced the first [[Grammy Awards]] show on television with some help from Falk.

Rather than a [[whodunit]], the show typically revealed the murderer from the beginning, then showed how the [[Los Angeles]] police detective Columbo went about solving the crime. Falk would describe his role to Fantle:\n{{quote|Columbo has a genuine mistiness about him. It seems to hang in the air\u2026 [and] he's capable of being distracted\u2026 Columbo is an ass-backwards Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had a long neck, Columbo has no neck; Holmes smoked a pipe, Columbo chews up six cigars a day.<ref name=Fantle />}}\n\nTelevision critic Ben Falk (no relation) added that Falk \"created an iconic cop\u2026 who always got his man (or woman) after a tortuous cat-and-mouse investigation\". He also noted the idea for the character was \"apparently inspired by Dostoyevsky's dogged police inspector, Porfiry Petrovich, in the novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.<ref>Falk, Ben.

When [[Lew Wasserman]] (head of Universal Studios) said that Falk is a perfectionist, I don't know whether it was out of affection or because he felt I was a monumental pain in the ass.<ref name = Fantle />}}\n\nWith \"general amazement\", Falk notes: \"The show is all over the world. I've been to little villages in Africa with maybe one TV set, and little kids will run up to me shouting, 'Columbo, Columbo!'\"<ref name = Fantle /> Singer [[Johnny Cash]] recalled acting in one episode, and although he was not an experienced actor, he writes in his autobiography: \"Peter Falk was good to me. I wasn't at all confident about handling a dramatic role, and every day he helped me in all kinds of little ways.\"<ref>Cash, Johnny. ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Harper Collins (1997) p. 197</ref>\n\nThe first episode of ''Columbo'' as a series was directed in 1971 by a 24-year-old [[Steven Spielberg]] in one of his earliest directing jobs. Falk recalled the episode to Spielberg biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]]:\n{{quote|Let's face it, we had some good fortune at the beginning. Our debut episode, in 1971, was directed by this young kid named Steven Spielberg. I told the producers, Link and Levinson: \"This guy is too good for ''Columbo''\"... Steven was shooting me with a long lens from across the street. That wasn't common twenty years ago. The comfort level it gave me as an actor, besides its great look artistically\u2014well, it told you that this wasn't any ordinary director.\"<ref>McBride, Joseph. ''Steven Spielberg: A Biography'', Simon and Schuster (1997) p. 191</ref>}}\n\nThe character of Columbo had previously been played by [[Bert Freed]] in a single television episode of ''The Chevy Mystery Show'' in 1960, and by [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. Falk first played Columbo in ''Prescription: Murder'', a 1968 TV movie, and the 1970 pilot for the series, ''Ransom for a Dead Man''. From 1971 to 1978, ''Columbo'' aired regularly on NBC as part of the [[wheel series|umbrella series]] ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''. All episodes were of TV movie length, in a 90- or 120-minute slot including commercials. In 1989, the show returned on ABC in the form of a less frequent series of TV movies, still starring Falk, airing until 2003.

Cassavetes guest-starred in the ''Columbo'' episode \"\u00c9tude in Black\" in 1972; Falk, in turn, co-starred with Cassavetes in the 1976 film ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]''. Falk describes his experiences working with Cassavetes, specifically remembering his directing strategies: \"Shooting an actor when he might be unaware the camera was running.\" {{quote|You never knew when the camera might be going. And it was never: 'Stop. Cut. Start again.' John would walk in the middle of a scene and talk, and though you didn't realize it, the camera kept going. So I never knew what the hell he was doing.

In ''Wings of Desire'', Falk played a semi-fictionalized version of himself, a famous American actor who had once been an angel, but who had grown disillusioned with only observing life on Earth and had in turn given up his immortality.

It was first released on August 27, 2002, by [[Immortal Records]] and distributed by [[Virgin Records]]. The album was produced by [[Bob Ezrin]], [[Brian Virtue]], and Thirty Seconds to Mars, and was recorded in rural Wyoming during 2001 and early 2002. It had been in the works for a couple of years, with lead vocalist [[Jared Leto]] writing the majority of the songs.\n\n''30 Seconds to Mars'' was described as a [[concept album]] centering on human struggle and self-determination, characterized by personal lyrics that use otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album incorporates progressive sounds with influences and elements from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[space rock]], and [[electronica]]. Upon release, ''30 Seconds to Mars'' received mostly positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who commended the album's lyrical content and the band's musicianship, which has been compared to the works of [[Pink Floyd]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and [[Brian Eno]].\n\nThe album debuted at number 107 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the US [[Top Heatseekers]]. It was a slow-burning success that eventually sold two million copies worldwide. It produced two singles, \"[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]\" and \"[[Edge of the Earth]]\". Thirty Seconds to Mars promoted the album by opening concerts for bands such as [[Puddle of Mudd]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Sevendust]], and [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nBy 1998, Thirty Seconds to Mars was performing gigs at small American venues and clubs. When they first started, lead vocalist [[Jared Leto]] did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.{{sfn|Tagliaferro|2006|p=38}} They played their first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name \"Thirty Seconds to Mars\", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confrontmagazine.com/main/09-2006/library/transcript3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910022910/http://www.confrontmagazine.com/main/09-2006/library/transcript3.html|title=Matt Wachter, Tomo Milicevic \u2013 30 Seconds to Mars|date=June 28, 2006|archivedate=September 10, 2007|work=Confront|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref> During this period, the band recorded demo tracks such as \"Valhalla\" and \"Revolution\", or \"Jupiter\" and \"Hero\", which later appeared on the debut album as \"Fallen\" and \"Year Zero\" respectively, but also \"Buddha for Mary\".{{sfn|Poncet|2002|p=41}} Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to [[Immortal Records]].{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=20}} In 1999, [[Virgin Records]] entered into the contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044420/virgin-sues-30-seconds-to-mars-for-30-million|title=Virgin Sues 30 Seconds To Mars For $30 Million|first=Andre|last=Paine|date=August 18, 2008|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe work of Thirty Seconds to Mars generated the interest of record producer [[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including ''[[The Wall]]'' by [[Pink Floyd]], ''[[Love It to Death]]'' by [[Alice Cooper]], and ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because they felt that he had the ability to help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper.{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=21}} [[Brian Virtue]], who had previously worked with [[Jane's Addiction]], joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.<ref name=\"much\">{{cite web|url=http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/bio.asp?artist=443|title=30 Seconds to Mars|publisher=[[MuchMusic]].

Thirty Seconds to Mars initially thought to exclude the track from the record since they were not satisfied with it, but then they decided to rework the song because there were people who had strong feelings about it.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The track features programming by [[Danny Lohner]] and background vocals by [[Maynard James Keenan]].

Elizabeth Bromstein from ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' magazine described it as a concoction of '80s electronics, [[industrial music]] and [[nu metal]] with a heavy dose of [[progressive rock]].<ref name=\"now\"/> [[Jaan Uhelszki]] of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' felt that the album is made of \"sterner stuff\", with the band's prog-metal foundation \"enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody\".{{sfn|Uhelszki|2002|p=19}} Smiley Ben of [[BBC Collective]] noted in the album [[alternative rock]] tendencies.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> Ryan Rayhill from ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' found the album befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush and opined that Thirty Seconds to Mars \"emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like [[Tool (band)|Tool]] on ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''\", referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd.<ref name=\"blender\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\n''30 Seconds to Mars'' is a [[concept album]] focusing on human struggle and self-determination.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> It deals with characters who battle with social alienation, emotional isolation, and political malaise. The title itself \"30 Seconds to Mars\" indicates the accelerated human society and suggests a potential escapism from it.<ref name=\"much\"/> The album's lyrics describe the personal human experience through the use of metaphors and moments of fantasy. Jared Leto regarded it as a \"very personal album that sometimes uses otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation\".<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> He cited the human struggle as the most inspiring source for the band and explained that the record features \"a definite desire for change, for renewal, for a new beginning and ultimately, for escape\".{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=22}} Author [[Karin Lowachee]] commented that Leto, who wrote most of the lyrics, allows the listener to draw his or her own conclusions to the meanings of the songs. She noted that \"this makes the music especially personal, as whatever images you conjure from the sound and words can be interpreted by your own inner language\".{{sfn|Lowachee|2003|p=5}}\n\n{{Listen|filename=Thirty Seconds to Mars - Buddha for Mary.ogg|title=\"Buddha for Mary\"|description=\"Buddha for Mary\" has been called one of the most ambitious tracks on the album, featuring abstract lyrics and complex rhythm sections.}}\nOpening track \"[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]\" deals with a desire for renewal. Leto, however, stated that he prefers to let the listener take its own understanding and meaning from the song, claiming that the interpretation, from individual to individual, is one of the most interesting aspects of music.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The track \"Fallen\" faces the necessity to escape from the inner world that every person has created for itself.{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=21}} The lyrics of \"Oblivion\", originally titled \"The Reckoning\", lead into a frantic threat, in which \"Unity divides / Division will unite\". Leto described this paradox as a rather common but unfortunate occurrence.<ref name=\"much\"/><ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> A dramatic narration drives \"Buddha for Mary\", whose story is not about a specific person and represents a metaphor. \"End of the Beginning\" features a foreboding tone and emphasizes the human nature in constant search for something.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The album ends with the hidden track \"The Struggle\", whose lyrics were taken from the ancient Chinese military treatise ''[[The Art of War]]'', attributed to [[Sun Tzu]].{{sfn|Lowachee|2003|p=4}}\n\nThe track \"Revolution\", excluded from the final track listing, was considered by some critics as having an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] tone. Leto rejected the claim and explained that it can be taken \"many different ways\" and if taken literally or politically, it could be misinterpreted. He said that the band \"didn't want a song like that to overshadow what we are about\" and especially after the [[September 11 attacks]], they felt it did not fit thematically with the rest of the album, stating that \"it took on new dimensions\".<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The album features elements inspired by the science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]], which influenced the album's songwriting for its themes regarding the interactions of politics, religion, technology, and human emotion.{{sfn|Lowachee|2003|p=5}}\n\n==Packaging==\nThe photography for the album was handled by drummer [[Shannon Leto]], with additional works provided by [[Ken Schles]].<ref name=\"liner notes\"/> The cover art features a teenage boy and some of the band's symbolism. It includes a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] logo, named \"[[Mithra]]\" by the band, that bears the motto \"Provehito in Altum\". Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means \"Launch forth into the deep\". The band chose a phoenix for its association with rebirth and renewal in the [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Jonathan|title=30 Seconds to Mars|url=http://www.prickmag.net/30secondstomarsfeature.html|accessdate=November 20, 2015|work=[[Prick (magazine)|Prick]]|date=August 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124183207/http://www.prickmag.net/30secondstomarsfeature.html|archivedate=November 24, 2005}}</ref> The group expressed interest in signs and symbols and their relationships with cultures and subcultures.<ref name=\"build\"/> The album's cover art was unveiled through the band's official website on July 29, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://30secondstomars.com/html/main.asp?EventDate=all|title=Album Cover Design Finalized|publisher=Virgin Records|date=July 29, 2002|accessdate=November 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031213124704/http://30secondstomars.com/html/main.asp?EventDate=all|archivedate=December 13, 2003 }}</ref> However, it was not conceived to be the original concept for the artwork.

It was first released on August 27, 2002, by [[Immortal Records]] and distributed by [[Virgin Records]]. The album was produced by [[Bob Ezrin]], [[Brian Virtue]], and Thirty Seconds to Mars, and was recorded in rural Wyoming during 2001 and early 2002. It had been in the works for a couple of years, with lead vocalist [[Jared Leto]] writing the majority of the songs.\n\n''30 Seconds to Mars'' was described as a [[concept album]] centering on human struggle and self-determination, characterized by personal lyrics that use otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album incorporates progressive sounds with influences and elements from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[space rock]], and [[electronica]]. Upon release, ''30 Seconds to Mars'' received mostly positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who commended the album's lyrical content and the band's musicianship, which has been compared to the works of [[Pink Floyd]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and [[Brian Eno]].\n\nThe album debuted at number 107 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the US [[Top Heatseekers]]. It was a slow-burning success that eventually sold two million copies worldwide. It produced two singles, \"[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]\" and \"[[Edge of the Earth]]\". Thirty Seconds to Mars promoted the album by opening concerts for bands such as [[Puddle of Mudd]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Sevendust]], and [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nBy 1998, Thirty Seconds to Mars was performing gigs at small American venues and clubs. When they first started, lead vocalist [[Jared Leto]] did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.{{sfn|Tagliaferro|2006|p=38}} They played their first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name \"Thirty Seconds to Mars\", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confrontmagazine.com/main/09-2006/library/transcript3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910022910/http://www.confrontmagazine.com/main/09-2006/library/transcript3.html|title=Matt Wachter, Tomo Milicevic \u2013 30 Seconds to Mars|date=June 28, 2006|archivedate=September 10, 2007|work=Confront|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref> During this period, the band recorded demo tracks such as \"Valhalla\" and \"Revolution\", or \"Jupiter\" and \"Hero\", which later appeared on the debut album as \"Fallen\" and \"Year Zero\" respectively, but also \"Buddha for Mary\".{{sfn|Poncet|2002|p=41}} Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to [[Immortal Records]].{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=20}} In 1999, [[Virgin Records]] entered into the contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044420/virgin-sues-30-seconds-to-mars-for-30-million|title=Virgin Sues 30 Seconds To Mars For $30 Million|first=Andre|last=Paine|date=August 18, 2008|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe work of Thirty Seconds to Mars generated the interest of record producer [[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including ''[[The Wall]]'' by [[Pink Floyd]], ''[[Love It to Death]]'' by [[Alice Cooper]], and ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because they felt that he had the ability to help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper.{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=21}} [[Brian Virtue]], who had previously worked with [[Jane's Addiction]], joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.<ref name=\"much\">{{cite web|url=http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/bio.asp?artist=443|title=30 Seconds to Mars|publisher=[[MuchMusic]].

Thirty Seconds to Mars initially thought to exclude the track from the record since they were not satisfied with it, but then they decided to rework the song because there were people who had strong feelings about it.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The track features programming by [[Danny Lohner]] and background vocals by [[Maynard James Keenan]].

Elizabeth Bromstein from ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' magazine described it as a concoction of '80s electronics, [[industrial music]] and [[nu metal]] with a heavy dose of [[progressive rock]].<ref name=\"now\"/> [[Jaan Uhelszki]] of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' felt that the album is made of \"sterner stuff\", with the band's prog-metal foundation \"enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody\".{{sfn|Uhelszki|2002|p=19}} Smiley Ben of [[BBC Collective]] noted in the album [[alternative rock]] tendencies.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> Ryan Rayhill from ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' found the album befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush and opined that Thirty Seconds to Mars \"emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like [[Tool (band)|Tool]] on ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''\", referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd.<ref name=\"blender\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\n''30 Seconds to Mars'' is a [[concept album]] focusing on human struggle and self-determination.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> It deals with characters who battle with social alienation, emotional isolation, and political malaise. The title itself \"30 Seconds to Mars\" indicates the accelerated human society and suggests a potential escapism from it.<ref name=\"much\"/> The album's lyrics describe the personal human experience through the use of metaphors and moments of fantasy. Jared Leto regarded it as a \"very personal album that sometimes uses otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation\".<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> He cited the human struggle as the most inspiring source for the band and explained that the record features \"a definite desire for change, for renewal, for a new beginning and ultimately, for escape\".{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=22}} Author [[Karin Lowachee]] commented that Leto, who wrote most of the lyrics, allows the listener to draw his or her own conclusions to the meanings of the songs. She noted that \"this makes the music especially personal, as whatever images you conjure from the sound and words can be interpreted by your own inner language\".{{sfn|Lowachee|2003|p=5}}\n\n{{Listen|filename=Thirty Seconds to Mars - Buddha for Mary.ogg|title=\"Buddha for Mary\"|description=\"Buddha for Mary\" has been called one of the most ambitious tracks on the album, featuring abstract lyrics and complex rhythm sections.}}\nOpening track \"[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]\" deals with a desire for renewal. Leto, however, stated that he prefers to let the listener take its own understanding and meaning from the song, claiming that the interpretation, from individual to individual, is one of the most interesting aspects of music.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The track \"Fallen\" faces the necessity to escape from the inner world that every person has created for itself.{{sfn|LaGambina|2002|p=21}} The lyrics of \"Oblivion\", originally titled \"The Reckoning\", lead into a frantic threat, in which \"Unity divides / Division will unite\". Leto described this paradox as a rather common but unfortunate occurrence.<ref name=\"much\"/><ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> A dramatic narration drives \"Buddha for Mary\", whose story is not about a specific person and represents a metaphor. \"End of the Beginning\" features a foreboding tone and emphasizes the human nature in constant search for something.<ref name=\"shoutweb\"/> The album ends with the hidden track \"The Struggle\", whose lyrics were taken from the ancient Chinese military treatise ''[[The Art of War]]'', attributed to [[Sun Tzu]].{{sfn|Lowachee|2003|p=4}}\n\nThe track \"Revolution\", excluded from the final track listing, was considered by some critics as having an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] tone. Leto rejected the claim and explained that it can be taken \"many different ways\" and if taken literally or politically, it could be misinterpreted.
