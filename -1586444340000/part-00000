He was made co-ruler by his father, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], in 1098.\n\nIn Emperor Henry IV's conflicts with the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] and the [[Investiture Controversy|struggle]] against the reform papacy, young Henry V allied himself with the opponents of his father. He forced Henry IV to abdicate on 31 December 1105 and ruled for five years in compliance with the imperial princes. He tried, unsuccessfully, to withdraw the [[regalia]] from the bishops and in order to at least preserve the previous right to invest he captured [[Pope Paschal II]] and forced him to perform his imperial coronation in 1111. Once crowned emperor, Henry departed from joint rule with the princes and resorted to earlier Salian autocratic rule. After he had failed to increase control over the church, the princes in Saxony and on the Middle and Lower Rhine, in 1121 the imperial princes forced Henry V to consent with the papacy. He surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers, and in 1122 he and [[Pope Callixtus II]] ended the Investiture Controversy in the [[Concordat of Worms]].\n\n==Life==\n===Imperial crisis===\n\nHenry V was probably born on August 11th in 1081 or 1086.{{efn|Richard Gaettens suggests the year 1086: The birth year of Heinrich V. 1081 or 1086?

This ceremony usually took place at the age of 15.<ref name=\"Kleinhenz2004\"/>\n\nThree children of Henry IV and his wife [[Bertha of Savoy]] (died in 1087), Henry and his two older siblings, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] and [[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], survived childhood; two other siblings had died early. Henry seems to have spent the first years of his life primarily in [[Regensburg]]. His mentor was [[Conrad (bishop of Utrecht)|Conrad]] Bishop of Utrecht.<ref name=\"Weinfurter2006\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Canossa: die Entzauberung der Welt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Njz-yD1wkkC|year=2006|publisher=C.H.Beck|isbn=978-3-406-53590-1}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of Henry's birth, his father, emperor Henry IV, had already been engaged in many years of drawn out conflicts with the pope, the imperial bishops, and secular princes for the preservation of his rule. Henry IV had never paid much attention to the advice, or the rights and privileges of the landed nobility.<ref name=unhe/> [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], as the centre of resistance, was joined by the southern duchies of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. These southern duchies again sought the support of [[Pope Gregory VII]], the chief advocate of church reform ideas. Gregory's central demand was that the emperor must refrain from investing abbots and bishops, a practice that had been essential for the [[Imperial Church System]] since Emperor [[Otto I]]. Gregory VII [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] Henry IV in 1077. By [[Road to Canossa|repenting at Canossa]], Henry managed to get absolved. In 1080 and 1094, however, Henry IV was excommunicated again. In 1102, the church ban was again declared over him and his party, including his son, Henry V. The conflict divided the empire from the church.<ref name=\"Weinfurter2006\"/>\n\nHenry IV therefore sought to strengthen his influence in the south. His daughter, Agnes, was engaged to [[Frederick I, Duke of Swabia|Friedrich]], who in 1079 obtained the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. The emperor also sought to secure his royal succession. Henry IV chose his eldest son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]], to be his heir and arranged to have Conrad crowned king in Aachen in 1087. After Conrad defected to the ''Church Reform Party'' in Italy in 1093, his royalty and inheritance were revoked at a court in Mainz and transferred to his younger brother, Henry V, in May 1098. The latter had to take an oath never to rule over the father. On January 6, 1099, Henry V was crowned king in [[Aachen]], where he was required to repeat the oath. His brother, Conrad, died in [[Florence]] on July 27, 1101. The continued existence of the Salian dynasty now depended on Henry V, the only living son of the emperor. The co-regency of son and father proceeded without obvious problems for six years. Contrary to previous ruling sons, Henry V was not involved in government affairs. His father's policies proceeded to be extremely cautious after the death of his older son, Conrad.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\">{{cite book|author1=Bernd Schneidm\u00fcller|author2=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Die deutschen Herrscher des Mittelalters: historische Portraits von Heinrich I. bis Maximilian I.

Stefan Weinfurter argues that religious reform motives and the corrosive influence of a group of young Bavarian counts - [[Diepold III, Margrave of Vohburg|Margrave Diepold III von Vohburg]], Count [[Berengar II of Sulzbach]] and Count Otto von Habsburg-Kastl - are the primary causes. These nobles succeeded in convincing the young Henry V of his father's lost cause and the eventual triumph of reform. If he did not act and waited until his father died, someone else would attempt to ascend the throne and would find many supporters. Out of concern for his salvation, Henry then abandoned his father and joined the \"salvation community\" of the young Bavarians.<ref name=rege>{{cite web |url=http://www.regesta-imperii.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Regesta_Imperii_Beiheft_34.pdf |title= Heinrich V. in seiner Zeit |publisher= Regesta  | date=   | author=Gerhard Lubich  | accessdate= February 3, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAnother line of research supports the theory that the murder of Sieghard of Burghausen in February 1104 by [[Ministerialis|ministerials]] and citizens of Regensburg was the trigger for the overthrow of Henry IV. According to Burghausen's relatives and other nobles, the emperor had failed to punish the perpetrators appropriately, proving that Henry IV viewed aristocrats with disdain. Henry V had attempted in vain to mediate an amicable settlement between Burghausen and the ministerials in the dispute that led to the murder, and he also would have had a reason to resent his father's inaction. A flaw in this theory is that there was a very long time lag between the murder of Burghausen and when Henry V turned his back on his father.<ref name=rege/><ref name=\"St\u00fcrner2019\">{{cite book|author=Wolfgang St\u00fcrner|title=Die Staufer: Eine mittelalterliche Herrscherdynastie - Bd. 1: Aufstieg und Machtentfaltung (975 bis 1190)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5y6DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT446|date=30 October 2019|publisher=[[Kohlhammer Verlag]]|isbn=978-3-17-035365-7|pages=446\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1104, Henry V had joined his father's army on a punitive expedition against Saxon Reformers who had opposed the election of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Archbishop of Magdeburg]]. On December 12, 1104, Henry V broke away from his father, thereby breaking the oath of allegiance to the ruling king. Henry V made his way to Regensburg, where he celebrated Christmas with his followers. While there, his father's enemies sought to convince him to revolt. Henry considered their arguments, but he was restrained by the oath he had taken to take no part in the business of the Empire during his father's lifetime. At the turn of the year 1104/05, he sent messengers to Rome to seek absolution from his loyalty oath by [[Pope Paschal&nbsp;II]],<ref name=\"Kleinhenz, pg. 492\"/> The Pope promised Henry V, on condition that Henry be a righteous king and a promoter of the Church, not only absolution from the sin of breaking this oath, but also support in the struggle against his father.<ref name=unhe>{{cite web |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/vuf/article/view/17900/11708 |title= Noch einmal zu den Vorw\u00fcrfen gegen Heinrich IV.

Henry V began to strengthen his ties with Saxony, where the opposition against his father was particularly strong due in part to his absence from the duchy since 1089. In the spring of 1105, Henry V stayed in Saxony for two months and showed his willingness to work with the church on the basis of ''Gregorian'' ideas by removing the bishops, Friedrich von Halberstadt, Udo von Hildesheim, and Henry von Paderborn, who had been appointed by his father. In [[Quedlinburg]], he entered the town barefoot on Palm Sunday, thus demonstrating his humility (''humilitas''), an elementary Christian virtue of rulers. His stay concluded with the celebration of the Pentecost festival in [[Merseburg]] and the confirmation of the Magdeburg [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]].<ref name=unhe/><ref>Holland, A.

By the end of October 1105, Henry V arrived at [[Speyer]], the centre of Salian rule. There, he installed Gebhard, a fervent opponent of his father, as [[Bishop of Speyer|Bishop]]. In the fall of 1105, the armies of father and son faced each other at the [[Regen (river)|Regen]] river. However, a battle was prevented by the princes of both sides who wished to find a peaceful solution. At Christmas 1105, an agreement was to be reached at a [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|diet]] in Mainz.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\">{{cite book|author=I. S.

On December 23 in [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], Henry persuaded his father to retreat to a castle for his own protection, as Archbishop [[Ruthard of Mainz]] would refuse to let him into the city. Henry agreed and was lead to [[Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim|B\u00f6ckelheim Castle]], the property of Bishop Gebhard, not for his protection, but for custody. Henry was thrown into the dungeon and was held there ''\"unwashed and unshaven and deprived of any service\"'' over Christmas. At the Reichstag in Mainz, Henry prompted his father to hand over the [[Imperial Regalia|imperial insignia]] (crown, scepter, imperial cross, holy lance and imperial sword). Henry IV then was transferred to [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|Ingelheim]] where he personally was to hand over the imperial insignia and was forced to abdicate on December 31, 1105. Henry V subsequently spread the narrative in which his father had the insignia and his rule voluntarily ceded to him. This distortion of the events implied his strong desire to feign dynastic continuity.<ref name=\"Weinfurter2006\"/>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title= Sites and events between Henry V's desertion on December 12, 1104 and Henry IV's abdication on December 31, 1105\n|align=center\n|width=145\n|File:Ansicht von Regensburg.jpg|[[Regensburg]], where Henry V went first after he had abandoned his father in 1104\n|File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img03 Castle.jpg|In [[Quedlinburg]] Henry V celebrated [[Easter]] holiday in 1105\n|File:Merseburger Dom.jpg|[[Merseburg]], where Henry V spent the 1105 feast of [[Pentecost]]\n|File:Magdeburg, domtsjerke.jpg|In [[Magdeburg]] Henry V confirmed [[Metropolitan bishop]] Henry I of Assel\n|File:20130817Maximilianstrasse Speyer.jpg|In [[Speyer]] Henry V installs his father's opponent [[Bishop of Speyer|Bishop Gebhard]] in October 1105\n|File:Regen bei Imhof.jpg|At the [[Regen (river)|Regen]] river father and son's forces make contact in late 1105, as the imperial princes on both sides propose a retreat\n|File:Dankaerts-Historis-9342.tif|At Koblenz father and son meet in person among a public display of reconciliation\n|File:M\u00e4useturm und Ehrenfels Friedrich Foltz.jpg|At [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] Henry V persuades his father to retreat to a save place\n|File:Schloss B\u00f6ckelheim.jpeg|At ''Castle Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim'' Henry IV's is imprisoned during Christmas 1105\n|File:Mainz-vom-Bonifaziusturm-A-Sankt-Stephan-742-a.jpg|At the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|diet]] of Mainz Henry V orders emperor Henry IV to surrender his regalia\n|File:Digitale Rekonstruktion - Geometrische Ausmalung, Innenansicht.jpg|At the [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim]] Henry IV is forced to abdicate on December 31, 1105\n|File:Herrschafts\u00fcbergabe von Heirich IV. an Heinrich V.jpg|''Henry IV bestows the royal insignia on his son Henry V'', Idealized depiction of the historical facts, that include Henry IV's imprisonment, seizure of his regalia and forced abdication\n}}\n\nOn January 5 or 6, 1106, more than fifty imperial princes were present when Henry V was anointed and crowned king.

The re-burial at the Speyer crypta would imply continuity and help stabilize the position of the rebel son, who could ''present himself as a legitimate force of conservation and progress''. Again the body was only buried temporarily on September 3, 1106 in a still unconsecrated chapel north of Speyer cathedral.

In order to find greater consent with the nobility he would summon [[Hoftag|diets (''Hoftage'')]]. The princes' participation in great numbers at the diets and the strong increase in chroniclers' reports confirm the new sense of responsibility among the king's vasalls for the empire. Henry V reinstalled the bishops who had been banned from entering their [[diocese|bishoprics]] under his father. Negotiations with the Pope now took place among representatives of the clerics and secular princes. Bishop Eberhard von Eichst\u00e4tt (until his early death in 1112), Count Berengar II of Sulzbach and Count Palatine Gottfried of Calw were particularly close to the young king and are most frequently mentioned by the worldly nobles in the royal documents.

Upon the selection of the bishops, the king only sought the consent of an exclusive circle of a few noble families. These families in turn only campaigned for candidates among their own ranks, who might become important in the future expansion of their respective territories.

The papal party who had supported Henry in his resistance to his father hoped he would endorse the papal decrees, which had been renewed by [[Paschal&nbsp;II]] at the synod of [[Guastalla]] in&nbsp;1106. The king, however, continued to invest the bishops, but wished the pope to hold a council in Germany to settle the question.

The matter slumbered until&nbsp;1110, when, negotiations between king and pope having failed, Paschal renewed his decrees.\n\nAt a ''[[Hoftag]]'' in August 1110 concrete plans were made for a march on Rome and arrangements to bring about an honorable end to the investiture dispute. The army chose the shortest route via the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], reached [[Piacenza]] and [[Parma]], then moved to Florence, arrived at [[Sutri]] in February 1111 and from there proceeded towards Rome.\n\nHenry ''was imbued with ideas of an epochal event'' upon his departure for Italy.<ref name=wei175>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/31120508/Stefan_Weinfurter_Das_Jahrhundert_der_Salier_1024-1125_ |title=  Das Jahrhundert der Salier (1024-1125) Seite 175| publisher =  Academia  |date=   |author=Stefan Weinfurter  |accessdate= February 4, 2020  }}</ref> He signalled preparedness as he ordered a new royal seal to be made.

This impressive display of integrity proved that even the clans that had opposed and violently fought Henry's father were now on the Salian side. Welf's presence was particularly important for Henry as he had been married to [[Matilda of Tuscany]] from 1089 to 1095, which entitled him to inheritance claims on her vast property. Matilda allowed the troops to traverse her substantial territories in the greater part of Northern Italy, that included  present-day [[Lombardy]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], the [[Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]].<ref name=\"RogersFrance2010\">{{cite book|author1=Clifford J.

This honor, that determined the rank of the king was an idea, that had developed among the latest Salians towards a concept of lordship from which also future imperial claims on Southern Italy and on Matilda's property were derived. Matilda,  who in 1079 had indeed intended to bequeath all her property to the pope in the event of her childlessness, now opted for an agreement between the pope and the king, and deployed the name '''''Henry'''''.

He was allegedly accompanied by a huge army of 30,000 knights from all over the empire, that according to [[Otto of Freising]], gave an ''impressive display of worldly power in the nightly glow of the torches''. The strength of his forces helped him to secure general recognition in [[Lombardy]], where [[Grossolano|archbishop Grossolano]] intended to crown him with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].<ref>I.Montanelli;Storia d'Italia Vol 476\u20131250 pag 440, Rizzoli</ref><ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 177\">Comyn, pg. 177</ref> Henry could only command such a large army because his rule was based on consensus with the princes and dukes.

Pope Paschal proposed that Henry give up the investiture altogether - the appointment of bishops to the episcopate - and in return get back all fiefs of sovereign royal [[regalia]] in the duchies and margraviates and the coin - market - and customs rights. Henry and Pope Paschal agreed on this idea in a preliminary contract on February 4, 1111. The bishops were thus deprived of rights and income that had been theirs since the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian era]], with which their service to the king was traditionally made possible and rewarded.<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 177\"/> If these regalia were returned to the empire, the bishops could only live off their own property, the [[tithe]] and alms, limit them to their ministry, that increased their dependence on the Pope. They would have lost all political rights and responsibilities in the empire and be dependent on secular protection. On February 9, Henry V  accepted the papal ''Concordat of Sutri''.

Protests broke out, there was turmoil in the city itself and the coronation had to be cancelled. Henry demanded his investment rights to be reinstated and the immediate coronation. Paschal refused, and Henry seized and imprisoned him in St. Peter. After two months Henry was able to acquire his father's (Henry IV) absolution from Paschal in the ''Treaty of Ponte Mammolo'' on April 12, and the right to invest with ring and staff. On April 13, Paschal completed the imperial coronation. In addition, Paschal had to swear an oath never to excommunicate Henry.<ref name=\"Robinson1990\"/><ref>Bryce, pg. 306</ref>\n\nUpon the Pope's imprisonment, however, Henry lost widespread acknowledgment as he had apprehended Christ's representative, the highest authority in the Latin Christian world. In response, he was banned by cardinal and [[Papal legate|legate]] [[Cuno of Praeneste]] at a synod in Jerusalem in the summer of 1111. In September 1112 he was excommunicated by a Burgundian synod headed by Archbishop Guido of Vienne, the future [[Pope Calixtus II]]. According to scholar Stefan Weinfurter, the year 1111 was a turning point in the reign of Henry V. The recent unity between the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform Church]] and the king broke and with it the ties of consensual rule between the king and the secular princes. In March 1112, the Investiture privilege was revoked by the curia on a [[Lateran council]] and designated as ''depraved privilege'' (''Pravilege'').<ref name=\"Zey2017\">{{cite book|author=Claudia Zey|title=Der Investiturstreit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAHuDQAAQBAJ|date=23 February 2017|publisher=C.H.Beck|isbn=978-3-406-70656-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Hartmann2010\"/><ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\n<!--At [[Sutri]] he concluded an arrangement with Paschal by which he renounced the rite of investiture in return for a promise of coronation and the restoration to the Empire of all Christendom, which had been in the hands of the German state and church since the time of [[Charlemagne]].<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 177\"/> It was a treaty impossible to execute, and Henry, whose consent to it is said to have been conditional on its acceptance by the princes and bishops of Germany, probably foresaw that it would occasion a breach between the German clergy and the pope.\n\nHaving entered Rome and sworn the usual oaths, the king presented himself at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on 12 February 1111 for his coronation and the ratification of the treaty.

On his return from Italy he was a guest of Matilda of Tuscany at Bianello Castle from May 6th to 8th 1111. Matilda and Henry concluded a contract that researchers interpreted as Henry V's document of inheritance in case the margravine dies. On August 7, 1111, Henry was able to finally bring about his father's funeral, who had so far rested in an unconsecrated side chapel of Speyer Cathedral. On the same day and seven days later, on August 14 (a date of significance for the [[liturgy|liturgical]] commemoration of the dead) Henry granted two privileges, which endowed the citizens of Speyer with yet unprecedented civil liberties. As the first privilege lays out memorial ceremonies the privileges for the citizens of the city of Speyer are considered a ''milestone'' in the history of the emergence of civil liberties. The residents were granted numerous rights and benefits (including exemption from inheritance taxes, court taxes and property taxes). No other city in the empire was granted such extensive and far-reaching liberties at the beginning of the 12th century. These privileges highlight the changes in the Salian idea of kingship compared to the first three Salian rulers. Donations no longer applied to the clergy alone, but an entire township was committed to the Salian [[Memorialization]]. The Speyer civil liberties, legal privileges and economic advance were associated with the memory of Henry V.<ref name=and>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269625342_Burgerrecht_Die_Speyrer_Privilegien_von_1111_und_die_Anfange_personlicher_Freiheitsrechte_in_deutschen_Stadten_des_hohen_Mittelalters |title= B\u00fcrgerrecht.

At the funeral, he had presented himself as the loyal son and legitimate heir of the late emperor and demonstrated dynastic continuity. At the same time, he made it clear that his kingship was based not only on his successful rebellion against the father and the approval of the princes, but also on his inheritance claim to the throne. The city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] was also granted generous privileges in 1114, however, unlike in Speyer, the residents were not granted any personal freedoms.<ref>Comyn, pg. 180</ref><ref name=and/>\n\n===Breach of the consensual order and war with Cologne===\n\n[[File:Trifels - aus der Hubschrauberperspektive.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Trifels Castle]] near the modern small town of [[Annweiler am Trifels|Annweiler]].

Shepherd]], 1923]]\nBeginning in 1111, Henry increasingly bypassed the princely consensus for his actions and hardly received any approval. He even applied his father's autocratic forms of government, thus exacerbating the conflict. After the events of 1111, numerous clergymen fell away from him, including first Archbishop [[Conrad I of Salzburg]], Bishop [[Reinhard of Blankenburg|Reinhard of Halberstadt]] and most significant the break with his long-time confidant [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert of Saarbr\u00fccken]], imperial chancellor since February 14, 1106, who had greatly influenced imperial politics. Adalbert was appointed Archbishop of Mainz in 1109 and accompanied Henry on the Italian campaign of 1110/11. In the process of the consolidation and expansion of power, the possessions of the Mainz Church overlapped with the Salian imperial estate at the [[Middle Rhine]]. The conflict with Adalbert apparently arose over [[Trifels Castle]]. Without gaining the consensus of the princes, Henry arrested and detained Adalbert for over three years. Among threats of violence and dissent the Mainz citizens only succeed in November 1115 the archbishop (starved to skin and bones) to be released. The customs of amicable conflict resolution and demonstrative gentleness that had been handed down from the Ottonian era had lost importance under Henry IV and Henry V. Rather, the Salian rulers sought to establish a concrete form of royal punishment. Adalbert became the great opponent of the Salian kingship.<ref name=wei175/>\n\nProperty disputes also led to conflicts in Saxony, as Henry interfered with the princely territorial policy while trying to expand the Salian domain. In 1112, [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]], [[Duke of Saxony]], rebelled against Henry but was quickly subdued. In 1113, after the death of the childless Count Ulrich Margrave of Carniola, numerous Saxon nobles laid claims to this estate. However, Henry had obviously decided that the bequest would fall to the empire if there were no direct heirs. The king's idea nonetheless contradicted the Saxon legal concept and Henry obtained the endowment through approval of the royal princes but he completely avoided any dialogue with the Saxon nobles. Lothair, who rose in arms again was defeated at the ''Battle of Warnstadt'',<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 181\">Comyn, pg. 181</ref> though was later pardoned.<ref name=dend/>\n\nArchbishop [[Frederick I (archbishop of Cologne)|Frederick of Cologne]] also broke with Henry during a campaign against the [[Frisians]], who refused to pay the annual tribute and Henry allegedly sacrificed a Cologne troop contingent to the Frisians. The citizens of Cologne complained about the draconian regiment of one of Henry's [[ministerials]] and Archbishop Friedrich denounced the catastrophic condition of the church in a letter. The episcopal seats of Worms and Mainz remained vacant for years and the secular rights of the bishops were carried out by royal administrators (''villici''). The territorial princes complained as well. From 1113 Henry had begun to adopt the Salian ''practice of occupation'', when for the first time, Burchhard, a [[court chaplain]] was installed as governor of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Diocese of Cambrai]] during the same year. The appointment of Bruning as [[Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim|Bishop of Hildesheim]] and Gerhard as [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Bishop of Merseburg]] also failed to achieve consent with the Saxon nobility.<ref name=mart/><ref>Henderson, Ernest, ''A History of Germany in the Middle Ages'', (Haskell House, 1894), pg. 222</ref>\n\nThe insurgents united behind the Archbishop of Cologne and collectively fell from the emperor in early 1114. Two imperial campaigns against the dissidents failed. Initially, Henry took the fortified town of Deutz, which lay across the Rhine from Cologne. His control of Deutz allowed him to cut Cologne off from all river trade and transportation. At this point, the citizens of Cologne assembled a large force, including bowmen, and crossed the river, formed their ranks, and prepared to meet Henry's army.<ref name=\"rob\"/>  The Cologne bowmen were able to break the armor of Henry's soldiers; it was summer, the weather was sultry, and the soldiers had removed their armor to find relief from the heat. Henry subsequently withdrew, turned south, and sacked Bonn and J\u00fclich. On his return to Deutz, he was met by [[Frederick I (Archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Frederick]], Duke Gottfried of Lorraine,{{clarify|doesn't seem to be equivalent Godfrey (English spelling) after Godfrey IV or V|date=December 2013}} Henry of Zutphen, and Count Theodoric of Aar,{{clarify|Can't find \"Aar\" anyplace except as a river.

After an initial skirmish in which Duke Henry of Lorraine was forced to withdraw, the insurgent's troops and the emperor's force of Swabians, Bavarians, and Franconians clashed. The young men of Cologne, including many journeymen and apprentices, created a fearful din of noise, slashing at all who came near them. Theodric threw his force into the fight, and the emperor's army was forced back.<ref name=\"rob\"/> The defeat at [[Andernach]] ended Henry's presence at the Lower Rhine.\n\nAt Christmas 1114, unrest culminated in Saxony. On February 11, 1115, Duke Lothair eventually defeated Henry in the [[Battle of Welfesholz]], that ended Salian rule in Saxony.<ref>Bisson, Thomas M., ''The Crisis of the Twelfth Century'' (Princeton University Press, 2009), pg. 215</ref> From then on Lothair maintained a near royal rule in Saxony, while Henry's power to uphold universal kingship decreased further. The lack of acceptance and loss of prestige reflected itself at the court as none of the princes attended the ''Hoftag'' on November 1, 1115 in Mainz. Scheduled ''court day''s had to be cancelled in advance due to the lack of confirmed participants. Henry celebrated Christmas of 1115, one of the most essential occasions of royal representation, in Speyer, surrounded by only a few faithful adherents among whom [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Frederick II of Swabia]] gained increasing significance. Simultaneously, Henry's opponents gathered in Cologne upon the invitation of Adalbert of Mainz, to discuss clerical issues.<ref name=zz>{{cite web|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/16897/2/Zoelch.pdf |title=  Die Bisch\u00f6fe von Speyerzur Zeit Kaiser Friedrichs II.| publisher =  Uni Heidelberg  |date=   |author=Karl-Albert Z\u00f6lch  |accessdate= February 10, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=jut/>\n\nThe 1111 events in Rome and the 1115 defeat at the hands of the Saxon opposition led to  the near complete dissolution of all ties between the bishops and the king.

His engagement with the eight-year-old princess [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] took place in Utrecht at Easter of 1110. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] King [[Henry I of England]] paid the extraordinarily high sum of 10,000 or 15,000 pounds of silver as [[dowry]]. In return, his daughter's marriage to Henry V. enormously increased his prestige. On July 25, 1110 Matilda was crowned [[List of German queens|Roman-German Queen]] in Mainz by the Archbishop of Cologne. Four years later the wedding celebrations also took  place in Mainz on January 7, 1114 amid great splendor and the attention of princes from all over the empire. The Salians appropriated the occasion to reaffirm unanimity with the imperial nobles after the conflicts in recent years. Duke Lothair of Supplinburg appeared barefoot and in [[penance|penitent]] clothing at the wedding. He was forgiven for his participation in the inheritance disputes of [[Carniola]] after performing a ''Deditio'' (''submission''). This occasion is the only known case of a ''Deditio'' during Henry V's reign, which historians have compared to the amicable set of rules and conflict management and settlement of the [[Ottonian dynasty]]. On the other hand, Henry had count [[Louis the Springer|Louis of Thuringia]] captured and imprisoned for his participation in the Saxon rebellion, ''which upset many princes''. Henry's impertinent demonstrations of power, greatly diminished the overall atmosphere of the festivity. Some princes left the festival without permission, as others used the opportunity for conspiracies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hist.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:33bf7448-9d88-4b34-8201-90fb17f1ef02/2011_Zey_Mathilde_von_England.pdf |title=  Die Kaiserinnen des Mittelalters | publisher =  Uni Z\u00fcrich |date=   |author=AmalieF\u00f6ssel  |accessdate= February 10, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Borgolte2009\">{{cite book|author=Michael Borgolte|title=Das europ\u00e4ische Mittelalter im Spannungsbogen des Vergleichs: Zwanzig internationale Beitr\u00e4ge zu Praxis, Problemen und Perspektiven der historischen Komparatistik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qatHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT328|date=16 December 2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-05-004829-1|pages=328\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Houts2019\">{{cite book|author=Elisabeth van Houts|title=Married Life in the Middle Ages, 900-1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|date=31 January 2019|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-251974-0|pages=296\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe marriage to Matilda produced no male heirs.

In addition, he wished to stabilize Salian rule in Northern Italy and create a new power base against the overpowering opposition in the northern part of the empire. He had issued a whole series of court documents in advance, with which he intended to present himself as guarantor of law and justice in Italy. Henry was able to obtain Matildas property without any problems and his authority was accepted in all the Italian municipalities. Henry regarded Rome as to be of particular importance and, ardently welcomed, he honored the city with five visits, more than any other Salian king.<ref name=\"K\u00fcss2013\">{{cite book|author=Tobias K\u00fcss|title=Die \u00e4lteren Diepoldinger als Markgrafen in Bayern (1077\u20131204): Adlige Herrschaftsbildung im Hochmittelalter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUkjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA398|date=4 October 2013|publisher=Herbert Utz Verlag|isbn=978-3-8316-4261-8|pages=398\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"St\u00fcrner2019\"/>\n\nPope Paschal died on January 21, 1118.

For a forthcoming ''Hoftag'' in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] and during Henry's absence the royal princes planned the restoration of ''Imperial Peace'' and the deposition of the king in the event of his prolonged absence. Henry abruptly broke off the Italian campaign in the fall of 1118 and returned to the north. His wife Matilda remained in Italy as deputy ruler. Henry was able to prevent the ''court day'' in W\u00fcrzburg. However, his subsequent activities until September/October 1119 can't be determined due to the lack of sources. The feeble compliance with his reign is obvious by the lack of royal documents and the nearly unknown [[itinerarium]] of Henry's court, since apparently nobody ever requested any of these documents.<ref name=fidi>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/14141219/Fidi_milites_Die_Staufer_und_Kaiser_Heinrich_V |title=  Fidi milites?

But [[Jordan, Archbishop of Milan]], excommunicated him at San Tecla. He took possession of Matilda's lands and was gladly received in Rome. By this time Paschal had withdrawn his consent to lay investiture,<ref name=\"Kleinhenz, pg. 492\"/> and the excommunication had been published in Rome, but the pope was compelled to flee from the city.

On October 24, 1119, the Pope and Emperor again negotiated a settlement in the investiture dispute in [[Mouzon, Ardennes|Mouzon]] on the [[Meuse]]. Henry only wished to make extensive commitments with the consent of the princes. The negotiations failed. The encounter at [[Reims]] in October 1119 is considered the ''\"end and turning point of royal penance in Medieval Europe\"''. During the negotiations on the solution of the ban, Henry V found it ''hard, even unbearable'' to submit to a reconciliation ritual and meet the Pope bare-footed. After his father's [[Road to Canossa|walk to Canossa]] in 1077, the ideas of penitence and the personal exposure within one's social status could no longer be reconciled by another papal ban, as the intrinsic meanings symbolized subordination to the Pope. It is, however not certain whether the negotiations failed due to those circumstances. Only upon the conclusion of the [[Concordat of Worms|Worms Concordat]] in 1122 was Henry re-admitted without penance or submission to the ecclesial community by a papal legate. After the negotiations had failed, Pope Calixt conferred the honor of papal legacy to the Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, and thus strengthened the opposition to Henry.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/><ref name=gru>{{cite web |url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fmst.2001.35.issue-1/9783110242331.61/9783110242331.61.xml |title= Inszenierung verpflichtet Zum Verst\u00e4ndnis ritueller Akte bei Papst-Kaiser-Begegnungen im 12.

The Archbishop mobilized large contingents, largely from Saxony, for the defense of Mainz. As the two armies faced each other near the city, the commanding princes of both sides began negotiations and in autumn 1121 urged the emperor to make peace and seek balanced policies with regards to the Pope. This princely action was an important developmental step towards the establishment of consensual forms of rule as the princes acted cooperatively to bring about negotiations that end the conflict. A princely peace commission composed of equal numbers was appointed. Made up of twelve supporters and twelfe opponents of Henry, the committee intended to represent all imperial estaes. The princely assembly, that chronicler [[Ekkehard of Aura]] called a gathering of ''many \"heads of the state\" (tot capita rei publicae)'' met on September 29, 1121 in W\u00fcrzburg and forced the emperor to finally reconcile with the pope.<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 181\"/><ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nThus, on September 23, 1122 the so-called Concordat of Worms came about. Calixt II, was represented by Cardinal [[Lambert, Bishop of Ostia]]. The particular clauses of the Concordat were negotiated among the princes. The mutual exchange of two documents, an imperial (''Heinricianum'') and a papal (''Calixtinum'') paper marked the official settlement of the ''investiture dispute'' between pope and emperor. Upon future bishop ordinations, a distinction was to be made between the ''temporalities'' (secular property and prerogatives) and the ''spiritualities'' (spiritual authority). The [[Consecration|episcopal ordination]] was to be performed by ''\"the clergy and the people\"''. The ''Heinricianum'', explicitly classified as a political work of the princes ruled that Henry was to end the practice of investment with ring and staff. The king was to restore all church property, is no longer the sole representant of the empire and rules henceforth in sync with the princes.<ref>Bryce, pg. 164</ref> The ''Calixtinum'' allowes the emperor to be present at the ordination of bishops and abbots. Henry is only allowed to grant the [[Imperial Regalia|royal regalia]] to the newly elected with his scepter. The final consecration was to be performed by the [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|Metropolitan]] for bishops and by the bishops for the abbots. Henry, who had been solemnly excommunicated at [[Reims]] by Calixt in October 1119,<ref>Comyn, pg. 182</ref> abandoned his former papal nominee, Gregory VIII and is again received into the community of the Roman church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fmst.2003.37.issue-1/9783110179149.141/9783110179149.141.xml |title= F\u00fcrstliche Opposition gegen das K\u00f6nigtum im 11. und 12.

[[Henry I of England]] asked his son-in-law for military support in his struggle for dominance in [[Normandy]]. Like [[Louis VI of France]], Henry V had vague designs on the [[Low Countries]] and an invasion in Northern France would enable him to strengthen his position in [[Flanders]]. In August 1124 Henry V began preparations for a campaign into France  among very low ducal support. The attack spurred a hitherto unknown patriotic feeling of unity in France, which the French King Louis VI utilized for the deployment of a massive army against which Henry V's forces represented not match. The campaign was abandoned near [[Metz]] and Henry returned home.<ref name=\"Cambridge Medieval History Volume V p604\">''The Cambridge Medieval History'' Volume V, p604</ref>\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:Grab Heinrich V. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|Henry V's tomb, Cathedral of Speyer]]\nDuring his last years the emperor's was occupied with a campaign in [[Flanders]] and the succession of the [[margraviate of Meissen]], two disputes in which his opponents were aided by [[Lothair of Saxony]].<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 183\">Comyn, pg. 183</ref> On 23 May 1125, Henry died of cancer in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 183\"/> at the age of 39. His bones are buried at [[Speyer]], his heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]]. On his deathbed, he entrusted the care of his wife Mathilde and having no legitimate children he left his possessions to his sororal nephew, Frederick II of Hohenstaufen.<ref>Comyn, pg. 184</ref> Upon his death the dynastic line of the Franconian, Salian emperors went extinct.\n\nSpeyer's importance as the Salic memorial site soon declined and it took several generations until it became a royal burial site again. The emperor's long tenure of excommunication was probably the reason that only Gladbach, a reform monastery under Siegburg domain and the Niederaltaich Imperial Abbey, are the only monasteries that have adopted Henry V's memorial service.\n\nMatilda handed the imperial insignia to the Archbishop of Mainz and in September 1126 she returned to England. The Hohenstaufer Duke Friedrich II had been considered a promising candidate for royal succession due to his kinship with Heinrich V and his involvement in the efforts towards imperial unification. However, his candidacy at the Mainz electoral assembly on August 24, 1125 was unsuccessful since he refused to accept free elections (''libera electio'') of the princes and he further destroyed his chances due to his overconfidence of victory, which was generally perceived as haughty (''ambicone cecatus''). Further royal candidates were [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria]], [[Charles I, Count of Flanders]] and the Saxon Duke [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]], who was eventually elected. Legitimacy was no longer determined by inheritance, but through election by the imperial princes.<ref name=fidi/><ref name=\"(of-?)1842\">{{cite book|author=Eduard Gervais (of-?)|title=Kaiser Lothar III.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnkRAAAAYAAJ|year=1842|publisher=F.A.

The arrest of an elder was no longer regarded as a commendable act of the disempowerment of a schismatic ruler, but viewed under the aspect of betrayal of the biological father. Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz characterized the immediate reign of Henry V as ''\"oppression\" of \"church and empire\"'' and the upcoming ''\"election\" should bring \"freedom\" to the church and \"peace\" to the people''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/31804476/Die_Salier._Macht_im_Wandel |title= Die Salier.

For the French abbot [[Suger]] of Saint-Denis, Henry was a troublemaker, who died justly within a year of his attack on France in 1124. For Suger, national standards did not matter, but the souvereign's attitude towards the pope constituted the decisive component for his judgment. For Geoffrey of Vend\u00f4me Henry was the incarnation of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] and [[Richard of Poitiers|Richard of Cluny]] asserted that his childlessness was the just punishment for the betrayal of his father. For [[H\u00e9riman of Tournai]], Henry was guilty of ''planned  betrayal and treachery in Rome'' ''(\"proditio et perfidia diu premeditata\")'', who ''behaved like a tyrant''. The 1111 events in Rome were discussed throughout all Latin Christianity. The French annals often only mention the imprisonment of the pope by Henry. The events of 1111 also echoed into the far west of Europe. The [[Brittany|Breton]] ''Chronicon Kemperlegiense'' of the [[Quimper Cathedral|Quimperl\u00e9 monastery]] mentioned an \"Emperor\" for the very first time among its record on the capture of the pope: ''\"Emperor Henry came to Rome, captured Paschal by treason and forced him to take an oath\"''.<ref name=\"Borgolte2009\"/><ref name=\"Sieber-Lehmann2015\">{{cite book|author=Claudius Sieber-Lehmann|title=Papst und Kaiser als Zwillinge?: Ein anderer Blick auf die Universalgewalten im Investiturstreit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCRsDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA188|date=16 September 2015|publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag K\u00f6ln Weimar|isbn=978-3-412-22450-9|pages=188\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

He was made co-ruler by his father, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], in 1098.\n\nIn Emperor Henry IV's conflicts with the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] and the [[Investiture Controversy|struggle]] against the reform papacy, young Henry V allied himself with the opponents of his father. He forced Henry IV to abdicate on 31 December 1105 and ruled for five years in compliance with the imperial princes. He tried, unsuccessfully, to withdraw the [[regalia]] from the bishops and in order to at least preserve the previous right to invest he captured [[Pope Paschal II]] and forced him to perform his imperial coronation in 1111. Once crowned emperor, Henry departed from joint rule with the princes and resorted to earlier Salian autocratic rule. After he had failed to increase control over the church, the princes in Saxony and on the Middle and Lower Rhine, in 1121 the imperial princes forced Henry V to consent with the papacy. He surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers, and in 1122 he and [[Pope Callixtus II]] ended the Investiture Controversy in the [[Concordat of Worms]].\n\n==Life==\n===Imperial crisis===\n\nHenry V was probably born on August 11th in 1081 or 1086.{{efn|Richard Gaettens suggests the year 1086: The birth year of Heinrich V. 1081 or 1086?

This ceremony usually took place at the age of 15.<ref name=\"Kleinhenz2004\"/>\n\nThree children of Henry IV and his wife [[Bertha of Savoy]] (died in 1087), Henry and his two older siblings, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] and [[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], survived childhood; two other siblings had died early. Henry seems to have spent the first years of his life primarily in [[Regensburg]]. His mentor was [[Conrad (bishop of Utrecht)|Conrad]] Bishop of Utrecht.<ref name=\"Weinfurter2006\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Canossa: die Entzauberung der Welt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Njz-yD1wkkC|year=2006|publisher=C.H.Beck|isbn=978-3-406-53590-1}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of Henry's birth, his father, emperor Henry IV, had already been engaged in many years of drawn out conflicts with the pope, the imperial bishops, and secular princes for the preservation of his rule. Henry IV had never paid much attention to the advice, or the rights and privileges of the landed nobility.<ref name=unhe/> [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], as the centre of resistance, was joined by the southern duchies of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. These southern duchies again sought the support of [[Pope Gregory VII]], the chief advocate of church reform ideas. Gregory's central demand was that the emperor must refrain from investing abbots and bishops, a practice that had been essential for the [[Imperial Church System]] since Emperor [[Otto I]]. Gregory VII [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] Henry IV in 1077. By [[Road to Canossa|repenting at Canossa]], Henry managed to get absolved. In 1080 and 1094, however, Henry IV was excommunicated again. In 1102, the church ban was again declared over him and his party, including his son, Henry V. The conflict divided the empire from the church.<ref name=\"Weinfurter2006\"/>\n\nHenry IV therefore sought to strengthen his influence in the south. His daughter, Agnes, was engaged to [[Frederick I, Duke of Swabia|Friedrich]], who in 1079 obtained the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. The emperor also sought to secure his royal succession. Henry IV chose his eldest son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]], to be his heir and arranged to have Conrad crowned king in Aachen in 1087. After Conrad defected to the ''Church Reform Party'' in Italy in 1093, his royalty and inheritance were revoked at a court in Mainz and transferred to his younger brother, Henry V, in May 1098. The latter had to take an oath never to rule over the father. On January 6, 1099, Henry V was crowned king in [[Aachen]], where he was required to repeat the oath. His brother, Conrad, died in [[Florence]] on July 27, 1101. The continued existence of the Salian dynasty now depended on Henry V, the only living son of the emperor. The co-regency of son and father proceeded without obvious problems for six years. Contrary to previous ruling sons, Henry V was not involved in government affairs. His father's policies proceeded to be extremely cautious after the death of his older son, Conrad.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\">{{cite book|author1=Bernd Schneidm\u00fcller|author2=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Die deutschen Herrscher des Mittelalters: historische Portraits von Heinrich I. bis Maximilian I.

Stefan Weinfurter argues that religious reform motives and the corrosive influence of a group of young Bavarian counts - [[Diepold III, Margrave of Vohburg|Margrave Diepold III von Vohburg]], Count [[Berengar II of Sulzbach]] and Count Otto von Habsburg-Kastl - are the primary causes. These nobles succeeded in convincing the young Henry V of his father's lost cause and the eventual triumph of reform. If he did not act and waited until his father died, someone else would attempt to ascend the throne and would find many supporters. Out of concern for his salvation, Henry then abandoned his father and joined the \"salvation community\" of the young Bavarians.<ref name=rege>{{cite web |url=http://www.regesta-imperii.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Regesta_Imperii_Beiheft_34.pdf |title= Heinrich V. in seiner Zeit |publisher= Regesta  | date=   | author=Gerhard Lubich  | accessdate= February 3, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAnother line of research supports the theory that the murder of Sieghard of Burghausen in February 1104 by [[Ministerialis|ministerials]] and citizens of Regensburg was the trigger for the overthrow of Henry IV. According to Burghausen's relatives and other nobles, the emperor had failed to punish the perpetrators appropriately, proving that Henry IV viewed aristocrats with disdain. Henry V had attempted in vain to mediate an amicable settlement between Burghausen and the ministerials in the dispute that led to the murder, and he also would have had a reason to resent his father's inaction. A flaw in this theory is that there was a very long time lag between the murder of Burghausen and when Henry V turned his back on his father.<ref name=rege/><ref name=\"St\u00fcrner2019\">{{cite book|author=Wolfgang St\u00fcrner|title=Die Staufer: Eine mittelalterliche Herrscherdynastie - Bd. 1: Aufstieg und Machtentfaltung (975 bis 1190)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5y6DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT446|date=30 October 2019|publisher=[[Kohlhammer Verlag]]|isbn=978-3-17-035365-7|pages=446\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1104, Henry V had joined his father's army on a punitive expedition against Saxon Reformers who had opposed the election of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Archbishop of Magdeburg]]. On December 12, 1104, Henry V broke away from his father, thereby breaking the oath of allegiance to the ruling king. Henry V made his way to Regensburg, where he celebrated Christmas with his followers. While there, his father's enemies sought to convince him to revolt. Henry considered their arguments, but he was restrained by the oath he had taken to take no part in the business of the Empire during his father's lifetime. At the turn of the year 1104/05, he sent messengers to Rome to seek absolution from his loyalty oath by [[Pope Paschal&nbsp;II]],<ref name=\"Kleinhenz, pg. 492\"/> The Pope promised Henry V, on condition that Henry be a righteous king and a promoter of the Church, not only absolution from the sin of breaking this oath, but also support in the struggle against his father.<ref name=unhe>{{cite web |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/vuf/article/view/17900/11708 |title= Noch einmal zu den Vorw\u00fcrfen gegen Heinrich IV.

Henry V began to strengthen his ties with Saxony, where the opposition against his father was particularly strong due in part to his absence from the duchy since 1089. In the spring of 1105, Henry V stayed in Saxony for two months and showed his willingness to work with the church on the basis of ''Gregorian'' ideas by removing the bishops, Friedrich von Halberstadt, Udo von Hildesheim, and Henry von Paderborn, who had been appointed by his father. In [[Quedlinburg]], he entered the town barefoot on Palm Sunday, thus demonstrating his humility (''humilitas''), an elementary Christian virtue of rulers. His stay concluded with the celebration of the Pentecost festival in [[Merseburg]] and the confirmation of the Magdeburg [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]].<ref name=unhe/><ref>Holland, A.

By the end of October 1105, Henry V arrived at [[Speyer]], the centre of Salian rule. There, he installed Gebhard, a fervent opponent of his father, as [[Bishop of Speyer|Bishop]]. In the fall of 1105, the armies of father and son faced each other at the [[Regen (river)|Regen]] river. However, a battle was prevented by the princes of both sides who wished to find a peaceful solution. At Christmas 1105, an agreement was to be reached at a [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|diet]] in Mainz.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\">{{cite book|author=I. S.

On December 23 in [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], Henry persuaded his father to retreat to a castle for his own protection, as Archbishop [[Ruthard of Mainz]] would refuse to let him into the city. Henry agreed and was lead to [[Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim|B\u00f6ckelheim Castle]], the property of Bishop Gebhard, not for his protection, but for custody. Henry was thrown into the dungeon and was held there ''\"unwashed and unshaven and deprived of any service\"'' over Christmas. At the Reichstag in Mainz, Henry prompted his father to hand over the [[Imperial Regalia|imperial insignia]] (crown, scepter, imperial cross, holy lance and imperial sword). Henry IV then was transferred to [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|Ingelheim]] where he personally was to hand over the imperial insignia and was forced to abdicate on December 31, 1105. Henry V subsequently spread the narrative in which his father had the insignia and his rule voluntarily ceded to him.

The papal party who had supported Henry in his resistance to his father hoped he would endorse the papal decrees, which had been renewed by [[Paschal&nbsp;II]] at the synod of [[Guastalla]] in&nbsp;1106. The king, however, continued to invest the bishops, but wished the pope to hold a council in Germany to settle the question.

Welf's presence was particularly important for Henry as he had been married to [[Matilda of Tuscany]] from 1089 to 1095, which entitled him to inheritance claims on her vast property.

Matilda,  who in 1079 had indeed intended to bequeath all her property to the pope in the event of her childlessness, now opted for an agreement between the pope and the king, and deployed the name '''''Henry'''''.

Pope Paschal proposed that Henry give up the investiture altogether - the appointment of bishops to the episcopate - and in return get back all fiefs of sovereign royal [[regalia]] in the duchies and margraviates and the coin - market - and customs rights. Henry and Pope Paschal agreed on this idea in a preliminary contract on February 4, 1111. The bishops were thus deprived of rights and income that had been theirs since the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian era]], with which their service to the king was traditionally made possible and rewarded.<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 177\"/> If these regalia were returned to the empire, the bishops could only live off their own property, the [[tithe]] and alms, limit them to their ministry, that increased their dependence on the Pope. They would have lost all political rights and responsibilities in the empire and be dependent on secular protection. On February 9, Henry V  accepted the papal ''Concordat of Sutri''.

Protests broke out, there was turmoil in the city itself and the coronation had to be cancelled. Henry demanded his investment rights to be reinstated and the immediate coronation. Paschal refused, and Henry seized and imprisoned him in St. Peter. After two months Henry was able to acquire his father's (Henry IV) absolution from Paschal in the ''Treaty of Ponte Mammolo'' on April 12, and the right to invest with ring and staff. On April 13, Paschal completed the imperial coronation. In addition, Paschal had to swear an oath never to excommunicate Henry.<ref name=\"Robinson1990\"/><ref>Bryce, pg. 306</ref>\n\nUpon the Pope's imprisonment, however, Henry lost widespread acknowledgment as he had apprehended Christ's representative, the highest authority in the Latin Christian world. In response, he was banned by cardinal and [[Papal legate|legate]] [[Cuno of Praeneste]] at a synod in Jerusalem in the summer of 1111. In September 1112 he was excommunicated by a Burgundian synod headed by Archbishop Guido of Vienne, the future [[Pope Calixtus II]]. According to scholar Stefan Weinfurter, the year 1111 was a turning point in the reign of Henry V. The recent unity between the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform Church]] and the king broke and with it the ties of consensual rule between the king and the secular princes. In March 1112, the Investiture privilege was revoked by the curia on a [[Lateran council]] and designated as ''depraved privilege'' (''Pravilege'').<ref name=\"Zey2017\">{{cite book|author=Claudia Zey|title=Der Investiturstreit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAHuDQAAQBAJ|date=23 February 2017|publisher=C.H.Beck|isbn=978-3-406-70656-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Hartmann2010\"/><ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\n<!--At [[Sutri]] he concluded an arrangement with Paschal by which he renounced the rite of investiture in return for a promise of coronation and the restoration to the Empire of all Christendom, which had been in the hands of the German state and church since the time of [[Charlemagne]].<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 177\"/> It was a treaty impossible to execute, and Henry, whose consent to it is said to have been conditional on its acceptance by the princes and bishops of Germany, probably foresaw that it would occasion a breach between the German clergy and the pope.\n\nHaving entered Rome and sworn the usual oaths, the king presented himself at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on 12 February 1111 for his coronation and the ratification of the treaty.

On his return from Italy he was a guest of Matilda of Tuscany at Bianello Castle from May 6th to 8th 1111. Matilda and Henry concluded a contract that researchers interpreted as Henry V's document of inheritance in case the margravine dies. On August 7, 1111, Henry was able to finally bring about his father's funeral, who had so far rested in an unconsecrated side chapel of Speyer Cathedral. On the same day and seven days later, on August 14 (a date of significance for the [[liturgy|liturgical]] commemoration of the dead) Henry granted two privileges, which endowed the citizens of Speyer with yet unprecedented civil liberties. As the first privilege lays out memorial ceremonies the privileges for the citizens of the city of Speyer are considered a ''milestone'' in the history of the emergence of civil liberties. The residents were granted numerous rights and benefits (including exemption from inheritance taxes, court taxes and property taxes). No other city in the empire was granted such extensive and far-reaching liberties at the beginning of the 12th century. These privileges highlight the changes in the Salian idea of kingship compared to the first three Salian rulers. Donations no longer applied to the clergy alone, but an entire township was committed to the Salian [[Memorialization]]. The Speyer civil liberties, legal privileges and economic advance were associated with the memory of Henry V.<ref name=and>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269625342_Burgerrecht_Die_Speyrer_Privilegien_von_1111_und_die_Anfange_personlicher_Freiheitsrechte_in_deutschen_Stadten_des_hohen_Mittelalters |title= B\u00fcrgerrecht.

At the funeral, he had presented himself as the loyal son and legitimate heir of the late emperor and demonstrated dynastic continuity. At the same time, he made it clear that his kingship was based not only on his successful rebellion against the father and the approval of the princes, but also on his inheritance claim to the throne. The city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] was also granted generous privileges in 1114, however, unlike in Speyer, the residents were not granted any personal freedoms.<ref>Comyn, pg. 180</ref><ref name=and/>\n\n===Breach of the consensual order and war with Cologne===\n\n[[File:Trifels - aus der Hubschrauberperspektive.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Trifels Castle]] near the modern small town of [[Annweiler am Trifels|Annweiler]].

Shepherd]], 1923]]\nBeginning in 1111, Henry increasingly bypassed the princely consensus for his actions and hardly received any approval. He even applied his father's autocratic forms of government, thus exacerbating the conflict. After the events of 1111, numerous clergymen fell away from him, including first Archbishop [[Conrad I of Salzburg]], Bishop [[Reinhard of Blankenburg|Reinhard of Halberstadt]] and most significant the break with his long-time confidant [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert of Saarbr\u00fccken]], imperial chancellor since February 14, 1106, who had greatly influenced imperial politics. Adalbert was appointed Archbishop of Mainz in 1109 and accompanied Henry on the Italian campaign of 1110/11. In the process of the consolidation and expansion of power, the possessions of the Mainz Church overlapped with the Salian imperial estate at the [[Middle Rhine]]. The conflict with Adalbert apparently arose over [[Trifels Castle]]. Without gaining the consensus of the princes, Henry arrested and detained Adalbert for over three years. Among threats of violence and dissent the Mainz citizens only succeed in November 1115 the archbishop (starved to skin and bones) to be released. The customs of amicable conflict resolution and demonstrative gentleness that had been handed down from the Ottonian era had lost importance under Henry IV and Henry V. Rather, the Salian rulers sought to establish a concrete form of royal punishment. Adalbert became the great opponent of the Salian kingship.<ref name=wei175/>\n\nProperty disputes also led to conflicts in Saxony, as Henry interfered with the princely territorial policy while trying to expand the Salian domain. In 1112, [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]], [[Duke of Saxony]], rebelled against Henry but was quickly subdued. In 1113, after the death of the childless Count Ulrich Margrave of Carniola, numerous Saxon nobles laid claims to this estate. However, Henry had obviously decided that the bequest would fall to the empire if there were no direct heirs. The king's idea nonetheless contradicted the Saxon legal concept and Henry obtained the endowment through approval of the royal princes but he completely avoided any dialogue with the Saxon nobles. Lothair, who rose in arms again was defeated at the ''Battle of Warnstadt'',<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 181\">Comyn, pg. 181</ref> though was later pardoned.<ref name=dend/>\n\nArchbishop [[Frederick I (archbishop of Cologne)|Frederick of Cologne]] also broke with Henry during a campaign against the [[Frisians]], who refused to pay the annual tribute and Henry allegedly sacrificed a Cologne troop contingent to the Frisians. The citizens of Cologne complained about the draconian regiment of one of Henry's [[ministerials]] and Archbishop Friedrich denounced the catastrophic condition of the church in a letter. The episcopal seats of Worms and Mainz remained vacant for years and the secular rights of the bishops were carried out by royal administrators (''villici''). The territorial princes complained as well. From 1113 Henry had begun to adopt the Salian ''practice of occupation'', when for the first time, Burchhard, a [[court chaplain]] was installed as governor of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Diocese of Cambrai]] during the same year. The appointment of Bruning as [[Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim|Bishop of Hildesheim]] and Gerhard as [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Bishop of Merseburg]] also failed to achieve consent with the Saxon nobility.<ref name=mart/><ref>Henderson, Ernest, ''A History of Germany in the Middle Ages'', (Haskell House, 1894), pg. 222</ref>\n\nThe insurgents united behind the Archbishop of Cologne and collectively fell from the emperor in early 1114. Two imperial campaigns against the dissidents failed. Initially, Henry took the fortified town of Deutz, which lay across the Rhine from Cologne. His control of Deutz allowed him to cut Cologne off from all river trade and transportation. At this point, the citizens of Cologne assembled a large force, including bowmen, and crossed the river, formed their ranks, and prepared to meet Henry's army.<ref name=\"rob\"/>  The Cologne bowmen were able to break the armor of Henry's soldiers; it was summer, the weather was sultry, and the soldiers had removed their armor to find relief from the heat. Henry subsequently withdrew, turned south, and sacked Bonn and J\u00fclich. On his return to Deutz, he was met by [[Frederick I (Archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Frederick]], Duke Gottfried of Lorraine,{{clarify|doesn't seem to be equivalent Godfrey (English spelling) after Godfrey IV or V|date=December 2013}} Henry of Zutphen, and Count Theodoric of Aar,{{clarify|Can't find \"Aar\" anyplace except as a river.

After an initial skirmish in which Duke Henry of Lorraine was forced to withdraw, the insurgent's troops and the emperor's force of Swabians, Bavarians, and Franconians clashed. The young men of Cologne, including many journeymen and apprentices, created a fearful din of noise, slashing at all who came near them. Theodric threw his force into the fight, and the emperor's army was forced back.<ref name=\"rob\"/> The defeat at [[Andernach]] ended Henry's presence at the Lower Rhine.\n\nAt Christmas 1114, unrest culminated in Saxony. On February 11, 1115, Duke Lothair eventually defeated Henry in the [[Battle of Welfesholz]], that ended Salian rule in Saxony.<ref>Bisson, Thomas M., ''The Crisis of the Twelfth Century'' (Princeton University Press, 2009), pg. 215</ref> From then on Lothair maintained a near royal rule in Saxony, while Henry's power to uphold universal kingship decreased further. The lack of acceptance and loss of prestige reflected itself at the court as none of the princes attended the ''Hoftag'' on November 1, 1115 in Mainz. Scheduled ''court day''s had to be cancelled in advance due to the lack of confirmed participants. Henry celebrated Christmas of 1115, one of the most essential occasions of royal representation, in Speyer, surrounded by only a few faithful adherents among whom [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Frederick II of Swabia]] gained increasing significance. Simultaneously, Henry's opponents gathered in Cologne upon the invitation of Adalbert of Mainz, to discuss clerical issues.<ref name=zz>{{cite web|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/16897/2/Zoelch.pdf |title=  Die Bisch\u00f6fe von Speyerzur Zeit Kaiser Friedrichs II.| publisher =  Uni Heidelberg  |date=   |author=Karl-Albert Z\u00f6lch  |accessdate= February 10, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=jut/>\n\nThe 1111 events in Rome and the 1115 defeat at the hands of the Saxon opposition led to  the near complete dissolution of all ties between the bishops and the king.

(Chronicle of [[Ekkehard of Aura]], [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]])]]\nFrom 1108 on Henry V made official proposals for a marriage with a princess of the English royal family, seeking to increase the authority of the Salian king and secure his throne. His engagement with the eight-year-old princess [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] took place in Utrecht at Easter of 1110. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] King [[Henry I of England]] paid the extraordinarily high sum of 10,000 or 15,000 pounds of silver as [[dowry]]. In return, his daughter's marriage to Henry V. enormously increased his prestige. On July 25, 1110 Matilda was crowned [[List of German queens|Roman-German Queen]] in Mainz by the Archbishop of Cologne. Four years later the wedding celebrations also took  place in Mainz on January 7, 1114 amid great splendor and the attention of princes from all over the empire. The Salians appropriated the occasion to reaffirm unanimity with the imperial nobles after the conflicts in recent years. Duke Lothair of Supplinburg appeared barefoot and in [[penance|penitent]] clothing at the wedding. He was forgiven for his participation in the inheritance disputes of [[Carniola]] after performing a ''Deditio'' (''submission''). This occasion is the only known case of a ''Deditio'' during Henry V's reign, which historians have compared to the amicable set of rules and conflict management and settlement of the [[Ottonian dynasty]]. On the other hand, Henry had count [[Louis the Springer|Louis of Thuringia]] captured and imprisoned for his participation in the Saxon rebellion, ''which upset many princes''. Henry's impertinent demonstrations of power, greatly diminished the overall atmosphere of the festivity. Some princes left the festival without permission, as others used the opportunity for conspiracies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hist.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:33bf7448-9d88-4b34-8201-90fb17f1ef02/2011_Zey_Mathilde_von_England.pdf |title=  Die Kaiserinnen des Mittelalters | publisher =  Uni Z\u00fcrich |date=   |author=AmalieF\u00f6ssel  |accessdate= February 10, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Borgolte2009\">{{cite book|author=Michael Borgolte|title=Das europ\u00e4ische Mittelalter im Spannungsbogen des Vergleichs: Zwanzig internationale Beitr\u00e4ge zu Praxis, Problemen und Perspektiven der historischen Komparatistik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qatHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT328|date=16 December 2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-05-004829-1|pages=328\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Houts2019\">{{cite book|author=Elisabeth van Houts|title=Married Life in the Middle Ages, 900-1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|date=31 January 2019|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-251974-0|pages=296\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe marriage to Matilda produced no male heirs.

In addition, he wished to stabilize Salian rule in Northern Italy and create a new power base against the overpowering opposition in the northern part of the empire. He had issued a whole series of court documents in advance, with which he intended to present himself as guarantor of law and justice in Italy. Henry was able to obtain Matildas property without any problems and his authority was accepted in all the Italian municipalities. Henry regarded Rome as to be of particular importance and, ardently welcomed, he honored the city with five visits, more than any other Salian king.<ref name=\"K\u00fcss2013\">{{cite book|author=Tobias K\u00fcss|title=Die \u00e4lteren Diepoldinger als Markgrafen in Bayern (1077\u20131204): Adlige Herrschaftsbildung im Hochmittelalter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUkjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA398|date=4 October 2013|publisher=Herbert Utz Verlag|isbn=978-3-8316-4261-8|pages=398\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"St\u00fcrner2019\"/>\n\nPope Paschal died on January 21, 1118.

After a banishment of Henry by papal legates around [[Jordan, Archbishop of Milan]] had only limited effects, Gelasius II himself banished the emperor. For a forthcoming ''Hoftag'' in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] and during Henry's absence the royal princes planned the restoration of ''Imperial Peace'' and the deposition of the king in the event of his prolonged absence. Henry abruptly broke off the Italian campaign in the fall of 1118 and returned to the north. His wife Matilda remained in Italy as deputy ruler. Henry was able to prevent the ''court day'' in W\u00fcrzburg. However, his subsequent activities until September/October 1119 can't be determined due to the lack of sources. The feeble compliance with his reign is obvious by the lack of royal documents and the nearly unknown [[itinerarium]] of Henry's court, since apparently nobody ever requested any of these documents.<ref name=fidi>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/14141219/Fidi_milites_Die_Staufer_und_Kaiser_Heinrich_V |title=  Fidi milites?

But [[Jordan, Archbishop of Milan]], excommunicated him at San Tecla. He took possession of Matilda's lands and was gladly received in Rome. By this time Paschal had withdrawn his consent to lay investiture,<ref name=\"Kleinhenz, pg. 492\"/> and the excommunication had been published in Rome, but the pope was compelled to flee from the city.

On October 24, 1119, the Pope and Emperor again negotiated a settlement in the investiture dispute in [[Mouzon, Ardennes|Mouzon]] on the [[Meuse]]. Henry only wished to make extensive commitments with the consent of the princes. The negotiations failed. The encounter at [[Reims]] in October 1119 is considered the ''\"end and turning point of royal penance in Medieval Europe\"''. During the negotiations on the solution of the ban, Henry V found it ''hard, even unbearable'' to submit to a reconciliation ritual and meet the Pope bare-footed. After his father's [[Road to Canossa|walk to Canossa]] in 1077, the ideas of penitence and the personal exposure within one's social status could no longer be reconciled by another papal ban, as the intrinsic meanings symbolized subordination to the Pope. It is, however not certain whether the negotiations failed due to those circumstances. Only upon the conclusion of the [[Concordat of Worms|Worms Concordat]] in 1122 was Henry re-admitted without penance or submission to the ecclesial community by a papal legate. After the negotiations had failed, Pope Calixt conferred the honor of papal legacy to the Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, and thus strengthend the opposition to Henry.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/><ref name=gru>{{cite web |url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fmst.2001.35.issue-1/9783110242331.61/9783110242331.61.xml |title= Inszenierung verpflichtet Zum Verst\u00e4ndnis ritueller Akte bei Papst-Kaiser-Begegnungen im 12.

The Archbishop mobilized large contingents, largely from Saxony, for the defense of Mainz. As the two armies faced each other near the city, the commanding princes of both sides began negotiations and in autumn 1121 urged the emperor to make peace and seek balanced policies with regards to the Pope. This princely action was an important developmental step towards the establishment of consensual forms of rule as the princes acted cooperatively to bring about negotiations that end the conflict. A princely peace commission composed of equal numbers was appointed. Made up of twelve supporters and twelfe opponents of Henry, the committee intended to represent all imperial estaes. The princely assembly, that chronicler [[Ekkehard of Aura]] called a gathering of ''many \"heads of the state\" (tot capita rei publicae)'' met on September 29, 1121 in W\u00fcrzburg and forced the emperor to finally reconcile with the pope.<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 181\"/><ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nThus, on September 23, 1122 the so-called Concordat of Worms came about. Calixt II, was represented by Cardinal [[Lambert, Bishop of Ostia]]. The particular clauses of the Concordat were negotiated among the princes. The mutual exchange of two documents, an imperial (''Heinricianum'') and a papal (''Calixtinum'') paper marked the official settlement of the ''investiture dispute'' between pope and emperor. Upon future bishop ordinations, a distinction was to be made between the ''temporalities'' (secular property and prerogatives) and the ''spiritualities'' (spiritual authority). The [[Consecration|episcopal ordination]] was to be performed by ''\"the clergy and the people\"''. The ''Heinricianum'', explicitly classified as a political work of the princes ruled that Henry was to end the practice of investment with ring and staff. The king was to restore all church property, is no longer the sole representant of the empire and rules henceforth in sync with the princes.<ref>Bryce, pg. 164</ref> The ''Calixtinum'' allowes the emperor to be present at the ordination of bishops and abbots. Henry is only allowed to grant the [[Imperial Regalia|royal regalia]] to the newly elected with his scepter. The final consecration was to be performed by the [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|Metropolitan]] for bishops and by the bishops for the abbots. Henry, who had been solemnly excommunicated at [[Reims]] by Calixt in October 1119,<ref>Comyn, pg. 182</ref> abandoned his former papal nominee, Gregory VIII and is again received into the community of the Roman church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fmst.2003.37.issue-1/9783110179149.141/9783110179149.141.xml |title= F\u00fcrstliche Opposition gegen das K\u00f6nigtum im 11. und 12.

[[Henry I of England]] asked his son-in-law for military support in his struggle for dominance in [[Normandy]]. Like [[Louis VI of France]], Henry V had vague designs on the [[Low Countries]] and an invasion in Northern France would enable him to strengthen his position in [[Flanders]]. In August 1124 Henry V began preparations for a campaign into France  among very low ducal support. The attack spurred a hitherto unknown patriotic feeling of unity in France, which the French King Louis VI utilized for the deployment of a massive army against which Henry V's forces represented not match. The campaign was abandoned near [[Metz]] and Henry returned home.<ref name=\"Cambridge Medieval History Volume V p604\">''The Cambridge Medieval History'' Volume V, p604</ref>\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:Grab Heinrich V. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|Henry V's tomb, Cathedral of Speyer]]\nDuring his last years the emperor's was occupied with a campaign in [[Flanders]] and the succession of the [[margraviate of Meissen]], two disputes in which his opponents were aided by [[Lothair of Saxony]].<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 183\">Comyn, pg. 183</ref> On 23 May 1125, Henry died of cancer in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 183\"/> at the age of 39.

On his deathbed, he entrusted the care of his wife Mathilde and having no legitimate children he left his possessions to his sororal nephew, Frederick II of Hohenstaufen.<ref>Comyn, pg. 184</ref> Upon his death the dynastic line of the Franconian, Salian emperors went extinct.\n\nSpeyer's importance as the Salic memorial site soon declined and it took several generations until it became a royal burial site again. The emperor's long tenure of excommunication was probably the reason that only Gladbach, a reform monastery under Siegburg domain and the Niederaltaich Imperial Abbey, are the only monasteries that have adopted Henry V's memorial service.\n\nMatilda handed the imperial insignia to the Archbishop of Mainz and in September 1126 she returned to England. The Hohenstaufer Duke Friedrich II had been considered a promising candidate for royal succession due to his kinship with Heinrich V and his involvement in the efforts towards imperial unification. However, his candidacy at the Mainz electoral assembly on August 24, 1125 was unsuccessful since he refused to accept free elections (''libera electio'') of the princes and he further destroyed his chances due to his overconfidence of victory, which was generally perceived as haughty (''ambicone cecatus''). Further royal candidates were [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria]], [[Charles I, Count of Flanders]] and the Saxon Duke [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]], who was eventually elected. Legitimacy was no longer determined by inheritance, but through election by the imperial princes.<ref name=fidi/><ref name=\"(of-?)1842\">{{cite book|author=Eduard Gervais (of-?)|title=Kaiser Lothar III.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnkRAAAAYAAJ|year=1842|publisher=F.A.

The arrest of an elder was no longer regarded as a commendable act of the disempowerment of a schismatic ruler, but viewed under the aspect of betrayal of the biological father. Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz characterized the immediate reign of Henry V as ''\"oppression\" of \"church and empire\"'' and the upcoming ''\"election\" should bring \"freedom\" to the church and \"peace\" to the people''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/31804476/Die_Salier._Macht_im_Wandel |title= Die Salier.

For the French abbot [[Suger]] of Saint-Denis, Henry was a troublemaker, who died justly within a year of his attack on France in 1124. For Suger, national standards did not matter, but the souvereign's attitude towards the pope constituted the decisive component for his judgment. For Geoffrey of Vend\u00f4me Henry was the incarnation of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] and [[Richard of Poitiers|Richard of Cluny]] asserted that his childlessness was the just punishment for the betrayal of his father. For [[H\u00e9riman of Tournai]], Henry was guilty of ''planned  betrayal and treachery in Rome'' ''(\"proditio et perfidia diu premeditata\")'', who ''behaved like a tyrant''. The 1111 events in Rome were discussed throughout all Latin Christianity. The French annals often only mention the imprisonment of the pope by Henry. The events of 1111 also echoed into the far west of Europe. The [[Brittany|Breton]] ''Chronicon Kemperlegiense'' of the [[Quimper Cathedral|Quimperl\u00e9 monastery]] mentioned an \"Emperor\" for the very first time among its record on the capture of the pope: ''\"Emperor Henry came to Rome, captured Paschal by treason and forced him to take an oath\"''.<ref name=\"Borgolte2009\"/><ref name=\"Sieber-Lehmann2015\">{{cite book|author=Claudius Sieber-Lehmann|title=Papst und Kaiser als Zwillinge?: Ein anderer Blick auf die Universalgewalten im Investiturstreit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCRsDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA188|date=16 September 2015|publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag K\u00f6ln Weimar|isbn=978-3-412-22450-9|pages=188\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

As the hitmen walk toward North's upstairs classroom, the teacher receives a call warning him of their arrival. Johnny sadly responds, \"It's okay. I know them.\"  As he calmly waits at his desk, Charlie and Lee enter and shoot him multiple times.\n\nAs they depart by train, Charlie is bothered that North refused to flee, and that they were paid an unusually high fee for such a simple hit. He and Lee run through what they know about the man they have just killed. Johnny was once a champion race car driver whose career ended in a violent crash. Four years before his death, he was involved in a million-dollar robbery of a mail truck. Tempted by the missing million, Charlie and Lee visit [[Miami]] to interview Johnny's former mechanic.\n\nEarl Sylvester ([[Claude Akins]]), who considers himself Johnny's only friend, is devastated to learn of his death. In between sobs and gulps of [[whiskey]], he tells the story as he remembers it. Johnny North was at the top of his profession when he met the beautiful Sheila Farr ([[Angie Dickinson]]). Johnny fell in love and planned to propose marriage after winning his next big race. However, Johnny's late nights with Sheila had left him disoriented from lack of sleep. His racing career ended with a fiery crash due a problem with a rear wheel.\n\nAt the hospital, Earl revealed to Johnny that Sheila was the [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of [[mob boss]] Jack Browning ([[Ronald Reagan]]). Known for her extravagant taste, Sheila has already cheated on Browning with several other sports figures, all of whom met bad ends. Enraged and heartbroken, Johnny rebuffed Sheila's attempts to explain and cut his ties to her.\n\nIntrigued, Charlie and Lee approach a former member of Browning's crew, who also reveals his memories. After the crash, Sheila found Johnny working as a pit mechanic. She says a much better job might soon be his for the taking. Browning was planning the robbery of a U.S. postal truck. On Sheila's recommendation, he agreed to Johnny as his [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]].\n\nAlthough Johnny still felt betrayed, Sheila said that she had always regretted losing him. Johnny forgave her. He also helped Browning by souping up the getaway car. Browning, however, was enraged when he learned that Sheila had returned to Johnny. In a deliberate provocation, Browning brutally slapped Sheila in front of Johnny, after she defied him. Johnny punched Browning and threatened to kill him if he ever hurt Sheila again. They agreed to \"settle this\" after the robbery.\n\nBrowning and North placed a phony detour sign to send the mail truck onto an isolated mountain road. When the truck stopped, the gang held it up at gunpoint, loading more than $1 million into the getaway car.  Johnny then forced Browning out of the moving car, driving off alone with the money.\n\nAfter listening to this story, Charlie and Lee pay a visit to Browning, who is now a real estate developer in [[Los Angeles]]. Browning insists he is now an honest businessman and has no idea what happened to the money. He reveals that Sheila is staying at a hotel and arranges a meeting with her.\n\nTo deprive Browning of time to plan an ambush, Charlie and Lee call at Sheila's hotel several hours earlier than agreed but unbeknownst to them a hotel clerk spots them and calls Browning. At first Sheila denies all knowledge of Johnny or the money. Charlie and Lee beat her and dangle her by the ankles out a seventh-story window. Terrified, she tells them the truth.\n\nThe night before the robbery, she told Johnny his life was in danger. Browning, she said, was planning to kill him and pocket his share. Johnny wanted to kill Browning on the spot. Sheila insisted she had a better idea. On her advice, Johnny threw Browning out of the car and drove the money to Sheila.\n\nAs the two lovers entered a motel room that Sheila had prearranged, Browning was waiting for them. Sheila asked Browning to \"do it quickly,\" and the gangster shot Johnny, severely wounding but not killing him before Johnny escaped. It turned out Sheila and Browning were husband and wife and had used Johnny as a [[fall guy]] for Browning's plan to take all of the money. Sheila expressed fear that Johnny would seek revenge, so Browning hired Charlie and Lee to murder him.\n\nCharlie now understands at last why Johnny refused to flee: the only man who refuses to run is a man who considers himself to be already dead. Sheila's betrayal had already killed Johnny long before the bullets ever touched him.\n\nCharlie and Lee, with Sheila in tow, intend to confront Browning, but he is waiting nearby with a [[sniper]] rifle. He kills Lee and wounds Charlie.\n\nBrowning and Sheila return home, where they prepare to flee with the money. A mortally wounded Charlie makes it there in time. Sheila, again revealing her disloyal nature, frantically denies any role in the ambush, insisting that her husband alone was responsible. Charlie calmly shoots Browning dead. He turns his revolver toward Sheila. When she again pleads for her life, Charlie snarls, \"Lady, I don't have the time!\" He kills Sheila with a single bullet and staggers out the door with the money. Charlie falls dead on the lawn while spilling the money out of the suitcase as a police car in the background makes its way towards the house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Charlie Strom, a professional killer\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Sheila Farr, Johnny's two-timing lover\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as Lee, a professional killer, Charlie's accomplice\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Johnny North, the man Charlie and Lee are hired to kill\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] as Jack Browning, a gangster, posing as a legitimate businessman\n* [[Claude Akins]] as Earl Sylvester, mechanic and best friend to Johnny\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mickey Farmer, gang member and associate of Browning\n* [[Virginia Christine]] as Miss Watson, the blind secretary\n* [[Don Haggerty]] as Mail Truck Driver\n* Robert Phillips as George Fleming, gang member and associate of Browning\n* [[Kathleen O'Malley]] as Miss Leslie, the receptionist\n* Ted Jacques as Gym Assistant\n* Irvin Mosley as Mail Truck Guard\n* Jimmy Joyce as Salesman\n* [[Burt Mustin]] as Elderly Man\n\n==Production==\n''The Killers'', intended to be one of the first \"[[Television movie|made-for-TV movies]],\" was filmed under the title ''Johnny North'',<ref>Smith, Cecil.
