It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] database developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"design\" /><ref name=\"about/history\" /> In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for [[SQL]]. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL.<ref name=\"Project name\" />\n\nPostgreSQL features [[Transaction processing|transactions]] with [[ACID (computer science)|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability]] (ACID) properties, automatically updatable [[View (SQL)|view]]s, [[materialized view]]s, [[Database trigger|triggers]], [[foreign key]]s, and [[stored procedure]]s.<ref name=\"intro-whatis\" /> It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to [[data warehouse]]s or [[Web services]] with many [[concurrent user]]s. It is the default database for [[macOS Server]],<ref name=\"OS X Lion Server\" /><ref name=\"MySQL not included\" /><ref name=\"OS X\" /> and is also available for [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\n\n== History ==\nPostgreSQL evolved from the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, [[Michael Stonebraker]], left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.<ref name=\"design\" /> He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the [[Turing Award]] in 2014 for these and other projects,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/stonebraker_1172121.cfm |title=Michael Stonebraker \u2013 A.M. Turing Award Winner |quote=Techniques pioneered in Postgres were widely implemented [..] Stonebraker is the only Turing award winner to have engaged in serial entrepreneurship on anything like this scale, giving him a distinctive perspective on the academic world. |website=amturing.acm.org |language=en |access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> and techniques pioneered in them.\n\nThe new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support [[data type]]s.<ref name=\"Stonebraker\" /> These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships \u2013 something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using ''rules''. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.<ref name=\"pavel-history\" />\n\nStarting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM [[SIGMOD]] Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers<ref> A Brief History of PostgreSQL [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/history.html \"Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support for multiple storage managers, an improved query executor, and a rewritten rule system.\"]. ''postgresql.org''. ''The PostgreSQL Global Development Group'', Retrieved on 18 March 2020.</ref> and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2<ref name=\"University POSTGRES\" /> on June 30, 1994 \u2013 primarily a cleanup \u2013 the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an [[MIT License]] variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced [[QUEL query languages|POSTQUEL query language]] interpreter, which could be interactively used with a [[console application]] named <kbd>''monitor''</kbd>. <!-- See http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/postgres-setup.ps -->\n\nIn 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. <kbd>''monitor''</kbd> was also replaced by <kbd>psql</kbd>. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to [[beta tester]]s on May 5, 1995.<!-- email lists are not citable, however see message 3165 of |url=http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/mail-archive/1995.05.tar.gz |title=Announcement: Postgres95 Beta |author=Andrew K.

Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.\n\nIn 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\" /> The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe project continues to make releases available under its [[free and open-source software]] PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.\n\n== Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) ==\nPostgreSQL manages [[concurrency control|concurrency]] through [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains [[ACID (computer science)|ACID]] principles. PostgreSQL offers three levels of [[isolation (database systems)|transaction isolation]]: Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full [[serializability]] via the serializable [[snapshot isolation]] (SSI) method.<ref name=\"ports\" />\n\n== Storage and replication ==\n\n=== Replication ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes ([[Write-ahead logging|write-ahead logs]] (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.\n\nPostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication<ref name=\"H Online\" /> that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.\n\nStandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.\n\nSynchronous [[multi-master replication]] is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication.<ref name=\"Postgres-XC\" /> It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called [[Postgres-XL]]. Postgres-R is yet another [[Fork (software development)|fork]].<ref name=postgres-r /> Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.<ref name=bdr />\n\nTools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.\n\nSeveral asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:\n\n* [[Slony-I]]\n* Londiste, part of SkyTools (developed by [[Skype]])\n* Bucardo multi-master replication (developed by [[Backcountry.com]])<ref name=\"Fischer\" />\n* [[SymmetricDS]] multi-master, multi-tier replication\n\n=== Indexes ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular [[B-tree]] and [[hash table]] indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees ([[GiST]]), generalized [[inverted index]]es (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST)<ref name=\"SP-GiST\" /> and [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:\n\n* [[Expression index]]es can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function, instead of simply the value of a column.\n* [[Partial index]]es, which only index part of a table, can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement. This allows a smaller index to be created.\n* The planner is able to use multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries, using temporary in-memory [[bitmap index]] operations (useful for [[data warehouse]] applications for joining a large [[fact table]] to smaller [[dimension table]]s such as those arranged in a [[star schema]]).\n* [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbors]] (''k''-NN) indexing (also referred to KNN-GiST<ref name=\"KNN-GiST\" />) provides efficient searching of \"closest values\" to that specified, useful to finding similar words, or close objects or locations with [[Geographic data and information|geospatial]] data. This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values.\n* Index-only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table.\n* PostgreSQL 9.5 introduced [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN).\n\n=== Schemas ===\nIn PostgreSQL, a [[Database schema|schema]] holds all objects, except for roles and tablespaces. Schemas effectively act like namespaces, allowing objects of the same name to co-exist in the same database. By default, newly created databases have a schema called ''public'', but any further schemas can be added, and the public schema isn't mandatory.\n\nA {{code|search_path}} setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to {{code|$user, public}} ({{code|$user}} refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.\n\nNon-existent schemas listed in search_path are silently skipped during objects lookup.\n\nNew objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that presently exists) appears first in the search_path.Schema is an outline of database.\n\n=== Data types ===\nA wide variety of native [[data type]]s are supported, including:\n\n* Boolean\n* [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|Arbitrary precision]] numerics\n* Character (text, varchar, char)\n* Binary\n* Date/time (timestamp/time with/without timezone, date, interval)\n* Money\n* Enum\n* Bit strings\n* Text search type\n* Composite\n* HStore, an extension enabled key-value store within PostgreSQL<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/postgresql-nosql-database |title=PostgreSQL, the NoSQL Database &#124; Linux Journal |website=www.linuxjournal.com}}</ref> \n* Arrays (variable length and can be of any data type, including text and composite types) up to 1&nbsp;GB in total storage size\n* Geometric primitives\n* [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] addresses\n* [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) blocks and [[MAC address]]es\n* [[XML]] supporting [[XPath]] queries\n* [[Universally unique identifier]] (UUID)\n* JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]), and a faster [[Binary code|binary]] JSONB (since version 9.4; not the same as [[BSON]]<ref name=\"jsonb\" />)\n\nIn addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL's indexing infrastructures \u2013 GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the [[geographic information system]] (GIS) data types from the [[PostGIS]] project for PostgreSQL.\n\nThere is also a data type called a ''domain'', which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.\n\nA data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between 10:00 am and 11:00 am). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.\n\nCustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the {{kbd|[}}/{{kbd|]}} and {{kbd|(}}/{{kbd|)}} characters respectively. (e.g., {{code|[4,9)}} represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.\n\n=== User-defined objects ===\nNew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:\n\n* Casts\n* Conversions\n* Data types\n* [[Data domain]]s\n* Functions, including aggregate functions and window functions\n* Indexes including custom indexes for custom types\n* Operators (existing ones can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]])\n* Procedural languages\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nTables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a ''parent'' table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. {{code|lang=\"sql\" | SELECT * FROM ONLY parent_table;}}. Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.\n\nInheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, this feature is not fully supported yet \u2013 in particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.\n\nInheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in [[Entity\u2013relationship model|entity relationship diagrams]] (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.\n\n=== Other storage features ===\n* [[Referential integrity]] constraints including [[foreign key]] constraints, column [[Constraint satisfaction |constraints]], and row checks\n* Binary and textual large-object storage\n* [[Tablespace]]s\n* Per-column collation\n* Online backup\n* Point-in-time recovery, implemented using write-ahead logging\n* In-place upgrades with pg_upgrade for less downtime (supports upgrades from 8.3.x and later)\n\n== Control and connectivity ==\n\n=== Foreign data wrappers ===\nPostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Obe\n |first=Regina\n |last2=Hsu\n |first2=Leo S.\n |chapter=10: Replication and External Data\n |title=PostgreSQL: Up and Running\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jkIZkMTPcC\n |edition=1\n |location=Sebastopol, CA\n |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n |date=2012\n |page=129\n |isbn=978-1-4493-2633-3\n |access-date=October 17, 2016\n |quote=Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) [...] are mechanisms of querying external datasources. PostgreSQL 9.1 introduced this [[SQL/MED]] standards compliant feature.\n}}</ref>\nThese can take the form of any data source, such as a file system, another [[relational database]] management system (RDBMS), or a web service. This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.\n\n=== Interfaces ===\nFor connecting to applications, PostgreSQL includes the built-in interfaces libpq (the official C application interface) and [[ECPG]] (an embedded C system). Third-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many [[programming language]]s, including [[C++]],<ref>{{cite web|title=libpqxx|url=http://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web|title=PostgreSQL JDBC Driver|url=https://jdbc.postgresql.org/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]],<ref name=\"psycopg2\" /> [[Node.js]],<ref>{{cite web|title=node-postgres|url=https://node-postgres.com/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Go (programming language)|Go]],<ref>{{cite web |title=SQL database drivers |url=https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers#drivers |website=Go wiki |publisher=golang.org |access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rust-Postgres|url=https://crates.io/crates/postgres|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Procedural languages ===\nProcedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom [[subroutine]]s (functions), often called ''[[stored procedure]]s''. These functions can be used to build [[database trigger]]s (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and [[aggregate function]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-programming.html|title=Server Programming|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-do.html|title=DO|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref>\n\nLanguages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in ''safe'' languages are [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in ''unsafe'' languages can only be created by [[superuser]]s, because they allow bypassing a database's security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.\n\nPostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:\n\n* Plain SQL (safe). Simpler SQL functions can get [[inline expansion|expanded inline]] into the calling (SQL) query, which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to \"see inside\" the function.\n* Procedural Language/PostgreSQL ([[PL/pgSQL]]) (safe), which resembles Oracle's Procedural Language for SQL ([[PL/SQL]]) procedural language and SQL/Persistent Stored Modules ([[SQL/PSM]]).\n* [[C (programming language)|C]] (unsafe), which allows loading one or more custom [[shared library]] into the database. Functions written in C offer the best performance, but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database. Most built-in functions are written in C.\n\nIn addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html|title=PL/Python - Python Procedural Language|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> and [[Tcl]]. There are external projects to add support for many other languages,<ref>{{cite web |date=March 31, 2016 |title=Procedural Languages |publisher=postgresql.org |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/external-pl.html |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] (PL/V8), [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and others.\n\n=== Triggers ===\nTriggers are events triggered by the action of SQL [[data manipulation language]] (DML) statements. For example, an [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]] statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] statements.\n\nTriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger's WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to [[View (SQL)|views]] by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.\n\n=== Asynchronous notifications ===\nPostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.\n\nMany connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.\n\nPostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent [[Publish-subscribe pattern|\"pub/sub\" server]] or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED<ref name=\"postgres-jobserver\">{{cite web |last1=Chartier |first1=Colin |title=System design hack: Postgres is a great pub/sub & job server |url=https://layerci.com/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/ |website=LayerCI blog |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>, a combination which has existed since PostgreSQL version 9.5<ref name=\"release-9.5\">{{cite web |title=Release 9.5 |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/release-9-5.html |website=postgresql.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ringer-skip-locked\">{{cite web |last1=Ringer |first1=Craig |title=What is SKIP LOCKED for in PostgreSQL 9.5? |url=https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/ |website=2nd Quadrant |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Rules ===\nRules allow the \"query tree\" of an incoming query to be rewritten. \"Query Re-Write Rules\" are attached to a table/class and \"Re-Write\" the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing, but before query planning.\n\n=== Other querying features ===\n* [[Database transaction|Transactions]]\n* [[Full-text search]]\n* Views\n** Materialized views<ref name=\"materialized_views\" />\n** Updateable views<ref name=\"updatable_views\" />\n** Recursive views<ref name=\"recursive_views\" />\n* Inner, outer (full, left and right), and cross [[Join (SQL)|joins]]\n* Sub-[[Select (SQL)|selects]]\n** Correlated sub-queries<ref name=\"Introduction and Concepts\" />\n* [[Regular expression]]s<ref name=\"Bernier\" />\n* [[Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL#Common table expression|common table expressions]] and writable common table expressions\n* Encrypted connections via [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS); current versions do not use vulnerable SSL, even with that configuration option<ref name=\"POODLE\" />\n* Domains\n* [[Savepoint]]s\n* [[Two-phase commit protocol|Two-phase commit]]\n* The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST) is used to transparently store large table attributes (such as big MIME attachments or XML messages) in a separate area, with automatic compression.\n* [[Embedded SQL]] is implemented using preprocessor. SQL code is first written embedded into C code. Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor, which replaces SQL with calls to code library. Then code can be compiled using a C compiler. Embedding works also with [[C++]] but it does not recognize all C++ constructs.\n\n=== Concurrency model ===\nPostgreSQL server is [[Process (computing)|process]]-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Starting with PostgreSQL 9.6, many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/689387/ |title=PostgreSQL 9.6 Beta and PGCon 2016 |last=Berkus |first=Josh |date=June 2, 2016 |website=LWN.net}}</ref> Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/FAQ#How_does_PostgreSQL_use_CPU_resources.3F |title=FAQ \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org |language=en |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nPostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-[[Role-oriented programming|role]] basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can also allow/prevent the creation of new objects at the database, schema or table levels.\n\nPostgreSQL's SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) based on [[Security-Enhanced Linux]] (SELinux) security policy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SEPostgreSQL_Documentation |title=SEPostgreSQL Documentation \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://selinuxproject.org/page/NB_SQL_9.3 |title=NB SQL 9.3 - SELinux Wiki |website=selinuxproject.org}}</ref><!--through the use of \"sepgsql extension\"; provided in all supported versions; in \"contrib\"<ref>https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sepgsql.html</ref>).-->\n\nPostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:\n\n* Password: either [[Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism|SCRAM-SHA-256]] (since PostgreSQL 10<ref>{{cite web |title = PostgreSQL 10 Documentation: Appendix E. Release Notes |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.16.3}}</ref>), [[MD5]] or plain-text\n* [[Generic Security Services Application Program Interface]] (GSSAPI)\n* [[Security Support Provider Interface]] (SSPI)\n* [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]\n* [[Ident protocol|ident]] (maps O/S user-name as provided by an ident server to database user-name)\n* Peer (maps local user name to database user name)\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP)\n** [[Active Directory]] (AD)\n* [[RADIUS]]\n* Certificate\n* [[Pluggable authentication module]] (PAM)\n\nThe GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified \"map\" file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.\n\nThese methods are specified in the cluster's host-based authentication configuration file (<kbd>pg_hba.conf</kbd>), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS).\n\n== Standards compliance ==\nPostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the SQL standard. One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded \u2013 internal \u2013 to lower case characters<ref name=\"identifiers\"/> whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, {{code|Foo}} should be equivalent to {{code|FOO}} not {{code|foo}} according to the standard.\n\n== Benchmarks and performance ==\nMany informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done.<ref name=\"Berkus\" /> Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.<ref name=\"Vilmos\" />\n\nThe first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of [[GlassFish]]) 9.0 Platform Edition, [[UltraSPARC T1]]-based [[Sun Fire]] server and PostgreSQL 8.2.<ref name=\"SPECJ\" /> This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an [[Itanium]]-based [[HP-UX]] system.<ref name=\"Berkus\" />\n\nIn August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the [[system under test]] at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.<ref name=\"SPECjAppServer2004\" />\n\nThe default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of [[shared memory]].<ref name=\"Kernel Resources\" /> PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a [[wiki]].<ref name=\"pg9hiperf\" />\n\nIn April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2's linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.<ref name=\"Haas\" />\n\nMatloob Khushi performed benchmarking between Postgresql 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Matloob |last=Khushi |pmid=25560631 |title=Benchmarking database performance for genomic data |journal=J Cell Biochem |date=June 2015 |volume=116 |issue=6 |doi=10.1002/jcb.25049 |pages=877\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Platforms ==\nPostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: [[Linux]] (all recent distributions), 64-bit installers available for [[macOS]] (OS X)<ref name=\"OS X\" /> version 10.6 and newer{{snd}} [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (with installers available for 64-bit version; tested on latest versions and back to [[Windows 2012 R2]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/|title=PostgreSQL: Windows installers|website=www.postgresql.org|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> while for PostgreSQL version 10 and older a 32-bit installer is available and tested down to 32-bit [[Windows 2008]] R1; compilable by e.g. [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], version 2013 up up to most recent 2019 version){{snd}} [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]],<ref name=openbsd>{{cite web |url=http://ports.su/databases/postgresql,-main |title=postgresql-client-10.5p1 \u2013 PostgreSQL RDBMS (client) |work=[[OpenBSD ports]] |date=October 4, 2018 |access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> [[NetBSD]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[UnixWare]]; and not officially tested: [[DragonFly BSD]], [[BSD/OS]], [[IRIX]], [[OpenIndiana]],<ref name=\"OpenIndiana\" /> [[OpenSolaris]], [[OpenServer]]<!--formerly SCO UNIX [..] now owned by Xinuos-->, and [[Tru64 UNIX]].

Beyond these, it is possible to build PostgreSQL for an unsupported CPU by disabling [[spinlock]]s.<ref name=\"SupportedPlatforms\" />\n\n== Database administration ==\n{{See also|Comparison of database tools}}\n\nOpen source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:\n\n; {{anchor|psql}}psql: The primary [[Front and back ends|front-end]] for PostgreSQL is the {{code|psql}} [[command-line program]], which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.\n; {{anchor|pgAdmin}}pgAdmin: The pgAdmin package is a free and open-source [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL, which is supported on many computer platforms.<ref name=\"pgAdmin\" /> The program is available in more than a dozen languages. The first prototype, named pgManager, was written for PostgreSQL 6.3.2 from 1998, and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in later months. The second incarnation (named pgAdmin II) was a complete rewrite, first released on January 16, 2002. The third version, pgAdmin III, was originally released under the [[Artistic License]] and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL. Unlike prior versions that were written in [[Visual Basic]], pgAdmin III is written in C++, using the [[wxWidgets]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://packages.debian.org/jessie/pgadmin3 | title=Debian -- Details of package pgadmin3 in jessie | accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref> framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems.

'''Postgres''', is a [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[relational database]] [[relational database management system|management system]] (RDBMS) emphasizing [[extensibility]] and [[SQL compliance]]. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] database developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"design\" /><ref name=\"about/history\" /> In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for [[SQL]]. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL.<ref name=\"Project name\" />\n\nPostgreSQL features [[Transaction processing|transactions]] with [[ACID (computer science)|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability]] (ACID) properties, automatically updatable [[View (SQL)|view]]s, [[materialized view]]s, [[Database trigger|triggers]], [[foreign key]]s, and [[stored procedure]]s.<ref name=\"intro-whatis\" /> It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to [[data warehouse]]s or [[Web services]] with many [[concurrent user]]s. It is the default database for [[macOS Server]],<ref name=\"OS X Lion Server\" /><ref name=\"MySQL not included\" /><ref name=\"OS X\" /> and is also available for [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\n\n== History ==\nPostgreSQL evolved from the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, [[Michael Stonebraker]], left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.<ref name=\"design\" /> He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the [[Turing Award]] in 2014 for these and other projects,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/stonebraker_1172121.cfm |title=Michael Stonebraker \u2013 A.M. Turing Award Winner |quote=Techniques pioneered in Postgres were widely implemented [..] Stonebraker is the only Turing award winner to have engaged in serial entrepreneurship on anything like this scale, giving him a distinctive perspective on the academic world. |website=amturing.acm.org |language=en |access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> and techniques pioneered in them.\n\nThe new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support [[data type]]s.<ref name=\"Stonebraker\" /> These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships \u2013 something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using ''rules''. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.<ref name=\"pavel-history\" />\n\nStarting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM [[SIGMOD]] Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers<ref> A Brief History of PostgreSQL [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/history.html \"Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support for multiple storage managers, an improved query executor, and a rewritten rule system.\"]. ''postgresql.org''. ''The PostgreSQL Global Development Group'', Retrieved on 18 March 2020.</ref> and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2<ref name=\"University POSTGRES\" /> on June 30, 1994 \u2013 primarily a cleanup \u2013 the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an [[MIT License]] variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced [[QUEL query languages|POSTQUEL query language]] interpreter, which could be interactively used with a [[console application]] named <kbd>''monitor''</kbd>. <!-- See http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/postgres-setup.ps -->\n\nIn 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. <kbd>''monitor''</kbd> was also replaced by <kbd>psql</kbd>. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to [[beta tester]]s on May 5, 1995.<!-- email lists are not citable, however see message 3165 of |url=http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/mail-archive/1995.05.tar.gz |title=Announcement: Postgres95 Beta |author=Andrew K.

Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.\n\nIn 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\" /> The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe project continues to make releases available under its [[free and open-source software]] PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.\n\n== Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) ==\nPostgreSQL manages [[concurrency control|concurrency]] through [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains [[ACID (computer science)|ACID]] principles. PostgreSQL offers three levels of [[isolation (database systems)|transaction isolation]]: Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full [[serializability]] via the serializable [[snapshot isolation]] (SSI) method.<ref name=\"ports\" />\n\n== Storage and replication ==\n\n=== Replication ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes ([[Write-ahead logging|write-ahead logs]] (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.\n\nPostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication<ref name=\"H Online\" /> that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.\n\nStandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.\n\nSynchronous [[multi-master replication]] is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication.<ref name=\"Postgres-XC\" /> It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called [[Postgres-XL]]. Postgres-R is yet another [[Fork (software development)|fork]].<ref name=postgres-r /> Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.<ref name=bdr />\n\nTools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.\n\nSeveral asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:\n\n* [[Slony-I]]\n* Londiste, part of SkyTools (developed by [[Skype]])\n* Bucardo multi-master replication (developed by [[Backcountry.com]])<ref name=\"Fischer\" />\n* [[SymmetricDS]] multi-master, multi-tier replication\n\n=== Indexes ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular [[B-tree]] and [[hash table]] indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees ([[GiST]]), generalized [[inverted index]]es (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST)<ref name=\"SP-GiST\" /> and [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:\n\n* [[Expression index]]es can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function, instead of simply the value of a column.\n* [[Partial index]]es, which only index part of a table, can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement. This allows a smaller index to be created.\n* The planner is able to use multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries, using temporary in-memory [[bitmap index]] operations (useful for [[data warehouse]] applications for joining a large [[fact table]] to smaller [[dimension table]]s such as those arranged in a [[star schema]]).\n* [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbors]] (''k''-NN) indexing (also referred to KNN-GiST<ref name=\"KNN-GiST\" />) provides efficient searching of \"closest values\" to that specified, useful to finding similar words, or close objects or locations with [[Geographic data and information|geospatial]] data. This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values.\n* Index-only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table.\n* PostgreSQL 9.5 introduced [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN).\n\n=== Schemas ===\nIn PostgreSQL, a [[Database schema|schema]] holds all objects, except for roles and tablespaces. Schemas effectively act like namespaces, allowing objects of the same name to co-exist in the same database. By default, newly created databases have a schema called ''public'', but any further schemas can be added, and the public schema isn't mandatory.\n\nA {{code|search_path}} setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to {{code|$user, public}} ({{code|$user}} refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.\n\nNon-existent schemas listed in search_path are silently skipped during objects lookup.\n\nNew objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that presently exists) appears first in the search_path.Schema is an outline of database.\n\n=== Data types ===\nA wide variety of native [[data type]]s are supported, including:\n\n* Boolean\n* [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|Arbitrary precision]] numerics\n* Character (text, varchar, char)\n* Binary\n* Date/time (timestamp/time with/without timezone, date, interval)\n* Money\n* Enum\n* Bit strings\n* Text search type\n* Composite\n* HStore, an extension enabled key-value store within PostgreSQL<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/postgresql-nosql-database |title=PostgreSQL, the NoSQL Database &#124; Linux Journal |website=www.linuxjournal.com}}</ref> \n* Arrays (variable length and can be of any data type, including text and composite types) up to 1&nbsp;GB in total storage size\n* Geometric primitives\n* [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] addresses\n* [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) blocks and [[MAC address]]es\n* [[XML]] supporting [[XPath]] queries\n* [[Universally unique identifier]] (UUID)\n* JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]), and a faster [[Binary code|binary]] JSONB (since version 9.4; not the same as [[BSON]]<ref name=\"jsonb\" />)\n\nIn addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL's indexing infrastructures \u2013 GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the [[geographic information system]] (GIS) data types from the [[PostGIS]] project for PostgreSQL.\n\nThere is also a data type called a ''domain'', which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.\n\nA data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between 10:00 am and 11:00 am). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.\n\nCustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the {{kbd|[}}/{{kbd|]}} and {{kbd|(}}/{{kbd|)}} characters respectively. (e.g., {{code|[4,9)}} represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.\n\n=== User-defined objects ===\nNew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:\n\n* Casts\n* Conversions\n* Data types\n* [[Data domain]]s\n* Functions, including aggregate functions and window functions\n* Indexes including custom indexes for custom types\n* Operators (existing ones can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]])\n* Procedural languages\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nTables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a ''parent'' table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. {{code|lang=\"sql\" | SELECT * FROM ONLY parent_table;}}. Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.\n\nInheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, this feature is not fully supported yet \u2013 in particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.\n\nInheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in [[Entity\u2013relationship model|entity relationship diagrams]] (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.\n\n=== Other storage features ===\n* [[Referential integrity]] constraints including [[foreign key]] constraints, column [[Constraint satisfaction |constraints]], and row checks\n* Binary and textual large-object storage\n* [[Tablespace]]s\n* Per-column collation\n* Online backup\n* Point-in-time recovery, implemented using write-ahead logging\n* In-place upgrades with pg_upgrade for less downtime (supports upgrades from 8.3.x and later)\n\n== Control and connectivity ==\n\n=== Foreign data wrappers ===\nPostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Obe\n |first=Regina\n |last2=Hsu\n |first2=Leo S.\n |chapter=10: Replication and External Data\n |title=PostgreSQL: Up and Running\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jkIZkMTPcC\n |edition=1\n |location=Sebastopol, CA\n |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n |date=2012\n |page=129\n |isbn=978-1-4493-2633-3\n |access-date=October 17, 2016\n |quote=Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) [...] are mechanisms of querying external datasources. PostgreSQL 9.1 introduced this [[SQL/MED]] standards compliant feature.\n}}</ref>\nThese can take the form of any data source, such as a file system, another [[relational database]] management system (RDBMS), or a web service. This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.\n\n=== Interfaces ===\nFor connecting to applications, PostgreSQL includes the built-in interfaces libpq (the official C application interface) and [[ECPG]] (an embedded C system). Third-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many [[programming language]]s, including [[C++]],<ref>{{cite web|title=libpqxx|url=http://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web|title=PostgreSQL JDBC Driver|url=https://jdbc.postgresql.org/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]],<ref name=\"psycopg2\" /> [[Node.js]],<ref>{{cite web|title=node-postgres|url=https://node-postgres.com/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Go (programming language)|Go]],<ref>{{cite web |title=SQL database drivers |url=https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers#drivers |website=Go wiki |publisher=golang.org |access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rust-Postgres|url=https://crates.io/crates/postgres|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Procedural languages ===\nProcedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom [[subroutine]]s (functions), often called ''[[stored procedure]]s''. These functions can be used to build [[database trigger]]s (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and [[aggregate function]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-programming.html|title=Server Programming|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-do.html|title=DO|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref>\n\nLanguages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in ''safe'' languages are [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in ''unsafe'' languages can only be created by [[superuser]]s, because they allow bypassing a database's security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.\n\nPostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:\n\n* Plain SQL (safe). Simpler SQL functions can get [[inline expansion|expanded inline]] into the calling (SQL) query, which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to \"see inside\" the function.\n* Procedural Language/PostgreSQL ([[PL/pgSQL]]) (safe), which resembles Oracle's Procedural Language for SQL ([[PL/SQL]]) procedural language and SQL/Persistent Stored Modules ([[SQL/PSM]]).\n* [[C (programming language)|C]] (unsafe), which allows loading one or more custom [[shared library]] into the database. Functions written in C offer the best performance, but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database. Most built-in functions are written in C.\n\nIn addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html|title=PL/Python - Python Procedural Language|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> and [[Tcl]]. There are external projects to add support for many other languages,<ref>{{cite web |date=March 31, 2016 |title=Procedural Languages |publisher=postgresql.org |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/external-pl.html |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] (PL/V8), [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and others.\n\n=== Triggers ===\nTriggers are events triggered by the action of SQL [[data manipulation language]] (DML) statements. For example, an [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]] statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] statements.\n\nTriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger's WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to [[View (SQL)|views]] by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.\n\n=== Asynchronous notifications ===\nPostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.\n\nMany connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.\n\nPostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent [[Publish-subscribe pattern|\"pub/sub\" server]] or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED<ref name=\"postgres-jobserver\">{{cite web |last1=Chartier |first1=Colin |title=System design hack: Postgres is a great pub/sub & job server |url=https://layerci.com/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/ |website=LayerCI blog |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>, a combination which has existed since PostgreSQL version 9.5<ref name=\"release-9.5\">{{cite web |title=Release 9.5 |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/release-9-5.html |website=postgresql.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ringer-skip-locked\">{{cite web |last1=Ringer |first1=Craig |title=What is SKIP LOCKED for in PostgreSQL 9.5? |url=https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/ |website=2nd Quadrant |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Rules ===\nRules allow the \"query tree\" of an incoming query to be rewritten. \"Query Re-Write Rules\" are attached to a table/class and \"Re-Write\" the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing, but before query planning.\n\n=== Other querying features ===\n* [[Database transaction|Transactions]]\n* [[Full-text search]]\n* Views\n** Materialized views<ref name=\"materialized_views\" />\n** Updateable views<ref name=\"updatable_views\" />\n** Recursive views<ref name=\"recursive_views\" />\n* Inner, outer (full, left and right), and cross [[Join (SQL)|joins]]\n* Sub-[[Select (SQL)|selects]]\n** Correlated sub-queries<ref name=\"Introduction and Concepts\" />\n* [[Regular expression]]s<ref name=\"Bernier\" />\n* [[Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL#Common table expression|common table expressions]] and writable common table expressions\n* Encrypted connections via [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS); current versions do not use vulnerable SSL, even with that configuration option<ref name=\"POODLE\" />\n* Domains\n* [[Savepoint]]s\n* [[Two-phase commit protocol|Two-phase commit]]\n* The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST) is used to transparently store large table attributes (such as big MIME attachments or XML messages) in a separate area, with automatic compression.\n* [[Embedded SQL]] is implemented using preprocessor. SQL code is first written embedded into C code. Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor, which replaces SQL with calls to code library. Then code can be compiled using a C compiler. Embedding works also with [[C++]] but it does not recognize all C++ constructs.\n\n=== Concurrency model ===\nPostgreSQL server is [[Process (computing)|process]]-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Starting with PostgreSQL 9.6, many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/689387/ |title=PostgreSQL 9.6 Beta and PGCon 2016 |last=Berkus |first=Josh |date=June 2, 2016 |website=LWN.net}}</ref> Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/FAQ#How_does_PostgreSQL_use_CPU_resources.3F |title=FAQ \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org |language=en |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nPostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-[[Role-oriented programming|role]] basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can also allow/prevent the creation of new objects at the database, schema or table levels.\n\nPostgreSQL's SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) based on [[Security-Enhanced Linux]] (SELinux) security policy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SEPostgreSQL_Documentation |title=SEPostgreSQL Documentation \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://selinuxproject.org/page/NB_SQL_9.3 |title=NB SQL 9.3 - SELinux Wiki |website=selinuxproject.org}}</ref><!--through the use of \"sepgsql extension\"; provided in all supported versions; in \"contrib\"<ref>https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sepgsql.html</ref>).-->\n\nPostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:\n\n* Password: either [[Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism|SCRAM-SHA-256]] (since PostgreSQL 10<ref>{{cite web |title = PostgreSQL 10 Documentation: Appendix E. Release Notes |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.16.3}}</ref>), [[MD5]] or plain-text\n* [[Generic Security Services Application Program Interface]] (GSSAPI)\n* [[Security Support Provider Interface]] (SSPI)\n* [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]\n* [[Ident protocol|ident]] (maps O/S user-name as provided by an ident server to database user-name)\n* Peer (maps local user name to database user name)\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP)\n** [[Active Directory]] (AD)\n* [[RADIUS]]\n* Certificate\n* [[Pluggable authentication module]] (PAM)\n\nThe GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified \"map\" file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.\n\nThese methods are specified in the cluster's host-based authentication configuration file (<kbd>pg_hba.conf</kbd>), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS).\n\n== Standards compliance ==\nPostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the SQL standard. One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded \u2013 internal \u2013 to lower case characters<ref name=\"identifiers\"/> whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, {{code|Foo}} should be equivalent to {{code|FOO}} not {{code|foo}} according to the standard.\n\n== Benchmarks and performance ==\nMany informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done.<ref name=\"Berkus\" /> Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.<ref name=\"Vilmos\" />\n\nThe first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of [[GlassFish]]) 9.0 Platform Edition, [[UltraSPARC T1]]-based [[Sun Fire]] server and PostgreSQL 8.2.<ref name=\"SPECJ\" /> This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an [[Itanium]]-based [[HP-UX]] system.<ref name=\"Berkus\" />\n\nIn August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the [[system under test]] at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.<ref name=\"SPECjAppServer2004\" />\n\nThe default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of [[shared memory]].<ref name=\"Kernel Resources\" /> PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a [[wiki]].<ref name=\"pg9hiperf\" />\n\nIn April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2's linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.<ref name=\"Haas\" />\n\nMatloob Khushi performed benchmarking between Postgresql 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Matloob |last=Khushi |pmid=25560631 |title=Benchmarking database performance for genomic data |journal=J Cell Biochem |date=June 2015 |volume=116 |issue=6 |doi=10.1002/jcb.25049 |pages=877\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Platforms ==\nPostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: [[Linux]] (all recent distributions), 64-bit installers available for [[macOS]] (OS X)<ref name=\"OS X\" /> version 10.6 and newer{{snd}} [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (with installers available for 64-bit version; tested on latest versions and back to [[Windows 2012 R2]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/|title=PostgreSQL: Windows installers|website=www.postgresql.org|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> while for PostgreSQL version 10 and older a 32-bit installer is available and tested down to 32-bit [[Windows 2008]] R1; compilable by e.g. [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], version 2013 up up to most recent 2019 version){{snd}} [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]],<ref name=openbsd>{{cite web |url=http://ports.su/databases/postgresql,-main |title=postgresql-client-10.5p1 \u2013 PostgreSQL RDBMS (client) |work=[[OpenBSD ports]] |date=October 4, 2018 |access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> [[NetBSD]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[UnixWare]]; and not officially tested: [[DragonFly BSD]], [[BSD/OS]], [[IRIX]], [[OpenIndiana]],<ref name=\"OpenIndiana\" /> [[OpenSolaris]], [[OpenServer]]<!--formerly SCO UNIX [..] now owned by Xinuos-->, and [[Tru64 UNIX]]. Most other Unix-like systems could also work; most modern do support.\n\nPostgreSQL works on any of the following [[instruction set architecture]]s: [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] on Windows and other operating systems; these are supported on other than Windows: IA-64 [[Itanium]] (external support for HP-UX), [[PowerPC]], PowerPC 64, [[IBM System/390|S/390]], [[IBM System z |S/390x]], [[SPARC]], SPARC 64, [[ARMv8]]-A ([[64-bit computing|64-bit]])<ref name=\"AArch64\" /> and older [[ARM architecture|ARM]] ([[32-bit]], including older such as [[ARMv6]] in [[Raspberry Pi]]<ref name=raspi />), [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], MIPSel, and [[PA-RISC]].

Beyond these, it is possible to build PostgreSQL for an unsupported CPU by disabling [[spinlock]]s.<ref name=\"SupportedPlatforms\" />\n\n== Database administration ==\n{{See also|Comparison of database tools}}\n\nOpen source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:\n\n; {{anchor|psql}}psql: The primary [[Front and back ends|front-end]] for PostgreSQL is the {{code|psql}} [[command-line program]], which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.\n; {{anchor|pgAdmin}}pgAdmin: The [[pgAdmin]] package is a free and open-source [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL, which is supported on many computer platforms.<ref name=\"pgAdmin\" /> The program is available in more than a dozen languages. The first prototype, named pgManager, was written for PostgreSQL 6.3.2 from 1998, and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in later months. The second incarnation (named pgAdmin II) was a complete rewrite, first released on January 16, 2002. The third version, pgAdmin III, was originally released under the [[Artistic License]] and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL. Unlike prior versions that were written in [[Visual Basic]], pgAdmin III is written in C++, using the [[wxWidgets]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://packages.debian.org/jessie/pgadmin3 | title=Debian -- Details of package pgadmin3 in jessie | accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref> framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems. The query tool includes a scripting language called pgScript for supporting admin and development tasks. In December 2014, Dave Page, the pgAdmin project founder and primary developer,<ref>{{cite web |title=pgAdmin Development Team |url=http://www.pgadmin.org/development/team.php |website=pgadmin.org |access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> announced that with the shift towards web-based models, work has begun on pgAdmin 4 with the aim to facilitate cloud deployments.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dave |first1=Page |title=The story of pgAdmin |url=http://pgsnake.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-story-of-pgadmin.html |website=Dave's Postgres Blog |publisher=pgsnake.blogspot.co.uk |access-date=December 7, 2014|date=December 7, 2014 }}</ref> In 2016, pgAdmin 4 was released. pgAdmin 4 backend was written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], using Flask and [[Qt (software)|Qt framework]].<ref>{{cite web |title=pgAdmin 4 README |url=https://github.com/postgres/pgadmin4/blob/master/README |access-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n; phpPgAdmin: [[phpPgAdmin]] is a web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL written in PHP and based on the popular [[phpMyAdmin]] interface originally written for [[MySQL]] administration.<ref name=\"PHPADMIN\" />\n; PostgreSQL Studio: PostgreSQL Studio allows users to perform essential PostgreSQL database development tasks from a web-based console.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind.

Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]==\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. It marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref>\n\nOn August 21, Wilder reached the [[Tennessee River]] opposite Chattanooga and ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS/>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires.

To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]==\n\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. It marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref>\n\nOn August 21, Wilder reached the [[Tennessee River]] opposite Chattanooga and ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS/>\n\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\n\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS/>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.
