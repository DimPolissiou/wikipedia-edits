Production is thicker here, with more elastic bounces. If that means it feels like you\u2019ve stepped into a 1980s night at the local bar (as one reviewer humorously put it), then Mohager has clearly succeeded. This is the guy who wasn\u2019t moved to make music until hearing [[Tears for Fears]] in the movie ''[[Real Genius]]'', says the legend; when tracks such as \u201cOrdinary Fools,\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d \u201cMoksha,\" and \u201cDeath Metal Punk\u201d hit you firmly across the ears with their indelible 1980s-styled hooks, everything is working according to his lo-hi-tech plans. Elements of [[Tears for Fears]], [[Duran Duran]], OMD, and [[M83 (band)|M83]] coalesce into a party of their own. \u201cPlum\u201d ends things on a slightly darker Prefab Sprout\u2013style tone.\n\nIn 2013, Mohager received worldwide recognition when his song \u201cSleepwalking\u201d was featured on the soundtrack of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', as well as on the game's official trailer.\n\nIn summer 2014, Mohager teamed up with DJ/producer [[Dillon Francis]], as well as [[Sultan & Ned Shepard]] for the release of \"When We Were Young\".<ref>{{youtube|95-cScAf_40|When We Were Young}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2015, Mohager launched a collaborative side project with Marshall Gallagher of [[Swing Hero]] titled \"[[Teenage Wrist]]\".

Then, on March 22, 2019, Mohager released \u201cHeaven\u201d, produced by [[Chadwick Johnson]] of the band Hundreth. The next month on April 26 followed the release of the third single, \u201cSuch A Shame.\u201d Mohager later stated on [[Twitter]] that the track was inspired by [[Jimmy Eat World]]. On May 24, The Chain Gang of 1974 released the fourth single \u201cOrdinary Fools, Pt. 2\u201d, the follow up to the [[Daydream Forever]] opening track \u201cOrdinary Fools\u201d. On June 21, Mohager released the track \u201cYDLMA\u201d (You Don\u2019t Love Me Anymore). The next month on July 26 saw the release\nOf \u201cFrom Here Who Knows\u201d. This was the last monthly single, and there was not another single in August. Instead of releasing a single in August, Mohager instead announces an upcoming [[Extended play|EP]] entitled \u201cPollen\u201d. The album would consist of the earlier singles \u201cHeaven\u201d, \u201cBurn Out\u201d, and \u201cOrdinary Fools, Pt. 2\u201d, along with a new song titled \u201cHide Tonight\u201d. The EP was released September 6, 2019. Later next month, Mohager announced a new album, and also stated the album would be coming sometime in 2020. The album title is still unknown, but the word \u201cHoney\u201d can be seen as part of the album title in Mohager\u2019s [[Instagram]] story. The album will have 12 tracks, and the remaining singles that weren\u2019t on the \u201cPollen\u201d EP would be included on the album. \u201cSuch A Shame\u201d, \u201cYDLMA\u201d, and \u201cFrom Here Who Knows\u201d.

If that means it feels like you\u2019ve stepped into a 1980s night at the local bar (as one reviewer humorously put it), then Mohager has clearly succeeded. This is the guy who wasn\u2019t moved to make music until hearing [[Tears for Fears]] in the movie ''[[Real Genius]]'', says the legend; when tracks such as \u201cOrdinary Fools,\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d \u201cMoksha,\" and \u201cDeath Metal Punk\u201d hit you firmly across the ears with their indelible 1980s-styled hooks, everything is working according to his lo-hi-tech plans. Elements of [[Tears for Fears]], [[Duran Duran]], OMD, and [[M83 (band)|M83]] coalesce into a party of their own. \u201cPlum\u201d ends things on a slightly darker Prefab Sprout\u2013style tone.\n\nIn 2013, Mohager received worldwide recognition when his song \u201cSleepwalking\u201d was featured on the soundtrack of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', as well as on the game's official trailer.\n\nIn summer 2014, Mohager teamed up with DJ/producer [[Dillon Francis]], as well as [[Sultan & Ned Shepard]] for the release of \"When We Were Young\".<ref>{{youtube|95-cScAf_40|When We Were Young}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2015, Mohager launched a collaborative side project with Marshall Gallagher of [[Swing Hero]] titled \"[[Teenage Wrist]]\". The band's debut single \"Afterglow\" received praise from [[My Chemical Romance]] frontman [[Gerard Way]].\n\n===2016\u20132018: ''Felt''===\nOn September 9, 2016, The Chain Gang of 1974 released his single \"I Still Wonder\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rh7wI3BRE |title=The Chain Gang of 1974 - I Still Wonder - YouTube |publisher=YouTube.com |date=September 9, 2016 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref> On March 26, 2017, The Chain Gang of 1974 announced the release of his new album, ''[[Felt (The Chain Gang of 1974 album)|Felt]]'', which was released on June 23 through Caroline Records.\n\n===2019-Present: ''Pollen & Upcoming Album''===\nOn February 15, 2019, The Chain Gang of 1974 released the single \u201cBurn Out\u201d along with the announcement that he would be releasing one single per month throughout 2019. Then, on March 22, 2019, Mohager released \u201cHeaven\u201d, produced by [[Chadwick Johnson]] of the band Hundreth. The next month on April 26 followed the release of the third single, \u201cSuch A Shame.\u201d Mohager later stated on [[Twitter]] that the track was inspired by [[Jimmy Eat World]]. On May 24, The Chain Gang of 1974 released the fourth single \u201cOrdinary Fools, Pt. 2\u201d, the follow up to the [[Daydream Forever]] opening track \u201cOrdinary Fools\u201d. On June 21, Mohager released the track \u201cYDLMA\u201d (You Don\u2019t Love Me Anymore). The next month on July 26 saw the release\nOf \u201cFrom Here Who Knows\u201d. This was the last monthly single, and there was not another single in August. Instead of releasing a single in August, Mohager instead announces an upcoming [[Extended play|EP]] entitled \u201cPollen\u201d. The album would consist of the earlier singles \u201cHeaven\u201d, \u201cBurn Out\u201d, and \u201cOrdinary Fools, Pt. 2\u201d, along with a new song titled \u201cHide Tonight\u201d. The EP was released September 6, 2019. Later next month, Mohager announced a new album, and also stated the album would be coming sometime in 2020. The album title is still unknown, but the word \u201cHoney\u201d can be seen as part of the album title in Mohager\u2019s [[Instagram]] story. The album will have 12 tracks, and the remaining singles that weren\u2019t on the \u201cPollen\u201d EP would be included on the album. \u201cSuch A Shame\u201d, \u201cYDLMA\u201d, and \u201cFrom Here Who Knows\u201d. Also, Mohager released \u201c20:25\u201d, a collaborative Single with [[Flux Pavillon]] and [[whatsonot]].\n\n==Tour history==\nThe Chain Gang of 1974 has toured alongside bands, including [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Foster the People]], [[The Naked and Famous]], [[Washed Out]], [[Cibo Matto]], [[ABC (band)|ABC]], [[Big Audio Dynamite]], [[Tapes 'n Tapes]], [[Empires (band)|Empires]], [[Sir Sly]], [[Miniature Tigers]], and [[Geographer (band)|Geographer]].\n\n* [[Monolith Festival]] (2008)\n* [[Lollapalooza]] (2011)\n* [[Governors Ball Music Festival]] (2014)\n* [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] (2014)\n* [[Capitol Hill Block Party]] (2014)\n* [[Free Press Summer Fest]] (2014)\n\n==Touring members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*Adam Halferty - drums, bass <small>(2008, 2011)</small>\n*Brandon Anamier \u2013 drums <small>(2008\u20132013)</small>\n*Justin Renaud \u2013 guitar <small>(2010\u20132011, 2016)</small>\n*Tyler Venter \u2013 bass <small>(2010\u20132011)</small>\n*Michael Spear \u2013 bass <small>(2011)</small>\n*Jeff Appruzzese - bass <small>(2011)</small>\n*Xander Singh - bass <small>(2011)</small>\n*Rob Pera - guitar, bass <small>(2011-2012)</small>\n*Jacob Bond \u2013 guitar <small>(2011\u20132014)</small>\n*Sam Tiger \u2013 bass <small>(2012\u20132014)</small>\n*Luc Laurent \u2013 drums <small>(2013\u20132014)</small>\n*Eric Halvorsen \u2013 bass <small>(2016-2017)</small>\n*Mike Robinson \u2013 drums <small>(2016-2017)</small>\n*Troupe Gammage - guitar <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n* ''The Dirt EP'' (February 24, 2007)\n* ''When The Apple Drops - EP'' (January 16, 2008)\n* ''Fantastic Nostalgic: The Early Recordings'' (January 31, 2010)\n* ''White Guts'' (April 27, 2010)\n* ''Wayward Fire'' (June 21, 2011)\n* ''[[Daydream Forever]]'' (February 4, 2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CHAINGANGOF1974/status/404683389644464128 |title=Twitter / CHAINGANGOF1974: New album//DAYDREAM |publisher=Twitter.com |date=November 24, 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref>\n* ''[[Felt (The Chain Gang of 1974 album)|Felt]]'' (June 23, 2017)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CHAINGANGOF1974/status/845314050837774336 |title=Twitter / CHAINGANGOF1974: the new album FELT |publisher=Twitter.com |date=March 24, 2017 |accessdate=2017-03-25}}</ref>\n* ''Pollen - EP'' (September 6, 2019)\n\n==Songs in media==\n* Song \"Make My Body\" featured in ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011).\n* Song \"Hold On\" featured in ''[[FIFA 12]]'' (2011).\n* Song \"Devil Is a Lady\" featured in ''[[FIFA Street (2012 video game)|FIFA Street]]'' (2012) and ''[[MLB 12: The Show]]'' (2012).\n* Song \"Undercover\" featured in ''[[FIFA Street (2012 video game)|FIFA Street]]'' (2012).\n* Song \"[[Sleepwalking (The Chain Gang of 1974 song)|Sleepwalking]]\" featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'': The Official Trailer, can be heard in the game itself as radio music, and on the [[The Music of Grand Theft Auto V|official soundtrack]].

They were introduced to Brisbane radio presenter jockey Bill Gates by [[Dirt track racing|speedway]] promoter and driver Bill Goode, who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the Redcliffe Speedway in 1960. The crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys, who generally performed during the interval of meetings (usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track) and, in a deal with Goode, any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep. Gates renamed them the BGs (later changed to \"Bee Gees\") after his, Goode's and Barry Gibb's initials.

A second compilation album, ''[[Best of Bee Gees, Volume 2]]'', was released in 1973, although it did not repeat the success of [[Best of Bee Gees|Volume 1]].

The resulting LP, ''[[Mr. Natural (Bee Gees album)|Mr. Natural]]'', included fewer ballads and foreshadowed the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] direction of the rest of their career. When it, too, failed to attract much interest, Mardin encouraged them to work within the soul music style. The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist [[Alan Kendall]] had come on board in 1971 but did not have much to do until ''Mr. Natural''. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-[[Strawbs]] keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late '70s. Maurice, who had previously performed on piano, guitar, harpsichord, electric piano, organ, [[mellotron]] and bass guitar, as well as [[mandolin]] and [[Moog synthesiser]], by then confined himself to bass onstage.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n===1975\u20131979: Turning to disco===\n\n====''Main Course'' and ''Children of the World''====\n[[File:Bee Gees' wordmark logo (1975-1981).gif|thumb|right|Bee Gees' wordmark logo (1975\u201381)]]\nAt [[Eric Clapton]]'s suggestion, the brothers moved to [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], early in 1975 to record at [[Criteria Studios]]. After starting off with ballads, they eventually heeded the urging of Mardin and Stigwood, and crafted more dance-oriented [[disco]] songs, including their second US No. 1, \"[[Jive Talkin']]\", along with US No. 7 \"[[Nights on Broadway]]\". The band liked the resulting new sound. This time the public agreed by sending the LP ''[[Main Course]]'' up the charts. This album included the first Bee Gees songs wherein Barry used [[falsetto]],<ref>{{cite web | last =James|first=Nicholas|title=Main Course \u2013 Bee Gees|url= http://www.beegeesreviews.info/reviews/maincourse.htm|work= Bee gees reviews |accessdate= 8 December 2012}}</ref> something that would later become a trademark of the band.

Bee Gees... Live]]'', the Bee Gees agreed with Stigwood to participate in the creation of the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack]]. It would be the turning point of their career. The cultural impact of both the film and the soundtrack was seismic throughout the world, prolonging the [[disco]] scene's mainstream appeal.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe band's involvement in the film did not begin until post-production.

We didn't know what was going to happen.<ref name = \"Kashner\" />}}\n\nBill Oakes, who supervised the soundtrack, asserts that ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' did not begin the disco craze but rather prolonged it: \"Disco had run its course. These days, ''Fever'' is credited with kicking off the whole disco thing\u2014it really didn't.

Such was the popularity of ''Saturday Night Fever'' that two different versions of the song \"[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]\" received airplay, one by the Bee Gees, which was relegated to an album track, and another by [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]], which was the hit.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring a nine-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1978|seven songs]] written by the brothers held the No. 1 position on the US charts for 27 of 37 consecutive weeks: three of their own releases, two for brother [[Andy Gibb]], the [[Yvonne Elliman]] single, and \"[[Grease (song)|Grease]]\", performed by [[Frankie Valli]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nFuelled by the film's success, the soundtrack broke multiple industry records, becoming the highest-selling album in recording history to that point.

On the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for 25 March 1978, five songs written by the Gibbs were in the US top 10 at the same time: \"Night Fever\", \"Stayin' Alive\", \"If I Can't Have You\", \"Emotion\" and \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\". Such chart dominance had not been seen since April 1964, when the Beatles had all five of the top five American singles. Barry Gibb became the only songwriter to have four consecutive number-one hits in the US, breaking the [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] 1964 record. These songs were \"Stayin' Alive\", \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\", \"Night Fever\" and \"If I Can't Have You\".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Bee Gees won five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''Saturday Night Fever'' over two years: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year]] (with Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson), two awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] (one in 1978 for \"How Deep Is Your Love\" and one in 1979 for \"Stayin' Alive\"), and [[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices|Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices]] for \"Stayin' Alive\".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring this era, Barry and Robin also wrote \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" for an old friend, Australian vocalist [[Samantha Sang]], who made it a top 10 hit, with the Bee Gees singing backing vocals. Barry also wrote the title song to the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' for [[Frankie Valli]] to perform, which went to No. 1.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Bee Gees also co-starred with [[Peter Frampton]] in Robert Stigwood's film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1978), loosely inspired by the classic 1967 album by the Beatles. The movie had been heavily promoted prior to release and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, it was savaged by film critics as a disjointed mess and ignored by the public. Though some of its tracks charted, the soundtrack too was a high-profile flop. The single \"[[Oh! Darling]]\", credited to Robin Gibb, reached No. 15 in the US.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Bee Gees' follow-up to ''Saturday Night Fever'' was the ''[[Spirits Having Flown]]'' album. It yielded three more hits: \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" (US No. 1, UK No. 3), \"[[Tragedy (Bee Gees song)|Tragedy]]\" (US No. 1, UK No. 1), and \"[[Love You Inside Out]]\" (US No. 1, UK No. 13).<ref name=\"Charts\"/> This gave the act six consecutive No. 1 singles in the US within a year and a half, equalling the Beatles and surpassed only by [[Whitney Houston]].<ref name=\"singles\">{{vcite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Jet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54|date=2 May 1988|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=54|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> \n\nIn January 1979, the Bee Gees performed \"Too Much Heaven\" as their contribution to the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>Fred Bronson, \"Too Much Heaven\", in ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits''  (Los Angeles: Billboard Books, 2003), 496. {{ISBN|0823076776}}, 9780823076772</ref> During the summer of 1979, the Bee Gees embarked on their largest concert tour covering the US and Canada. The [[1979 Spirits Having Flown Tour|Spirits Having Flown tour]] capitalised on Bee Gees fever that was sweeping the nation, with sold-out concerts in 38 cities. The Bee Gees produced a video for the title track \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\", directed by Miami-based filmmaker Martin Pitts and produced by Charles Allen. With this video, Pitts and Allen began a long association with the brothers.<ref>On Pitts, see https://imvdb.com/n/martin-pitts</ref>\n\nThe Bee Gees even had a country hit in 1979 with \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\", the flip side of their pop hit \"Too Much Heaven\", which made the top 40 on the country charts.

By the end of 1979, disco was rapidly declining in popularity, and the backlash against disco put the Bee Gees' American career in a tailspin. Radio stations around the US began promoting \"Bee Gee-Free Weekends\". Following their remarkable run from 1975 to 1979, the act would have only one more top 10 single in the US, and that would not come until the single \"'''One'''\" reached number 7 in 1989.<ref name=\"rank\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/487819/bee-gees-rank-third-among-groups-for-most-hot-100-no-1s-in-history|title=Bee Gees Rank Third Among Groups for Most Hot 100 No. 1s in History| publisher=Billboard| accessdate =9 November 2019|date=21 May 2012|first=Keith|last=Caulfield }}</ref>\n\nBarry Gibb considered the success of the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack both a blessing and a curse:\n{{quote|''Fever'' was No. 1 every week&nbsp;...

Their lineup consisted of brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin Gibb|Robin]], and [[Maurice Gibb]]. The trio were especially successful as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later as prominent performers of the [[disco]] music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part [[Close and open harmony|tight harmonies]]; Robin's clear [[vibrato]] lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[falsetto]] became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.\n\nBorn on the [[Isle of Man]] to [[English people|English]] parents, the Gibb brothers lived in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy|Chorlton]], [[Manchester]], [[England]] until the late 1950s.

The young brothers began performing to raise pocket money. They were introduced to Brisbane radio presenter jockey Bill Gates by [[Dirt track racing|speedway]] promoter and driver Bill Goode, who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the Redcliffe Speedway in 1960. The crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys, who generally performed during the interval of meetings (usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track) and, in a deal with Goode, any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep. Gates renamed them the BGs (later changed to \"Bee Gees\") after his, Goode's and Barry Gibb's initials.

It was at this time that they met the American-born songwriter, producer and entrepreneur [[Nat Kipner]], who had just been appointed A&R manager of a new independent label, [[Spin Records (Australian Label)|Spin Records]].

To accompany the album, they also filmed a TV special which aired on the BBC in 1971.

The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist [[Alan Kendall]] had come on board in 1971 but did not have much to do until ''Mr. Natural''. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-[[Strawbs]] keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late '70s.

Such was the popularity of ''Saturday Night Fever'' that two different versions of the song \"[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]\" received airplay, one by the Bee Gees, which was relegated to an album track, and another by [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]], which was the hit.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring a nine-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1978|seven songs]] written by the brothers held the No. 1 position on the US charts for 27 of 37 consecutive weeks: three of their own releases, two for brother [[Andy Gibb]], the [[Yvonne Elliman]] single, and \"[[Grease (song)|Grease]]\", performed by [[Frankie Valli]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nFuelled by the film's success, the soundtrack broke multiple industry records, becoming the highest-selling album in recording history to that point.

On the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for 25 March 1978, five songs written by the Gibbs were in the US top 10 at the same time: \"Night Fever\", \"Stayin' Alive\", \"If I Can't Have You\", \"Emotion\" and \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\". Such chart dominance had not been seen since April 1964, when the Beatles had all five of the top five American singles. Barry Gibb became the only songwriter to have four consecutive number-one hits in the US, breaking the [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] 1964 record. These songs were \"Stayin' Alive\", \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\", \"Night Fever\" and \"If I Can't Have You\".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Bee Gees won five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''Saturday Night Fever'' over two years: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year]] (with Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson), two awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] (one in 1978 for \"How Deep Is Your Love\" and one in 1979 for \"Stayin' Alive\"), and [[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices|Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices]] for \"Stayin' Alive\".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring this era, Barry and Robin also wrote \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" for an old friend, Australian vocalist [[Samantha Sang]], who made it a top 10 hit, with the Bee Gees singing backing vocals. Barry also wrote the title song to the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' for [[Frankie Valli]] to perform, which went to No. 1.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Bee Gees also co-starred with [[Peter Frampton]] in Robert Stigwood's film ''[[Sgt.

The movie had been heavily promoted prior to release and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, it was savaged by film critics as a disjointed mess and ignored by the public. Though some of its tracks charted, the soundtrack too was a high-profile flop. The single \"[[Oh!

The Bee Gees produced a video for the title track \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\", directed by Miami-based filmmaker Martin Pitts and produced by Charles Allen. With this video, Pitts and Allen began a long association with the brothers.<ref>On Pitts, see https://imvdb.com/n/martin-pitts</ref>\n\nThe Bee Gees even had a country hit in 1979 with \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\", the flip side of their pop hit \"Too Much Heaven\", which made the top 40 on the country charts.

By the end of 1979, disco was rapidly declining in popularity, and the backlash against disco put the Bee Gees' American career in a tailspin. Radio stations around the US began promoting \"Bee Gee-Free Weekends\".

Early on, the Manichaean religion was strongly associated  with [[Sogdia]]n merchants, and, later, with [[Uyghurs]] resident in the Tang state. The religion was, however, primarily present in northern and central China (the [[Yangtze]] region) and suffered a strong setback during the anti-Manichaean campaign of 843, the prelude to the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] of 845, when foreign Manichaean priests were exiled or executed.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=231\u2013239,263}}</ref>\n\nIt was in the 10th century, after the fall of the Tang, that Manichaeism, now primarily practised by [[Han Chinese]], reached Fujian. Its arrival in the province is linked to a certain Manichaean preacher who fled to Fujian from persecutions in [[North China]], traveled extensively throughout the province, and eventually died and was buried in Quanzhou Prefecture,<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|p=264}}</ref> which thus became one of the centers of [[Chinese Manichaeism]] during the [[Song dynasty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|p=267}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jinjiang Cao'an 20120229-03.jpg|thumb|left|General view of Cao'an Temple]]\nManichaeism in China assumed certain Chinese characteristics, assimilating to both [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1987|p=316}}</ref> \nChinese translations of Manichaean treatises were couched in Buddhist phraseology,<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1987|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref> and the religion's founder ([[Mar]]) [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (known in China as (\u672b)\u6469\u5c3c,  ''(Mo)-Mani'') received the title of the  \"Buddha of Light\" ({{zh|c=\u5149\u660e\u4f5b}} or {{lang|zh|\u5149\u4f5b}}), and a life story resembling that of [[Gautama Buddha]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=243,255\u2013257}}</ref> At the same time, the Taoist (or pseudo-Taoist?) treatise, the ''[[Huahujing]]'' \"Scripture of the Conversion of the Barbarians\", popular with Chinese Manichaeans, declared Mani to be a reincarnation of [[Laozi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=258\u2013259}}.</ref>  As to the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] civil authorities of the Song state, when the clandestine cells of Mani's followers came to their attention, they were usually lumped together with assorted other suspicious and potentially troublesome sects as \"vegetarian demon worshipers\" ({{zh|\u5403\u83dc\u4e8b\u9b54}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=280\u2013283,298}}</ref>\n\nNot surprisingly, such Manichaean temples as were erected in Song China usually had an official Buddhist or Taoist affiliation.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=268}}</ref> There are records, for example, of a Manichaean temple in Taoist disguise at [[Siming District|Siming]]. This temple - one of the northernmost known Manichaean sites of the Song era - was established in the 960s, and was still active - in a more standard Taoist way, but with a memory of Manichaeism retained - in the 1260s.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=268,292\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jinjiang Cao'an 20120229-09.jpg|thumb|General view of the temple<!--\u8349\u5eb5\u5750\u4e1c\u671d\u897f\uff0c\u80cc\u4f9d\u5c71\u5ca9\uff0c\u5355\u6a90\u6b47\u5c71\u5f0f-->]]\nThe temple is said to have been initially constructed during the reign of [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]], the first emperor of the [[Southern Song]] (mid-12th century), as a straw hut. It was rebuilt in a more permanent way in the 5th year of the Zhiyuan era of [[Toghon Tem\u00fcr]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1339).\n\nManichaeism in China became gradually extinct during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and practically forgotten by the close of the Ming period; little material is available on the last centuries of the religion's existence. A short poem by Huang Fengxiang (d. 1614) tells about his visit to Cao'an Temple, which at the time had already been abandoned. The poet mentions Buddhist and Taoist symbols, but shows no awareness on its author's part of the temple's Manichaean origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|p=303}}</ref>\n\nThe Quanzhou historian He Qiaoyuan left a short account of the shrine on Huabiao Hill and its Manichaean origin in the ''Book of Fujian'', which also gave him a reason to summarize what little he knew about the Manichaeans.

According to an [[Epigraphy|inscription]], the statue was donated to the temple by a local adherent in 1339.\n\nWhile the statue may look like any other Buddha to a casual observer, experts note a number of peculiarities which distinguish it from a [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha|typical portrayal]] of the Buddha.

Early on, the Manichaean religion was strongly associated  with [[Sogdia]]n merchants, and, later, with [[Uyghurs]] resident in the Tang state. The religion was, however, primarily present in northern and central China (the [[Yangtze]] region) and suffered a strong setback during the anti-Manichaen campaign of 843, the prelude to the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] of 845, when foreign Manichaean priests were exiled or executed.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=231\u2013239,263}}</ref>\n\nIt was in the 10th century, after the fall of the Tang, that Manichaeism, now primarily practised by [[Han Chinese]], reached Fujian. Its arrival in the province is linked to a certain Manichaean preacher who fled to Fujian from persecutions in [[North China]], traveled extensively throughout the province, and eventually died and was buried in Quanzhou Prefecture,<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|p=264}}</ref> which thus became one of the centers of [[Chinese Manichaeism]] during the [[Song dynasty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|p=267}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jinjiang Cao'an 20120229-03.jpg|thumb|left|General view of Cao'an Temple]]\nManichaeism in China assumed certain Chinese characteristics, assimilating to both [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1987|p=316}}</ref> \nChinese translations of Manichaean treatises were couched in Buddhist phraseology,<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1987|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref> and the religion's founder ([[Mar]]) [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (known in China as (\u672b)\u6469\u5c3c,  ''(Mo)-Mani'') received the title of the  \"Buddha of Light\" ({{zh|c=\u5149\u660e\u4f5b}} or {{lang|zh|\u5149\u4f5b}}), and a life story resembling that of [[Gautama Buddha]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=243,255\u2013257}}</ref> At the same time, the Taoist (or pseudo-Taoist?) treatise, the ''[[Huahujing]]'' \"Scripture of the Conversion of the Barbarians\", popular with Chinese Manichaeans, declared Mani to be a reincarnation of [[Laozi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=258\u2013259}}.</ref>  As to the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] civil authorities of the Song state, when the clandestine cells of Mani's followers came to their attention, they were usually lumped together with assorted other suspicious and potentially troublesome sects as \"vegetarian demon worshipers\" ({{zh|\u5403\u83dc\u4e8b\u9b54}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=280\u2013283,298}}</ref>\n\nNot surprisingly, such Manichaean temples as were erected in Song China usually had an official Buddhist or Taoist affiliation.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|pp=268}}</ref> There are records, for example, of a Manichaean temple in Taoist disguise at [[Siming District|Siming]].

It was rebuilt in a more permanent way in the 5th year of the Zhiyuan era of [[Toghon Tem\u00fcr]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1339).\n\nManichaeism in China became gradually extinct during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and practically forgotten by the close of the Ming period; little material is available on the last centuries of the religion's existence. A short poem by Huang Fengxiang (d. 1614) tells about his visit to Cao'an Temple, which at the time had already been abandoned. The poet mentions Buddhist and Taoist symbols, but shows no awareness on its author's part of the temple's Manichaean origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Lieu|1992|p=303}}</ref>\n\nThe Quanzhou historian He Qiaoyuan left a short account of the shrine on Huabiao Hill and its Manichaean origin in the ''Book of Fujian'', which also gave him a reason to summarize what little he knew about the Manichaeans.
