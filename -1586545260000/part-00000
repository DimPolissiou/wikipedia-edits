It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].[[File:Road at Keenagh (geograph 2868632).jpg|thumb|Road at Keenagh (geograph 2868632)]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nKeenagh is bounded on the north by [[Kilsallagh]] and [[Munlough North]] townlands, on the west by [[Cor, Templeport]] townland,  on the south by [[Lissanover]] townland and on the east by [[Munlough South]] townland. Its chief geographical features are a wood, a stream and a dug well. Keenagh is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 62 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kennagh''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Kinagh''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Knough''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\nKeenagh formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and  kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Keenagh was one of these four polls.\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the farm, termons or hospitals of Tampleporte containing 4 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 10 shillings'' to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]]. Keenagh was one of these pulls.\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a further lease of ''the farms, termons or hospitals of Templeport containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 13 shillings'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]].'' Keenagh was one of these pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Keenagh was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. Keenagh formed part of this lease.\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Templepart'' to Oliver Lambert\u2019s son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor ''The Lord of Cavan''.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kinagh''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf}]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts Keenagh as still belonging to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. The tenants on the land were Felix Rourke, William Kernan, Philip Plunket and James Plunket.\n\nIn the 1825 Registry of Freeholders for County Cavan there were two freeholders registered in Keenagh- Philip Plunket and John Plunket. They were both [[Forty-shilling freeholders]] holding a lease for lives from their landlord, [[Nathaniel Sneyd]] M.P. of [[Ballyconnell]].

It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and  kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Keenagh was one of these four polls.\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the farm, termons or hospitals of Tampleporte containing 4 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 10 shillings'' to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]]. Keenagh was one of these pulls.\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a further lease of ''the farms, termons or hospitals of Templeport containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 13 shillings'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]].'' Keenagh was one of these pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Keenagh was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. Keenagh formed part of this lease.\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Templepart'' to Oliver Lambert\u2019s son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor ''The Lord of Cavan''.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kinagh''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf}]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts Keenagh as still belonging to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]].

{"title_page": "IETF language tag", "text_new": "IETF language tag\n\nAn IETF BCP 47 language tag is a code to identify human languages. For example, the tag en stands for English; es-419 for Latin American Spanish; rm-sursilv for Sursilvan; gsw-u-sd-chzh for Z\u00fcrich German; nan-Hant-TW for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters. To distinguish language variants for countries, regions, writing systems etc., IETF language tags combine subtags from other standards such as ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1, and UN M.49. The tag structure has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in Best Current Practice (BCP) 47; the subtags are maintained by the IANA Language Subtag Registry.[1][2][3] IETF language tags are used by computing standards such as HTTP,[4], HTML,[5]XML,[6] and PNG.[7]\n\n== History ==\nIETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by [[Harald Tveit Alvestrand]], published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.\n\nIn January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.\n\nThe next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> (which deals with matching behaviour).  <nowiki>RFC 4646</nowiki> introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with <nowiki>RFC 3066</nowiki>.\n\nThe current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html Language Tag Registry Update charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210235400/http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html |date=2007-02-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Syntax of language tags ==\nEach language tag is composed of one or more \"subtags\" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.\n\nWith the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an ''x-'' prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an ''i-'' prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:\n* A single ''primary language subtag'' based on a two-letter language code from [[ISO 639-1]] (2002) or a three-letter code from [[ISO 639-2]] (1998), [[ISO 639-3]] (2007) or [[ISO 639-5]] (2008), or registered through the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters;\n* Up to three optional ''extended language subtags'' composed of three letters each, separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.)\n* An optional ''script subtag'', based on a four-letter script code from [[ISO 15924]] (usually written in [[Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles|Title Case]]);\n* An optional ''region subtag'' based on a two-letter country code from [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] (usually written in upper case), or a three-digit code from [[UN M.49]] for geographical regions;\n* Optional ''variant subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not associated with any external standard.)\n* Optional ''extension subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of a single character, with the exception of the letter ''x'', and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens;\n* An optional ''private-use subtag'', composed of the letter ''x'' and a hyphen followed by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens.\n\nSubtags are not [[case-sensitive]], but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are [[UPPERCASE]], script subtags are [[titlecase|Title Case]], and all other subtags are [[lowercase]]. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.\n\nOptional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag.  For example, ''es'' is preferred over ''es-Latn'', as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; ''ja'' is preferred over ''ja-JP'', as Japanese ''as used in Japan'' does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.\n\nNot all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags.  For example, the ''valencia'' variant subtag for the [[Valencian]] dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix ''ca''.  As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ''ES'' can normally be omitted.\n\nIETF language tags have been used as [[locale (computer software)|locale]] identifiers in many applications.  It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> is not adequate.\n\nThe use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in <nowiki>RFC 5646</nowiki> and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki>.  The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags.  Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them.  These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.\n\n== Relation to other standards ==\nAlthough some types of subtags are derived from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[United Nations|UN]] core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166]], or [[UN M.49]] remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.\n\nThis stability was introduced in RFC 4646.\n\n=== ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-1 ===\nRFC 4646 defined the concept of an \"extended language subtag\" (sometimes referred to as ''extlang''), although no such subtags were registered at that time.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ltru-4646bis\n|title=Tags for Identifying Languages (old draft for the revision of RFC 4646, now obsolete and may disappear soon)\n|author=Addison Phillips, [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]]\n|year=2008\n|publisher=IETF WG LTRU\n|accessdate=2008-06-23 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ltru-4645bis\n|title=Update to the Language Subtag Registry (old draft for the revision of RFC 4645, now obsolete and may disappear soon)\n|author=Doug Ewell\n|year=2008\n|format=1MB\n|publisher=IETF WG LTRU\n|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}\n\nRFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to [[ISO 639-3]] codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix ''sgn''. These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (''cmn'' for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (''zh-cmn''). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called \"extlang form\" and is new in RFC 5646.\n\nWhole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as \"grandfathered\" or \"redundant\" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3\u2013based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, ''nan'' is preferred over ''zh-min-nan'' for [[Min Nan]] Chinese; ''hak'' is preferred over ''i-hak'' and ''zh-hakka'' for [[Hakka Chinese]]; and ''ase'' is preferred over ''sgn-US'' for [[American Sign Language]].\n\n=== ISO 639-5 and ISO 639-2 ===\n[[ISO 639-5]] defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.\n\nFor example, the ISO 639-2 code ''afa'' was previously associated with the name \"Afro-Asiatic (Other)\", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named \"Afro-Asiatic languages\" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php|title=ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).\n\nBCP 47 defines a \"Scope\" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.\n\nISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as \"Multiple languages\" and \"Undetermined\".\n\nIn contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.\n\n=== ISO 15924, ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===\nScript subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in [[ISO 15924]]. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.\n\nSome primary language subtags are defined with a property named \"Suppress-Script\" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, ''yi'' is preferred over ''yi-Hebr'' in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the [[Yiddish]] language.\n\nAs another example, ''zh-Hans-SG'' may be considered equivalent to ''zh-Hans'', because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.\n\nNote that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, ''Hans'' and ''Hant'' for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within [[Unicode]] and [[ISO/IEC 10646]]. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, ''Latf'' and ''Latg'' script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.\n\n=== ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49 ===\n{{Further|Country code top-level domain#Historical ccTLDs}}\n\nTwo-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or \"exceptionally reserved\", in [[ISO 3166-1]]. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on [[UN M.49]] would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as <code>005</code> for South America.\n\nRegion subtags are used to specify the variety of a language \"as used in\" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing [[British English]] (''en-GB'') from [[American English]] (''en-US''). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] versus [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, ''zh-Hans'' and ''zh-Hant'' should be used instead of ''zh-CN'' and ''zh-HK''.\n\nWhen a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, ''ar-DZ'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] as used in [[Algeria]]) may be better expressed as ''arq'' for [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian Spoken Arabic]].\n\n== Extensions ==\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2019}}\n''Extension subtags'' (not to be confused with ''extended language subtags'') allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency.\n\nExtension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than ''x''), called a ''singleton''. Each extension is described in its own [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]], which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] is responsible for allocating singletons.\n\nTwo extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.\n\n=== Extension T (Transformed Content) ===\nExtension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag ''en-t-jp'' could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard.\n\nExtension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].\n\n=== Extension U (Unicode Locale) ===\nExtension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include country subdivisions, calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification.\n\nSome examples include:\n* ''gsw-u-sd-chzh'' represents [[Swiss German]] as used in the [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich]].\n* ''ar-u-nu-latn'' represents Arabic-language content using [[Arabic numerals|Basic Latin digits]] (0 through 9) instead of [[Eastern Arabic numerals|Arabic-script digits]] (\u0660 through \u0669).\n* ''he-IL-u-ca-hebrew-tz-jeruslm'' represents Hebrew as spoken in Israel, using the traditional [[Hebrew calendar]], and in the \"Asia/Jerusalem\" time zone as identified in the [[tz database]].\n\nExtension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Codes for constructed languages]]\n* [[Internationalization and localization]]\n* [[Locale (computer software)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt BCP 47 Language Tags] \u2013 current specification (contains two RFCs, RFC 5646 and RFC 4647 published separately at different dates, but concatenated in a single document)\n** (also referencing the related informational RFC 5645, which complements the previous informational RFC 4645, as well other individual registration forms published separately by others for each language added or modified in the Registry between these BCP 47 revisions)\n* [http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry Language Subtag Registry] \u2013 maintained by IANA\n* [https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/ Language Subtag Registry Search] \u2013 find subtags and view entries in the Registry\n* [https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/index.en Language tags in HTML and XML] \u2013 from the W3C\n* http://www.langtag.net/\n\n[[Category:Internet governance]]\n[[Category:Request for Comments]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]\n[[Category:Language identifiers]]\n[[Category:Unique identifiers]]\n[[Category:Internationalization and localization]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|abbreviated language code defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)}}\n\nAn '''IETF BCP 47 language tag''' is a [[Language code | code]] to identify [[Language | human languages]].

The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.\n\nIn January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.\n\nThe next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> (which deals with matching behaviour).  <nowiki>RFC 4646</nowiki> introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with <nowiki>RFC 3066</nowiki>.\n\nThe current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html Language Tag Registry Update charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210235400/http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html |date=2007-02-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Syntax of language tags ==\nEach language tag is composed of one or more \"subtags\" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.\n\nWith the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an ''x-'' prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an ''i-'' prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:\n* A single ''primary language subtag'' based on a two-letter language code from [[ISO 639-1]] (2002) or a three-letter code from [[ISO 639-2]] (1998), [[ISO 639-3]] (2007) or [[ISO 639-5]] (2008), or registered through the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters;\n* Up to three optional ''extended language subtags'' composed of three letters each, separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.)\n* An optional ''script subtag'', based on a four-letter script code from [[ISO 15924]] (usually written in [[Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles|Title Case]]);\n* An optional ''region subtag'' based on a two-letter country code from [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] (usually written in upper case), or a three-digit code from [[UN M.49]] for geographical regions;\n* Optional ''variant subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not associated with any external standard.)\n* Optional ''extension subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of a single character, with the exception of the letter ''x'', and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens;\n* An optional ''private-use subtag'', composed of the letter ''x'' and a hyphen followed by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens.\n\nSubtags are not [[case-sensitive]], but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are [[UPPERCASE]], script subtags are [[titlecase|Title Case]], and all other subtags are [[lowercase]]. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.\n\nOptional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag.  For example, ''es'' is preferred over ''es-Latn'', as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; ''ja'' is preferred over ''ja-JP'', as Japanese ''as used in Japan'' does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.\n\nNot all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags.  For example, the ''valencia'' variant subtag for the [[Valencian]] dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix ''ca''.  As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ''ES'' can normally be omitted.\n\nIETF language tags have been used as [[locale (computer software)|locale]] identifiers in many applications.  It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> is not adequate.\n\nThe use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in <nowiki>RFC 5646</nowiki> and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki>.  The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags.  Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them.  These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.\n\n== Relation to other standards ==\nAlthough some types of subtags are derived from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[United Nations|UN]] core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166]], or [[UN M.49]] remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.\n\nThis stability was introduced in RFC 4646.\n\n=== ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-1 ===\nRFC 4646 defined the concept of an \"extended language subtag\" (sometimes referred to as ''extlang''), although no such subtags were registered at that time.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ltru-4646bis\n|title=Tags for Identifying Languages (old draft for the revision of RFC 4646, now obsolete and may disappear soon)\n|author=Addison Phillips, [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]]\n|year=2008\n|publisher=IETF WG LTRU\n|accessdate=2008-06-23 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ltru-4645bis\n|title=Update to the Language Subtag Registry (old draft for the revision of RFC 4645, now obsolete and may disappear soon)\n|author=Doug Ewell\n|year=2008\n|format=1MB\n|publisher=IETF WG LTRU\n|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}\n\nRFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to [[ISO 639-3]] codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix ''sgn''. These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (''cmn'' for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (''zh-cmn''). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called \"extlang form\" and is new in RFC 5646.\n\nWhole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as \"grandfathered\" or \"redundant\" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3\u2013based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, ''nan'' is preferred over ''zh-min-nan'' for [[Min Nan]] Chinese; ''hak'' is preferred over ''i-hak'' and ''zh-hakka'' for [[Hakka Chinese]]; and ''ase'' is preferred over ''sgn-US'' for [[American Sign Language]].\n\n=== ISO 639-5 and ISO 639-2 ===\n[[ISO 639-5]] defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.\n\nFor example, the ISO 639-2 code ''afa'' was previously associated with the name \"Afro-Asiatic (Other)\", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named \"Afro-Asiatic languages\" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php|title=ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).\n\nBCP 47 defines a \"Scope\" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.\n\nISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as \"Multiple languages\" and \"Undetermined\".\n\nIn contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.\n\n=== ISO 15924, ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===\nScript subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in [[ISO 15924]]. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.\n\nSome primary language subtags are defined with a property named \"Suppress-Script\" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, ''yi'' is preferred over ''yi-Hebr'' in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the [[Yiddish]] language.\n\nAs another example, ''zh-Hans-SG'' may be considered equivalent to ''zh-Hans'', because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.\n\nNote that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, ''Hans'' and ''Hant'' for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within [[Unicode]] and [[ISO/IEC 10646]]. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, ''Latf'' and ''Latg'' script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.\n\n=== ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49 ===\n{{Further|Country code top-level domain#Historical ccTLDs}}\n\nTwo-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or \"exceptionally reserved\", in [[ISO 3166-1]]. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on [[UN M.49]] would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as <code>005</code> for South America.\n\nRegion subtags are used to specify the variety of a language \"as used in\" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing [[British English]] (''en-GB'') from [[American English]] (''en-US''). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] versus [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, ''zh-Hans'' and ''zh-Hant'' should be used instead of ''zh-CN'' and ''zh-HK''.\n\nWhen a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, ''ar-DZ'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] as used in [[Algeria]]) may be better expressed as ''arq'' for [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian Spoken Arabic]].\n\n== Extensions ==\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2019}}\n''Extension subtags'' (not to be confused with ''extended language subtags'') allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language.

In particular, weaker members of the [[Qajar dynasty]] often did not rule much beyond the capital [[Tehran]], a fact exploited by the imperial powers Britain and [[Russia]] in the 19th century. For example, when British cartographers, diplomats, and telegraph workers traveled along Iran's southern coast in the early 19th century laden with guns and accompanied by powerful ships, some local chieftains quickly calculated that their sworn allegiance to the Shah in [[Tehran]] with its accompanying tax burden might be optional. When queried, they proclaimed their own local authority.<ref>\"Memorandum by the Rev.

According to [[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], in 1930s [[Reza Shah|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] pursued the official policy of [[Persianization]] to assimilate Azerbaijanis and other ethnic minorities in Iran:\n\n{{cquote|The steps that the Teheran regime took in the 1930s with the aim of Persianization of the Azeris and other minorities appeared to take a leaf from the writings of the reformist-minded intellectuals in the previous decade. In the quest of imposing national homogeneity on the country where half of the population consisted of ethnic minorities, the Pahlavi regime issued in quick succession bans on the use of Azeri on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and, finally, in the publication of books. Azeri was reduced to the status of a language that only could be spoken and hardly ever written. As the Persianization campaign gained momentum, it drew inspiration from the revivalist spirit of Zoroastrian national glories. There followed even more invasive official practices, such as changing Turkic-sounding geographic names and interference with giving children names other than Persian ones. While cultivating cordial relations with Kemalist Turkey, Reza Shah carried on a forceful de-Turkification campaign in Iran.<ref>Tadeusz Swietochowski, Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition. p.122, {{ISBN|0-231-07068-3}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Lois Beck in 1980:<ref>Lois Beck. \"Revolutionary Iran and Its Tribal Peoples\".\n''MERIP Reports, No. 87,'' (May, 1980), p. 16</ref>\n{{cquote|''Tribal populations, as well as all ethnic minorities in Iran, were denied many national rights under the Pahlavis and were victims of Persian chauvinism.

In particular, weaker members of the [[Qajar dynasty]] often did not rule much beyond the capital [[Tehran]], a fact exploited by the imperial powers Britain and [[Russia]] in the 19th century. For example, when British cartographers, diplomats, and telegraph workers traveled along Iran's southern coast in the early 19th century laden with guns and accompanied by powerful ships, some local chieftains quickly calculated that their sworn allegiance to the Shah in [[Tehran]] with its accompanying tax burden might be optional.

Azeri was reduced to the status of a language that only could be spoken and hardly ever written. As the Persianization campaign gained momentum, it drew inspiration from the revivalist spirit of Zoroastrian national glories.

It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and  kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Keenagh was one of these four polls.\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the farm, termons or hospitals of Tampleporte containing 4 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 10 shillings'' to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]].

It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief.
