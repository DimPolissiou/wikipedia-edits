In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five t seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>.\n\nThe 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\" /> The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=\"ABT1\">[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=\"Lightning\" />. The brigade entrenched and held this position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/> The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the campaign. }} \n\nDuring the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]|Tullahoma Campaign]], the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAt around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade and Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade. The attacking Confederates were surprised by the resolute, confident manner that the Lightning Brigade demonnstrated in driving them back.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five t seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>.\n\nThe 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\" /> The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=\"ABT1\">[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade entrenched and held this position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/> The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the campaign. }} \n\nDuring the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]|Tullahoma Campaign]], the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAt around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade and Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade. The attacking Confederates were surprised by the resolute, confident manner that the Lightning Brigade demonnstrated in driving them back.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers (since they physically burn the organic dye on write-once CD-R, DVD-R and BD-R discs). [[Compact disc]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[Blu-ray]] discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer drive, combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive, and DVD writer drive supporting certain recordable and rewritable DVD formats (such as DVD-R(W) only, DVD+R(W) only, DVD-RAM only, and all DVD formats except DVD-R DL). {{As of|2020}}, very commonly computers, escpecially laptops, do not include any optical drive (while can be had to plug in). Before DVD writer drive supporting all existing recordable and rewritable DVD and CD formats was the most common type. There are also the DVD-ROM drive (used on DVD players and some game consoles), BD-ROM drive (used on Blu-ray players and some game consoles), Blu-ray Disc combo (BD-ROM/DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW) drive, and Blu-ray Disc writer drive available.\n\nOptical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as [[CD player]]s, [[DVD player]]s, Blu-ray disc players, [[DVD recorder]]s, certain desktop video game consoles, such as [[Sony PlayStation 4]], [[Microsoft Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Wii U]], upcoming comsoles [[Sony PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox Series X]] and also in older consoles, [[Sony PlayStation 3]], and certain portable video game consoles, such as [[Sony PlayStation Portable]] (using proprietary now discontinued [[Universal Media Disc|UMDs]]). They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. [[Floppy disk drive]]s, with capacity of 1.44&nbsp;MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. [[USB flash drive]]s, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.\n\nDisc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances ([[film]]s, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g. a standard DVD holds 4.7&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.\n\nOptical discs are used to [[backup|back up]] relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, which {{As of|2015|lc=on}} typically contain many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical.

Computer case manufacturers also began to stop including 5.25-inch bays for installing optical disc drives. However, new optical disc drives are still (as of 2020) available for purchase. Notable optical disc drive OEMs include [[Hitachi]], [[LG Electronics]] (merged into [[Hitachi-LG Data Storage]]), [[Toshiba]], [[Samsung Electronics]] (merged into [[Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology]]), [[Sony]], [[NEC]] (merged into [[Optiarc]]), Lite-On, [[Philips]] (merged into [[Lite-On|Philips & Lite-On Digital Solutions]]), [[Pioneer Corporation]], [[Plextor]], [[Panasonic]], [[Yamaha Corporation]] and [[JVCKenwood|Kenwood]].<ref>https://www.cnet.com/news/optical-disc-drive-settlement-claim-sony-optiarc-nec-hitachi-lg-panasonic/</ref>\n\n== Key components ==\n\n=== Laser and optics ===\n[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|Pickup head]]\n[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|Pickup head, side view]]\n[[File:Detail of DVD-RW optics.png|thumb|Optical path]]\nThe most important  part of an optical disc drive is an ''optical path'', which is inside a ''pickup head'' (''PUH''). The PUH is also known as a laser pickup, optical pickup, pickup, pickup assembly, laser assembly, laser optical assembly, optical pickup head/unit or optical assembly.<ref name=dvd>{{Cite book |first1=Jim H. |last1=Taylor |first2=Mark R. |last2=Johnson |first3=Charles G. |last3=Crawford |title=DVD Demystified |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ikxuL2aX9cAC&pg=PT229 |pages=7\u20138 |isbn=0-07-142396-6}}</ref> It usually consists of a semiconductor [[laser diode]], a [[lens (optics)|lens]] for focusing the laser beam, and [[photodiode]]s  for detecting the light reflected from the disc's surface.<ref name=cd>{{Cite book |first=Sorin G. |last=Stan |title=The CD-ROM Drive: A Brief System Description |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gs3pdRb83VcC&pg=PA14 |page=13 |isbn=0-7923-8167-X}}</ref>\n\nInitially, CD-type lasers with a [[wavelength]] of 780&nbsp;nm (within the infrared) were used. For DVDs, the wavelength was reduced to 650&nbsp;nm (red color), and for Blu-ray Disc this was reduced even further to 405&nbsp;nm (violet color).\n\nTwo main [[servomechanism]]s are used, the first to maintain the proper distance between lens and disc, to ensure the laser beam is focused as a small ''laser spot'' on the disc. The second servo moves the pickup head along the disc's radius, keeping the beam on the ''track'', a continuous spiral data path. Optical disc media are 'read' beginning at the inner radius to the outer edge.\n\n[[File:Optical Disk Drive Sensor.jpeg|alt=The optical sensor out of a CD/DVD drive|thumb|The optical sensor out of a CD/DVD drive. The two larger rectangles are the photodiodes for pits, the inner one for land. This one also includes amplification and minor processing.]]\n\nOn ''read only media'' (ROM), during the manufacturing process the tracks are formed by pressing a thermoplastic resin into a nickel stamper that was made by plating a glass 'master' with raised 'bumps' on a flat surface, thus creating ''pits'' and ''lands'' in the plastic disk. Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser's wavelength, the reflected beam's phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing mutual destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that create corresponding electrical signals.\n\nAn optical disk recorder encodes (also known as burning, since the dye layer is permanentely burned) data onto a recordable [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], or [[BD-R]] disc (called a ''blank'') by selectively heating (burning) parts of an organic [[dye]] layer with a laser.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks that can be read like the pits and lands on pressed discs. For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 [[Watt|mW]], the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners' lasers often peak at about 200&nbsp;mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400&nbsp;mW before the diode fails.\n\nFor rewritable [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], or [[BD-RE]] media, the laser is used to melt a [[crystal]]line metal [[alloy]] in the recording layer of the disc.  Depending on the amount of power applied, the substance may be allowed to melt back (change the [[phase change disk|phase]] back) into crystalline form or left in an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] form, enabling marks of varying reflectivity to be created.\n\n''Double-sided'' media may be used, but they are not easily accessed with a standard drive, as they must be physically turned over to access the data on the other side.\n\n''Double layer'' (DL) media have two independent data layers separated by a semi-reflective layer. Both layers are accessible from the same side, but require the optics to change the laser's focus. Traditional ''single layer'' (SL) writable media are produced with a spiral groove molded in the protective [[polycarbonate]] layer (not in the data recording layer), to lead and synchronize the speed of recording head. Double-layered writable media have: a first polycarbonate layer with a (shallow) groove, a first data layer, a semi-reflective layer, a second (spacer) polycarbonate layer with another (deep) groove, and a second data layer. The first groove spiral usually starts on the inner edge and extends outwards, while the second groove starts on the outer edge and extends inwards.<ref>{{cite image|url=https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/589/original/doublelayer1.gif|title=Cross Section of DVD+R DL Optical Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite image|url=http://www.windowsusers.org/images/Dvd/R_dl.jpg|title=Cross Section of DVD+R DL Optical Media}}</ref>\n\nSome drives support [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[LightScribe]] photothermal printing technology for labeling specially coated discs.\n\n=== Rotational mechanism ===\n{{Further|Disk drive performance characteristics}}\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|left|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br ><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n[[File:CDRom.png|thumb|upright|A CD-ROM drive (without case)]]\n\nThe rotational mechanism in an optical drive differs considerably from that of a hard disk drive's, in that the latter keeps a [[constant angular velocity]] (CAV), in other words a constant number of [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM). With CAV, a higher [[throughput]] is generally achievable at the outer disc compared to the inner.\n\nOn the other hand, optical drives were developed with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 [[KiB]]/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend to require a constant [[bit rate]]. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of disc. This led to optical drives\u2014until recently\u2014operating with a [[constant linear velocity]] (CLV). The spiral ''groove'' of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200&nbsp;RPM on the outer rim and 500&nbsp;RPM on the inner.\n\nLater CD drives kept the CLV paradigm, but evolved to achieve higher rotational speeds, popularly described in multiples of a base speed. As a result, a 4\u00d7 drive, for instance, would rotate at 800-2000 RPM, while transferring data steadily at 600 KiB/s, which is equal to 4 \u00d7 150 KiB/s.\n\nFor DVDs, base or 1\u00d7 speed is 1.385&nbsp;MB/s, equal to 1.32&nbsp;MiB/s, approximately nine times faster than the CD base speed. For Blu-ray drives, base speed is 6.74&nbsp;MB/s, equal to 6.43&nbsp;MiB/s.\n\n[[File:Zone clv.jpg|thumb|The Z-CLV recording pattern is easily visible after burning a DVD-R.]]\n\nBecause keeping a constant transfer rate for the whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the [[zoned constant linear velocity]] (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at \"52\u00d7\", for example, would write at 20\u00d7 on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52\u00d7 at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Page | first = M. | title = Kenwood 72\u00d7 CD-ROM Review | page = 2 | url=http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=339&page=2 | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.\n\n[[File:Exploded CD 04.JPG|thumb|left|An exploded disc]]\n\n==== Limit ====\nBoth DVDs and CDs have been known to explode<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Spinning out of control: Risk of CD explosion |first=Brad |last=Spurgeon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-ptcd_ed3_.html? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325152833/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-ptcd_ed3_.html |archivedate=March 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> when damaged or spun at excessive speed. This imposes a constraint on the maximum speed (56\u00d7 for CDs or around 18\u00d7 in the case of DVDs) at which drives can operate.\n\n=== Loading mechanisms ===\n<!-- File gone: [[File:Plextor PX-W8432Ti - opening tray manually.webm|thumb|Opening the tray of a CD-RW manually with the help of a paper clip]] -->\nCurrent optical drives use either a ''tray-loading'' mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a motorized or manually operated tray, or a ''slot-loading'' mechanism, where the disc is slid into a slot and drawn in by motorized rollers. With both types of mechanisms, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive. However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a straightened paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tenpire.com/guide-for-different-types-of-optical-drives/ |title=Guide For Different Types Of Optical Drives |publisher=Tenpire |accessdate=2019-06-12}}</ref> Slot-loading optical disc drives have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller [[miniDVD|80 mm discs]] (unless 80&nbsp;mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or eject button, and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally.  However, the Nintendo [[Wii]], because of [[backward compatibility]] with [[Nintendo GameCube]] games,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/gi_system.jsp?menu=console&submenu=rvl-gi-sys-diff |title=&#124; Wii - General Information: System & Accessories |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> and [[PlayStation 3]]<ref>{{Cite book | title = PlayStation 3 Instruction Manual | page = 50 | url = http://www.playstation.com/manual/pdf/CECH-2001A_2001B-2.85_2.pdf | accessdate = 2012-11-12}}</ref> video game consoles are able to load standard size DVDs and 80&nbsp;mm discs in the same slot-loading drive.\n\nA small number of drive models, mostly compact portable units, have a ''top-loading'' mechanism where the drive lid is opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = TEAC | title = CD-210PU USB interface portable CD-ROM drive | url=http://www.teac.co.jp/dspd/product/optical/cd-210pu.html | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, most portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders feature top-loading drives). These sometimes have the advantage of using spring-loaded ball bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.\n\nSome early CD-ROM drives used a mechanism where CDs had to be inserted into special cartridges or [[Caddy (hardware)|caddies]], somewhat similar in appearance to a [[Floppy drive#{{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk|3\u00bd-inch micro floppy diskette]]. This was intended to protect the disc from accidental damage by enclosing it in a tougher plastic casing, but did not gain wide acceptance due to the additional cost and compatibility concerns\u2014such drives would also inconveniently require \"bare\" discs to be manually inserted into an openable caddy before use.  [[Ultra Density Optical]] and [[Universal Media Disc]] (UMD) use optical disc cartridges.\n\nThere were also some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading mechanism will eject slightly and user has to pull out the tray manually to load CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have spring-loaded ball bearings on the spindle.\n\n=== Computer interfaces ===\n[[Image:Dvd backside.jpg|right|thumb|Digital audio output, analog audio output, and parallel ATA interface]]\nMost internal drives for [[personal computer]]s, [[Server (computing)|server]]s, and [[workstation]]s are designed to fit in a standard 5.25-inch [[drive bay]] and connect to their host via an [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] or [[SATA]] interface. Additionally, there may be digital and analog outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard. At one time, computer software resembling [[CD player]]s controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is [[CD ripping|extracted]] from the disc as data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.\n\nExternal drives usually have [[USB]] or [[FireWire]] interfaces.  Some portable versions for laptops power themselves from batteries or directly from their interface bus.\n\nDrives with [[SCSI]] interface were made, but they are less common and tend to be more expensive, because of the cost of their interface chipsets, more complex SCSI connectors, and small volume of sales.\n\nWhen the optical disc drive was first developed, it was not easy to add to computer systems. Some computers such as the IBM PS/2 were standardizing on the 3\u00bd-inch floppy and 3\u00bd-inch hard disk and did not include a place for a large internal device. Also IBM PCs and clones at first only included a single (parallel) [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] drive interface, which by the time the CDROM was introduced, was already being used to support two hard drives. Early laptops simply had no built-in high-speed interface for supporting an external storage device.\n\n[[Image:HP C4381A CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series-4077.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] C4381A CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series'', showing parallel ports to connect between a printer and the computer]] This was solved through several techniques:\n\n* Early [[sound cards]] could include a CD-ROM drive interface.  Initially, such interfaces were proprietary to each CD-ROM manufacturer.  A sound card could often have two or three different interfaces which are able to communicate with cdrom drive.\n* A [[parallel port]] external drive was developed that connected a printer and the computer. This was slow but an option for laptops.\n* A [[PCMCIA]] optical drive interface was also developed for laptops.\n* A SCSI card could be installed in desktop PCs for an external SCSI drive enclosure, though SCSI was typically much more expensive than other options.\n\n=== Internal mechanism of a drive ===\n[[File:Dismdvd.jpg|thumb|right|Internal mechanism of a DVD-ROM Drive. See text for details.]]\n\nThe optical drives in the photos are shown right side up; the disc would sit on top of them. The laser and optical system scans the underside of the disc.\n\nWith reference to the top photo, just to the right of image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it's not in the photo. After the disc tray stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet near the top of the rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an \"outrunner\"-style [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] which has an external rotor \u2013 every visible part of it spins.\n\nTwo parallel guide rods that run between upper left and lower right in the photo carry the \"[[sled]]\", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this \"sled\" is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes at the edge of the disc. To move the \"sled\" during continuous read or write operations, a [[stepper motor]] rotates a leadscrew to move the \"sled\" throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. The leadscrew is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the \"sled\".\n\nIn contrast, the mechanism shown in the second photo, which comes from a cheaply made DVD player, uses less accurate and less efficient brushed [[DC motor]]s to both move the sled and spin the disc. Some older drives use a DC motor to move the sled, but also have a magnetic [[rotary encoder]] to keep track of the position. Most drives in computers use stepper motors.\n\nThe gray metal chassis is shock-mounted at its four corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, and to reduce drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).\n\nIn the third photo, the components under the cover of the lens mechanism are visible. The two permanent magnets on either side of the lens holder as well as the coils that move the lens can be seen. This allows the lens to be moved up, down, forwards, and backwards to stabilize the focus of the beam.\n\nIn the fourth photo, the inside of the optics package can be seen. Note that since this is a CD-ROM drive, there is only one laser, which is the black component mounted to the bottom left of the assembly. Just above the laser are the first focusing lens and prism that direct the beam at the disc. The tall, thin object in the center is a half-silvered [[mirror]] that splits the laser beam in multiple directions. To the bottom right of the mirror is the main [[photodiode]] that senses the beam reflected off the disc. Above the main photodiode is a second photodiode that is used to sense and regulate the power of the laser.\n\nThe irregular orange material is flexible etched copper foil supported by thin sheet plastic; these are \"flexible printed circuits\" that connect everything to the electronics (which is not shown).\n\n== Compatibility ==\nMost optical drives are backward compatible with their ancestors up to CD, although this is not required by standards.\n\nCompared to a CD's 1.2&nbsp;mm layer of polycarbonate, a DVD's laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6&nbsp;mm in order to reach the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser.  With the newer Blu-ray disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1&nbsp;mm of material.  Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater focus range.  In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.\n<!-- Table requires an extra column for DVD-R DL media --->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Optical disc drive\n! colspan=16 | Optical disc or optical media\n|-\n!

In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40\u00d7/16\u00d7/48\u00d7 CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40\u00d7 (6,000 kbit/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16\u00d7 (2,400 kbit/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48\u00d7 (7,200 kbit/s).\n\nDuring the times of [[combo drive|combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drives]], an additional speed rating (e.g. the 16\u00d7 in 52\u00d7/32\u00d7/52\u00d7/16\u00d7) is designated for DVD-ROM media reading operations.\n\nFor DVD writer drives, Blu-ray disc combo drives, and Blu-ray disc writer drives, the writing and reading speed of their respective optical media are specified in its retail box, user's manual, or bundled brochures or pamphlets.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[buffer underrun|''buffer underruns'']] became a very common problem as high-speed CD recorders began to appear in home and office computers, which\u2014for a variety of reasons\u2014often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed. The recorder, should it run short, would be forced to halt the recording process, leaving a truncated track that usually renders the disc useless.\n\nIn response, manufacturers of CD recorders began shipping drives with \"buffer underrun protection\" (under various trade names, such as [[Sanyo]]'s [[burn proof|\"BURN-Proof\"]], [[Ricoh]]'s \"JustLink\" and [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]]'s \"Lossless Link\"). These can suspend and resume the recording process in such a way that the gap the stoppage produces can be dealt with by the [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction|error-correcting]] logic built into CD players and CD-ROM drives.  The first of these drives were rated at 12\u00d7 and 16\u00d7.\n\nWhile drives are burning DVD+R, DVD+RW and all Blu-ray formats, they do not require any such error correcting recovery as the recorder is able to place the new data exactly on the end of the suspended write effectively producing a continuous track (this is what the DVD+ technology achieved).  Although later interfaces were able to stream data at the required speed, many drives now write in a '[[zoned constant linear velocity]]'.  This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained.  This is handled in the same manner as a buffer underrun.\n\nThe internal buffer of optical disc writer drives is: 8 MiB or 4 MiB when recording BD-R, BD-R DL, BD-RE, or BD-RE DL media; 2 MiB when recording DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-R DL, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+RW DL, DVD-RAM, CD-R, or CD-RW media.\n\n== Recording schemes ==\n{{See also|Optical disc recording technologies}}\n\nCD recording on personal computers was originally a batch-oriented task in that it required specialised [[optical disc authoring software|authoring software]] to create an \"[[disc image|image]]\" of the data to record and to record it to disc in the one session. This was acceptable for archival purposes, but limited the general convenience of CD-R and CD-RW discs as a [[removable media|removable storage medium]].\n\n[[Packet writing]] is a scheme in which the recorder writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be ''closed'' at any time by writing a final table-of-contents to the start of the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the [[operating system]] and a [[file system]] like [[Universal Disc Format|UDF]], can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.\n\nFixed-length packet writing (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the capacity of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours.  These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is.  Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers.  The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block.  Although generous gaps (the padding referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.\n\nThe DVD+RW disc format eliminates this unreliability by embedding more accurate timing hints in the data groove of the disc and allowing individual data blocks (or even bytes) to be replaced without affecting backward compatibility (a feature dubbed \"lossless linking\"). The format itself was designed to deal with discontinuous recording because it was expected to be widely used in [[digital video recorder]]s.  Many such DVRs use variable-rate video compression schemes which require them to record in short bursts; some allow simultaneous playback and recording by alternating quickly between recording to the tail of the disc whilst reading from elsewhere.  The Blu-ray disc system also encompasses this technology.\n\n[[Mount Rainier (packet writing)|Mount Rainier]] aims to make packet-written CD-RW and DVD+RW discs as convenient to use as that of removable magnetic media by having the firmware format new discs in the background and manage media defects (by automatically mapping parts of the disc which have been worn out by erase cycles to reserve space elsewhere on the disc).  As of February 2007, support for Mount Rainier is natively supported in [[Windows Vista]].  All previous versions of Windows require a third-party solution, as does [[Mac OS X]].\n\n=== Recorder Unique Identifier ===\nOwing to pressure from the music industry, as represented by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] and [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], [[Philips]] developed the ''Recorder Identification Code'' (RID) to allow media to be uniquely associated with the recorder that has written it. This standard is contained in the [[Rainbow Books]]. The RID-Code consists of a supplier code (e.g. \"PHI\" for Philips), a model number and the unique ID of the recorder. Quoting Philips, the RID \"enables a trace for each disc back to the exact machine on which it was made using coded information in the recording itself. The use of the RID code is mandatory.\"<ref name=\"Philips\">{{cite web | publisher = Philips | title = Intellectual Property & Standards/Licensing Programs | url=https://www.ip.philips.com/services/?module=IpsLicenseProgram&command=Print&id=20 | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the RID was introduced for music and video industry purposes, the RID is included on every disc written by every drive, including data and backup discs.  The value of the RID is questionable as it is (currently) impossible to locate any individual recorder due to there being no database.\n\n=== Source Identification Code ===\nThe Source Identification Code (SID) is an eight character supplier code that is placed on optical discs by the manufacturer. The SID identifies not only manufacturer, but also the individual factory and machine that produced the disc.\n\nAccording to Phillips, the administrator of the SID codes, the SID code provides an optical disc production facility with the means to identify all discs mastered or replicated in its plant, including the specific Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or disc.<ref name=\"Philips\" />\n\n=== Use of RID and SID together in forensics ===\nThe standard use of RID and SID mean that each disc written contains a record of the machine that produced a disc (the SID), and which drive wrote it (the RID). This combined knowledge may be very useful to law enforcement, to investigative agencies, and to private or corporate investigators.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = International Federation of the Phonographic Industry | title = Pocket guide to recognising pirate music products | url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/manual-of-guidance-chap3-english.pdf | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Computer hardware]]\n* [[Cue sheet (music software)]]\n* [[Floptical]]\n* [[ISO image]]\n* [[List of optical disc authoring software]]\n* [[MultiLevel Recording]]\n* [[Optical disc authoring]]\n* [[Optical disc recording technologies]]\n* [[Optical jukebox]]\n* [[Phase-change Dual]]\n* [[Receiver (radio)]]\n* [[Ripping]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{HowStuffWorks|cd-burner|How CDs Work}}\n* {{HowStuffWorks|cd-burner|How CD Burners Work}}\n* [http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa.htm Understanding CD-R & CD-RW]\n\n{{Basic computer components}}\n\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Audio storage]]\n[[Category:Optical computer storage]]\n[[Category:Optoelectronics|Disc drive]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n[[Category:Video storage]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Sony-Internal-PC-DVD-Drive-Opened.jpg|thumb|A CD/DVD-ROM computer drive]]\n[[File:Apple-USB-SuperDrive.jpg|thumb|An external [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] USB [[SuperDrive]]]]\n[[File:Internal optical drive.JPG|thumb|A removable internal [[Lenovo]] disc drive]]\n{{Optical disc authoring}}\n{{Short description|Computer component used to read and write data from and to optical discs}}\n[[File:Optical drive lens.JPG|thumb|The CD/DVD drive lens on an Acer laptop]]\n[[File:BluRayLaser.JPG|thumb|Lenses from a Blu-ray writer in a Sony Vaio E series laptop]]\n\nIn [[computing]], an '''optical disc drive''' ('''ODD''') is a [[disk drive|disc drive]] that uses [[laser]] light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible [[light spectrum]] as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from [[optical disc]]s. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers (since they physically burn the organic dye on write-once CD-R, DVD-R and BD-R discs). [[Compact disc]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[Blu-ray]] discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer drive, combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive, and DVD writer drive supporting certain recordable and rewritable DVD formats (such as DVD-R(W) only, DVD+R(W) only, DVD-RAM only, and all DVD formats except DVD-R DL). {{As of|2020}}, very commonly computers, escpecially laptops, do not include any optical drive (while can be had to plug in). Before DVD writer drive supporting all existing recordable and rewritable DVD and CD formats was the most common type. There are also the DVD-ROM drive (used on DVD players and some game consoles), BD-ROM drive (used on Blu-ray players and some game consoles), Blu-ray Disc combo (BD-ROM/DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW) drive, and Blu-ray Disc writer drive available.\n\nOptical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as [[CD player]]s, [[DVD player]]s, Blu-ray disc players, [[DVD recorder]]s, certain desktop video game consoles, such as [[Sony PlayStation 4]], [[Microsoft Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Wii U]], upcoming comsoles [[Sony PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox Series X]] and also in older consoles, [[Sony PlayStation 3]], and certain portable video game consoles, such as [[Sony PlayStation Portable]] (using proprietary now discontinued [[Universal Media Disc|UMDs]]). They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. [[Floppy disk drive]]s, with capacity of 1.44&nbsp;MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. [[USB flash drive]]s, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.\n\nDisc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances ([[film]]s, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g. a standard DVD holds 4.7&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.\n\nOptical discs are used to [[backup|back up]] relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, which {{As of|2015|lc=on}} typically contain many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical. Large backups are often instead made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable; in professional environments magnetic [[tape drive]]s are also used.\n\n== History ==\nThe first laser disc, demonstrated in 1972, was the [[LaserDisc|''Laservision'' 12-inch video disc]]. The video signal was stored as an analog format like a video cassette. The first digitally recorded optical disc was a 5-inch audio [[compact disc]] (CD) in a read-only format created by [[Sony]] and Philips in 1975.<ref name=\"lintech\" />\n\nThe first erasable optical disc drives were announced in 1983, by [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (Panasonic),<ref name=\"Lasers & Optronics, Volume 6\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XNxCAQAAIAAJ ''Lasers & Optronics'', Volume 6], page 77</ref> Sony, and [[KDDI|Kokusai Denshin Denwa]] (KDDI).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pmWoDGkrQJsC&pg=PA30 ''Computerworld'', September 19, 1983, page 30]</ref> Sony eventually released the first commercial erasable and rewritable 5.25-inch optical disc drive in 1987,<ref name=\"lintech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lintech.org/comp-per/12OPDISK.pdf |title=Computer Peripherals - Chapter 12.

Computer case manufacturers also began to stop including 5.25-inch bays for installing optical disc drives. However, new optical disc drives are still (as of 2020) available for purchase. Notable optical disc drive OEMs include [[Hitachi]], [[LG Electronics]] (merged into [[Hitachi-LG Data Storage]]), [[Toshiba]], [[Samsung Electronics]] (merged into [[Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology]]), [[Sony]], [[NEC]] (merged into [[Optiarc]]), Lite-On, [[Philips]] (merged into [[Lite-On|Philips & Lite-On Digital Solutions]]), [[Pioneer Corporation]], [[Plextor]], [[Panasonic]], [[Yamaha Corporation]] and [[JVCKenwood|Kenwood]].<ref>https://www.cnet.com/news/optical-disc-drive-settlement-claim-sony-optiarc-nec-hitachi-lg-panasonic/</ref>\n\n== Key components ==\n\n=== Laser and optics ===\n[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|Pickup head]]\n[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|Pickup head, side view]]\n[[File:Detail of DVD-RW optics.png|thumb|Optical path]]\nThe most important  part of an optical disc drive is an ''optical path'', which is inside a ''pickup head'' (''PUH''). The PUH is also known as a laser pickup, optical pickup, pickup, pickup assembly, laser assembly, laser optical assembly, optical pickup head/unit or optical assembly.<ref name=dvd>{{Cite book |first1=Jim H. |last1=Taylor |first2=Mark R. |last2=Johnson |first3=Charles G. |last3=Crawford |title=DVD Demystified |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ikxuL2aX9cAC&pg=PT229 |pages=7\u20138 |isbn=0-07-142396-6}}</ref> It usually consists of a semiconductor [[laser diode]], a [[lens (optics)|lens]] for focusing the laser beam, and [[photodiode]]s  for detecting the light reflected from the disc's surface.<ref name=cd>{{Cite book |first=Sorin G. |last=Stan |title=The CD-ROM Drive: A Brief System Description |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gs3pdRb83VcC&pg=PA14 |page=13 |isbn=0-7923-8167-X}}</ref>\n\nInitially, CD-type lasers with a [[wavelength]] of 780&nbsp;nm (within the infrared) were used. For DVDs, the wavelength was reduced to 650&nbsp;nm (red color), and for Blu-ray Disc this was reduced even further to 405&nbsp;nm (violet color).\n\nTwo main [[servomechanism]]s are used, the first to maintain the proper distance between lens and disc, to ensure the laser beam is focused as a small ''laser spot'' on the disc. The second servo moves the pickup head along the disc's radius, keeping the beam on the ''track'', a continuous spiral data path. Optical disc media are 'read' beginning at the inner radius to the outer edge.\n\n[[File:Optical Disk Drive Sensor.jpeg|alt=The optical sensor out of a CD/DVD drive|thumb|The optical sensor out of a CD/DVD drive. The two larger rectangles are the photodiodes for pits, the inner one for land. This one also includes amplification and minor processing.]]\n\nOn ''read only media'' (ROM), during the manufacturing process the tracks are formed by pressing a thermoplastic resin into a nickel stamper that was made by plating a glass 'master' with raised 'bumps' on a flat surface, thus creating ''pits'' and ''lands'' in the plastic disk. Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser's wavelength, the reflected beam's phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing mutual destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that create corresponding electrical signals.\n\nAn optical disk recorder encodes (also known as burning, since the dye layer is permanentely burned) data onto a recordable [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], or [[BD-R]] disc (called a ''blank'') by selectively heating (burning) parts of an organic [[dye]] layer with a laser.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks that can be read like the pits and lands on pressed discs. For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 [[Watt|mW]], the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners' lasers often peak at about 200&nbsp;mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400&nbsp;mW before the diode fails.\n\nFor rewritable [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], or [[BD-RE]] media, the laser is used to melt a [[crystal]]line metal [[alloy]] in the recording layer of the disc.  Depending on the amount of power applied, the substance may be allowed to melt back (change the [[phase change disk|phase]] back) into crystalline form or left in an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] form, enabling marks of varying reflectivity to be created.\n\n''Double-sided'' media may be used, but they are not easily accessed with a standard drive, as they must be physically turned over to access the data on the other side.\n\n''Double layer'' (DL) media have two independent data layers separated by a semi-reflective layer. Both layers are accessible from the same side, but require the optics to change the laser's focus. Traditional ''single layer'' (SL) writable media are produced with a spiral groove molded in the protective [[polycarbonate]] layer (not in the data recording layer), to lead and synchronize the speed of recording head. Double-layered writable media have: a first polycarbonate layer with a (shallow) groove, a first data layer, a semi-reflective layer, a second (spacer) polycarbonate layer with another (deep) groove, and a second data layer. The first groove spiral usually starts on the inner edge and extends outwards, while the second groove starts on the outer edge and extends inwards.<ref>{{cite image|url=https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/589/original/doublelayer1.gif|title=Cross Section of DVD+R DL Optical Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite image|url=http://www.windowsusers.org/images/Dvd/R_dl.jpg|title=Cross Section of DVD+R DL Optical Media}}</ref>\n\nSome drives support [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[LightScribe]] photothermal printing technology for labeling specially coated discs.\n\n=== Rotational mechanism ===\n{{Further|Disk drive performance characteristics}}\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|left|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br ><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n[[File:CDRom.png|thumb|upright|A CD-ROM drive (without case)]]\n\nThe rotational mechanism in an optical drive differs considerably from that of a hard disk drive's, in that the latter keeps a [[constant angular velocity]] (CAV), in other words a constant number of [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM). With CAV, a higher [[throughput]] is generally achievable at the outer disc compared to the inner.\n\nOn the other hand, optical drives were developed with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 [[KiB]]/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend to require a constant [[bit rate]]. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of disc. This led to optical drives\u2014until recently\u2014operating with a [[constant linear velocity]] (CLV). The spiral ''groove'' of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200&nbsp;RPM on the outer rim and 500&nbsp;RPM on the inner.\n\nLater CD drives kept the CLV paradigm, but evolved to achieve higher rotational speeds, popularly described in multiples of a base speed. As a result, a 4\u00d7 drive, for instance, would rotate at 800-2000 RPM, while transferring data steadily at 600 KiB/s, which is equal to 4 \u00d7 150 KiB/s.\n\nFor DVDs, base or 1\u00d7 speed is 1.385&nbsp;MB/s, equal to 1.32&nbsp;MiB/s, approximately nine times faster than the CD base speed. For Blu-ray drives, base speed is 6.74&nbsp;MB/s, equal to 6.43&nbsp;MiB/s.\n\n[[File:Zone clv.jpg|thumb|The Z-CLV recording pattern is easily visible after burning a DVD-R.]]\n\nBecause keeping a constant transfer rate for the whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the [[zoned constant linear velocity]] (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at \"52\u00d7\", for example, would write at 20\u00d7 on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52\u00d7 at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Page | first = M. | title = Kenwood 72\u00d7 CD-ROM Review | page = 2 | url=http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=339&page=2 | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.\n\n[[File:Exploded CD 04.JPG|thumb|left|An exploded disc]]\n\n==== Limit ====\nBoth DVDs and CDs have been known to explode<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Spinning out of control: Risk of CD explosion |first=Brad |last=Spurgeon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-ptcd_ed3_.html? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325152833/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-ptcd_ed3_.html |archivedate=March 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> when damaged or spun at excessive speed. This imposes a constraint on the maximum speed (56\u00d7 for CDs or around 18\u00d7 in the case of DVDs) at which drives can operate.\n\n=== Loading mechanisms ===\n<!-- File gone: [[File:Plextor PX-W8432Ti - opening tray manually.webm|thumb|Opening the tray of a CD-RW manually with the help of a paper clip]] -->\nCurrent optical drives use either a ''tray-loading'' mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a motorized or manually operated tray, or a ''slot-loading'' mechanism, where the disc is slid into a slot and drawn in by motorized rollers. With both types of mechanisms, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive. However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a straightened paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tenpire.com/guide-for-different-types-of-optical-drives/ |title=Guide For Different Types Of Optical Drives |publisher=Tenpire |accessdate=2019-06-12}}</ref> Slot-loading optical disc drives have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller [[miniDVD|80 mm discs]] (unless 80&nbsp;mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or eject button, and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally.  However, the Nintendo [[Wii]], because of [[backward compatibility]] with [[Nintendo GameCube]] games,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/gi_system.jsp?menu=console&submenu=rvl-gi-sys-diff |title=&#124; Wii - General Information: System & Accessories |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> and [[PlayStation 3]]<ref>{{Cite book | title = PlayStation 3 Instruction Manual | page = 50 | url = http://www.playstation.com/manual/pdf/CECH-2001A_2001B-2.85_2.pdf | accessdate = 2012-11-12}}</ref> video game consoles are able to load standard size DVDs and 80&nbsp;mm discs in the same slot-loading drive.\n\nA small number of drive models, mostly compact portable units, have a ''top-loading'' mechanism where the drive lid is opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = TEAC | title = CD-210PU USB interface portable CD-ROM drive | url=http://www.teac.co.jp/dspd/product/optical/cd-210pu.html | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, most portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders feature top-loading drives). These sometimes have the advantage of using spring-loaded ball bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.\n\nSome early CD-ROM drives used a mechanism where CDs had to be inserted into special cartridges or [[Caddy (hardware)|caddies]], somewhat similar in appearance to a 3\u00bd-inch [[Floppy drive#The 3\u00bd-inch micro floppy diskette|floppy diskette]]. This was intended to protect the disc from accidental damage by enclosing it in a tougher plastic casing, but did not gain wide acceptance due to the additional cost and compatibility concerns\u2014such drives would also inconveniently require \"bare\" discs to be manually inserted into an openable caddy before use.  [[Ultra Density Optical]] and [[Universal Media Disc]] (UMD) use optical disc cartridges.\n\nThere were also some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading mechanism will eject slightly and user has to pull out the tray manually to load CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have spring-loaded ball bearings on the spindle.\n\n=== Computer interfaces ===\n[[Image:Dvd backside.jpg|right|thumb|Digital audio output, analog audio output, and parallel ATA interface]]\nMost internal drives for [[personal computer]]s, [[Server (computing)|server]]s, and [[workstation]]s are designed to fit in a standard 5.25-inch [[drive bay]] and connect to their host via an [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] or [[SATA]] interface. Additionally, there may be digital and analog outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard. At one time, computer software resembling [[CD player]]s controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is [[CD ripping|extracted]] from the disc as data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.\n\nExternal drives usually have [[USB]] or [[FireWire]] interfaces.  Some portable versions for laptops power themselves from batteries or directly from their interface bus.\n\nDrives with [[SCSI]] interface were made, but they are less common and tend to be more expensive, because of the cost of their interface chipsets, more complex SCSI connectors, and small volume of sales.\n\nWhen the optical disc drive was first developed, it was not easy to add to computer systems. Some computers such as the IBM PS/2 were standardizing on the 3\u00bd-inch floppy and 3\u00bd-inch hard disk and did not include a place for a large internal device. Also IBM PCs and clones at first only included a single (parallel) [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] drive interface, which by the time the CDROM was introduced, was already being used to support two hard drives. Early laptops simply had no built-in high-speed interface for supporting an external storage device.\n\n[[Image:HP C4381A CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series-4077.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] C4381A CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series'', showing parallel ports to connect between a printer and the computer]] This was solved through several techniques:\n\n* Early [[sound cards]] could include a CD-ROM drive interface.  Initially, such interfaces were proprietary to each CD-ROM manufacturer.  A sound card could often have two or three different interfaces which are able to communicate with cdrom drive.\n* A [[parallel port]] external drive was developed that connected a printer and the computer. This was slow but an option for laptops.\n* A [[PCMCIA]] optical drive interface was also developed for laptops.\n* A SCSI card could be installed in desktop PCs for an external SCSI drive enclosure, though SCSI was typically much more expensive than other options.\n\n=== Internal mechanism of a drive ===\n[[File:Dismdvd.jpg|thumb|right|Internal mechanism of a DVD-ROM Drive. See text for details.]]\n\nThe optical drives in the photos are shown right side up; the disc would sit on top of them. The laser and optical system scans the underside of the disc.\n\nWith reference to the top photo, just to the right of image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it's not in the photo. After the disc tray stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet near the top of the rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an \"outrunner\"-style [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] which has an external rotor \u2013 every visible part of it spins.\n\nTwo parallel guide rods that run between upper left and lower right in the photo carry the \"[[sled]]\", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this \"sled\" is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes at the edge of the disc. To move the \"sled\" during continuous read or write operations, a [[stepper motor]] rotates a leadscrew to move the \"sled\" throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. The leadscrew is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the \"sled\".\n\nIn contrast, the mechanism shown in the second photo, which comes from a cheaply made DVD player, uses less accurate and less efficient brushed [[DC motor]]s to both move the sled and spin the disc. Some older drives use a DC motor to move the sled, but also have a magnetic [[rotary encoder]] to keep track of the position. Most drives in computers use stepper motors.\n\nThe gray metal chassis is shock-mounted at its four corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, and to reduce drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).\n\nIn the third photo, the components under the cover of the lens mechanism are visible. The two permanent magnets on either side of the lens holder as well as the coils that move the lens can be seen. This allows the lens to be moved up, down, forwards, and backwards to stabilize the focus of the beam.\n\nIn the fourth photo, the inside of the optics package can be seen. Note that since this is a CD-ROM drive, there is only one laser, which is the black component mounted to the bottom left of the assembly. Just above the laser are the first focusing lens and prism that direct the beam at the disc. The tall, thin object in the center is a half-silvered [[mirror]] that splits the laser beam in multiple directions. To the bottom right of the mirror is the main [[photodiode]] that senses the beam reflected off the disc. Above the main photodiode is a second photodiode that is used to sense and regulate the power of the laser.\n\nThe irregular orange material is flexible etched copper foil supported by thin sheet plastic; these are \"flexible printed circuits\" that connect everything to the electronics (which is not shown).\n\n== Compatibility ==\nMost optical drives are backward compatible with their ancestors up to CD, although this is not required by standards.\n\nCompared to a CD's 1.2&nbsp;mm layer of polycarbonate, a DVD's laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6&nbsp;mm in order to reach the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser.  With the newer Blu-ray disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1&nbsp;mm of material.  Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater focus range.  In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.\n<!-- Table requires an extra column for DVD-R DL media --->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Optical disc drive\n! colspan=16 | Optical disc or optical media\n|-\n!

In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40\u00d7/16\u00d7/48\u00d7 CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40\u00d7 (6,000 kbit/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16\u00d7 (2,400 kbit/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48\u00d7 (7,200 kbit/s).\n\nDuring the times of [[combo drive|combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drives]], an additional speed rating (e.g. the 16\u00d7 in 52\u00d7/32\u00d7/52\u00d7/16\u00d7) is designated for DVD-ROM media reading operations.\n\nFor DVD writer drives, Blu-ray disc combo drives, and Blu-ray disc writer drives, the writing and reading speed of their respective optical media are specified in its retail box, user's manual, or bundled brochures or pamphlets.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[buffer underrun|''buffer underruns'']] became a very common problem as high-speed CD recorders began to appear in home and office computers, which\u2014for a variety of reasons\u2014often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed. The recorder, should it run short, would be forced to halt the recording process, leaving a truncated track that usually renders the disc useless.\n\nIn response, manufacturers of CD recorders began shipping drives with \"buffer underrun protection\" (under various trade names, such as [[Sanyo]]'s [[burn proof|\"BURN-Proof\"]], [[Ricoh]]'s \"JustLink\" and [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]]'s \"Lossless Link\"). These can suspend and resume the recording process in such a way that the gap the stoppage produces can be dealt with by the [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction|error-correcting]] logic built into CD players and CD-ROM drives.  The first of these drives were rated at 12\u00d7 and 16\u00d7.\n\nWhile drives are burning DVD+R, DVD+RW and all Blu-ray formats, they do not require any such error correcting recovery as the recorder is able to place the new data exactly on the end of the suspended write effectively producing a continuous track (this is what the DVD+ technology achieved).  Although later interfaces were able to stream data at the required speed, many drives now write in a '[[zoned constant linear velocity]]'.  This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained.  This is handled in the same manner as a buffer underrun.\n\nThe internal buffer of optical disc writer drives is: 8 MiB or 4 MiB when recording BD-R, BD-R DL, BD-RE, or BD-RE DL media; 2 MiB when recording DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-R DL, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+RW DL, DVD-RAM, CD-R, or CD-RW media.\n\n== Recording schemes ==\n{{See also|Optical disc recording technologies}}\n\nCD recording on personal computers was originally a batch-oriented task in that it required specialised [[optical disc authoring software|authoring software]] to create an \"[[disc image|image]]\" of the data to record and to record it to disc in the one session. This was acceptable for archival purposes, but limited the general convenience of CD-R and CD-RW discs as a [[removable media|removable storage medium]].\n\n[[Packet writing]] is a scheme in which the recorder writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be ''closed'' at any time by writing a final table-of-contents to the start of the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the [[operating system]] and a [[file system]] like [[Universal Disc Format|UDF]], can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.\n\nFixed-length packet writing (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the capacity of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours.  These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is.  Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers.  The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block.  Although generous gaps (the padding referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.\n\nThe DVD+RW disc format eliminates this unreliability by embedding more accurate timing hints in the data groove of the disc and allowing individual data blocks (or even bytes) to be replaced without affecting backward compatibility (a feature dubbed \"lossless linking\"). The format itself was designed to deal with discontinuous recording because it was expected to be widely used in [[digital video recorder]]s.  Many such DVRs use variable-rate video compression schemes which require them to record in short bursts; some allow simultaneous playback and recording by alternating quickly between recording to the tail of the disc whilst reading from elsewhere.  The Blu-ray disc system also encompasses this technology.\n\n[[Mount Rainier (packet writing)|Mount Rainier]] aims to make packet-written CD-RW and DVD+RW discs as convenient to use as that of removable magnetic media by having the firmware format new discs in the background and manage media defects (by automatically mapping parts of the disc which have been worn out by erase cycles to reserve space elsewhere on the disc).  As of February 2007, support for Mount Rainier is natively supported in [[Windows Vista]].  All previous versions of Windows require a third-party solution, as does [[Mac OS X]].\n\n=== Recorder Unique Identifier ===\nOwing to pressure from the music industry, as represented by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] and [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], [[Philips]] developed the ''Recorder Identification Code'' (RID) to allow media to be uniquely associated with the recorder that has written it. This standard is contained in the [[Rainbow Books]]. The RID-Code consists of a supplier code (e.g. \"PHI\" for Philips), a model number and the unique ID of the recorder. Quoting Philips, the RID \"enables a trace for each disc back to the exact machine on which it was made using coded information in the recording itself. The use of the RID code is mandatory.\"<ref name=\"Philips\">{{cite web | publisher = Philips | title = Intellectual Property & Standards/Licensing Programs | url=https://www.ip.philips.com/services/?module=IpsLicenseProgram&command=Print&id=20 | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the RID was introduced for music and video industry purposes, the RID is included on every disc written by every drive, including data and backup discs.  The value of the RID is questionable as it is (currently) impossible to locate any individual recorder due to there being no database.\n\n=== Source Identification Code ===\nThe Source Identification Code (SID) is an eight character supplier code that is placed on optical discs by the manufacturer. The SID identifies not only manufacturer, but also the individual factory and machine that produced the disc.\n\nAccording to Phillips, the administrator of the SID codes, the SID code provides an optical disc production facility with the means to identify all discs mastered or replicated in its plant, including the specific Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or disc.<ref name=\"Philips\" />\n\n=== Use of RID and SID together in forensics ===\nThe standard use of RID and SID mean that each disc written contains a record of the machine that produced a disc (the SID), and which drive wrote it (the RID). This combined knowledge may be very useful to law enforcement, to investigative agencies, and to private or corporate investigators.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = International Federation of the Phonographic Industry | title = Pocket guide to recognising pirate music products | url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/manual-of-guidance-chap3-english.pdf | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Computer hardware]]\n* [[Cue sheet (music software)]]\n* [[Floptical]]\n* [[ISO image]]\n* [[List of optical disc authoring software]]\n* [[MultiLevel Recording]]\n* [[Optical disc authoring]]\n* [[Optical disc recording technologies]]\n* [[Optical jukebox]]\n* [[Phase-change Dual]]\n* [[Receiver (radio)]]\n* [[Ripping]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{HowStuffWorks|cd-burner|How CDs Work}}\n* {{HowStuffWorks|cd-burner|How CD Burners Work}}\n* [http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa.htm Understanding CD-R & CD-RW]\n\n{{Basic computer components}}\n\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Audio storage]]\n[[Category:Optical computer storage]]\n[[Category:Optoelectronics|Disc drive]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n[[Category:Video storage]]\n", "name_user": "Comp.arch", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLoading mechanisms", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_drive"}

The HK33 was essentially a smaller 5.56mm version of the 7.62\u00d751mm [[Heckler & Koch G3]] rifle. As one of the first 5.56mm assault rifles on the market, it would go on to become one of the most widely distributed assault rifles. The HK33 featured a modular design with a wide range of accessories (telescoping butt-stocks, optics, bi-pods, etc.) that could be easily removed and arranged in a variety configurations.\n\n===5.56mm NATO===\n{{main|5.56\u00d745mm NATO}}\n[[File:7.62x51 5.56x45.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] and 5.56\u00d745mm NATO cartridges compared to an [[AA battery]].]]\n\nThe adoption of the M16, the H&K33, and the 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge inspired an international trend towards relatively small-sized, lightweight, high-velocity military service cartridges that allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to the larger and heavier [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge. The 5.56mm cartridge is also much easier to shoot.<ref name=\"quarry.nildram.co.uk\">[http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/Assault.htm Assault Rifles and Their Ammunition: History and Prospects by Anthony G.

In 1967, pursuant to the Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers, a competition was organized to design an assault rifle fit to use the new 5.45-mm cartridge. The AK-74 was designed by \u0410. D. Kryakushin's group under the designer supervision of M. T. Kalashnikov. Based on the competition results, this assault rifle was included in the inventory in 1974 as part of the 5.45-mm small arms complex. The cartridge used in the AK-74 weighs 1.5 times less as compared with the 7.62-mm cartridge. The soldier can carry 1.5 times more cartridges without increasing the weight of the portable reserve ammunition. In addition, the bullet speed of the 5.45-mm caliber is higher.\"</ref>  and it was unveiled in 1977, when it was carried by Soviet [[Russian Airborne Troops|parachute troops]] during the annual [[1977 October Revolution Parade|Red Square parade]].<ref name=\"Century p.271\">''Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century'', 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

The [[CAR-15]] family of weapons served through the [[Vietnam War]].

It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. Highly reliable, light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. In 1978, France introduced the 5.56\u00d745mm [[FAMAS]] bullpup rifle. In 1985, the British introduced the 5.56\u00d745mm [[L85]] bullpup rifle. In the late 1990s, Israel introduced the 5.56mm NATO [[IMI Tavor TAR-21|Tavor TAR-21]]. In 1997, China's [[People's Liberation Army]]'s adopted [[QBZ-95]] in the new [[5.8\u00d742mm DBP87|5.8\u00d742mm]] cartridge, which they claim is superior to the both 5.56\u00d745mm and the 5.45\u00d739mm.

The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', the earliest collection of verses in China, includes many poems that depict the countryside of Puyang. Famous historical figures from Puyang include [[Wu Qi]], a military strategist, [[Shang Yang]], a statesman, and [[L\u00fc Buwei]], a great thinker.\n\n===Three Kingdoms===\nDuring the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, Puyang served as [[Cao Cao]]'s headquarters from 191 until 196 CE in [[Yan Province]] and served as the battlefield for the [[Battle of Yan Province]] from 194-195 CE.<ref name=\"2006dict36\">{{Cite book |last=de Crespigny |first=Rafe |date=2006 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49OvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |pages=35\u201339 |isbn=9789047411840 |accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing Dynasty and Republic of China ===\nPuyang was a county of [[Daming County|Daming Prefecture]], [[Zhili province]]. In 1928, Zhili was abolished and Puyang was incorporated into Henan province.\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nIn August 1949 Puyang was taken back from Henan and included in the experimental province [[Pingyuan (province)|Pingyuan]]. In November 1953 it was finally reinstated under the Henan administration.\n\nIn 1987 a historical relic, made up of a series of clams arranged in [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] patterns, was unearthed. The valuable discovery, which could be dated back to more than 6,400 years ago, had pushed forward the history of Chinese civilization for over 1,400 years, and therefore earned itself an international reputation of \"the First Dragon of China\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&art_id=45277&sid=13706474&con_type=3&d_str=20070526&isSearch=1&sear_year=2007 |title=Battle for the dragon's lair |work=The Standard|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> The Chinese [[Yanhuang]] Culture Researching Association has accordingly named Puyang \"the Hometown of [[Chinese dragon|Chinese Dragons]]\u201d. Abundant heritage along with a long history has endowed Puyang with plenty of tourism resources, which is certainly of great investment value. Chinese scholars therefore regard Puyang as one of the important birthplaces of Chinese civilization.\n\n== Tourist sites ==\nUntil the end of 2012, Puyang has 4 national cultural relics protection units: Qicheng Relics, Tangwu Gong Tablet, the former sites of the revolutionary armies which is including Yancunpu revolutionary site and Shanguai former revolutionary base; 25 provincial cultural relics protection units: Xishuiipo Relics, Huiluan Tablet, the memorial site of the revolutionary armies crossing the river, Chengzhuang site, Tieqiu site, Mazhuang site, Xiancheng Relics, Sipai Pavilion (including the nearby folk houses), the tombstone of Wei's family, Puyang Christ church (including the former site of Huamei school), the Martyrs' Cemetery of Weihe county, the former headquarters of PLA, Balimiao Yellow River \u2013controlling memorial (including the iron beast), Nanle Confucius temple, Kuaikui platform site, [[Cangjie]] mausoleum site, [[Danzhu]] Tomb, [[Zhong You|zilu]] Mausoleum, the headquarters site of the field army, the Puzhao Temple, Gaocheng Relics, Xiaqiu site, the anti-Japanese martyrs' shrine in Qingfeng county, the former administration site of Zhinan CPC, Puyang Catholic church. The key cultural relics protection units of city and county level have 201 sites.\n\nThe main tourist attractions in the city area are Zhongyuan Green Manor, Qicheng Relics, Pushang Park, Cangjie Tomb, Zhanghui Mausoleum, Emperor Shun's Palace, Huiluan Tablet, Imperial Well, Sipai Pavilion, the four street of Ming & Qing dynasties, the hometown of [[Emperor Shun]], Yancunpu revolutionary site, Shanguai former revolutionary base, the museum of the Liu-Deng Army crossing Yellow River, Puyang Science and Technology Museum etc. In 1994, the line of Confucius traveling around the world 2500 years ago had been approved by China National Tourism Administration and State Administration of Cultural Heritage as the first Chinese tourism special line of cultural relics and historic sites, including Puyang Qicheng Relics, Zilu Tomb, Huiluan Tablet etc. After 1999, Puyang opened up another five special tourism lines. In 2005, puyang one-day red tour, two-day tour had been launched and the PLA sites tour containing Shanguai, Sunkou had been recommended by Henan Tourism Administration as a provincial [[red tourism]] line. After 2006, relying on the abundant history and culture resources and its morden city landscape, Puyang developed its tourism deeply and greatly. Till now, Puyang has successfully developed and created a series of tourist brands: the city scenery tour represented by the city squares, gardens and parks, and the water system; the ecological environment tour represented by Zhongyuan Green Manor and Pushang Park; the historical and cultural tour by Qicheng Relics and Cangjie Tomb; the Yellow River scenery tour by Maolou Ecological Tourism Zone; the surname & root seeking tour by Zhanghui Mausoleum and Emperor Shun's Palace; the leisure acrobatics tour by Dongbei village's original acrobatics and modern \"Water show\" acrobatics; the scientific knowledge tour by Puyang Science and Technology Museum, the efficient agriculture tour by Shijin Park; the classical red tour by Shanguai former revolutionary base and the museum of the Liu-Deng Army crossing the Yellow River; and the modern industry tour by Zhongyuan Oilfield, Zhongyuan Ethylene Plant and Zhongyuan Dahua Group Ltd. etc.\n\n== Natural resources ==\nPuyang is a petrol-chemical city. The major mineral resources include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[coal]], etc. especially rich reserve of high-quality petroleum and natural gas. As an important national petrol-chemical energy base, large-sized enterprises such as [[Sinopec|Zhongyuan Oilfield]], China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, Zhongyuan Dahua Group and so on have been established there. The petrol-chemical industry has become the support of Puyang's economy.\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.puyang.gov.cn Government website of Puyang] (in Simplified Chinese)\n*[http://www.puyangchina.com Puyang, China]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110302202607/http://en.hnta.cn/Htmls/City/Puyang/ Amazing Henan]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Henan}}\n{{Major cities along the Yellow River}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Henan]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Henan]]\n", "name_user": "CaradhrasAiguo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyang"}
