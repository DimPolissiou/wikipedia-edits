On entering high school, Tomoharu takes the opportunity to live on his own and moves into Meiou-tei, a dormitory, where he starts enjoying a carefree high school life (also, his mother has recently remarried and doesn't want him interfering in her newlywed life). His life changes when a beautiful girl named Shuri Kurosaki appears with a mysterious trunk which she claims Tomoharu's brother, Naotaka Natsume, asked her to deliver to him. Things become complicated when Kanade Takatsuki, a girl dressed like a shrine maiden, appears seeking the trunk in Tomoharu's possession.

The old city centre consists of three parts: Kalaja (on the castle hill), Mangalem (at the foot of the castle hill) and Gorica (on the left bank of the Osum). It has a wealth of beautiful buildings of high architectural and historical interest. The pine forests above the city, on the slopes of the towering [[Tomorr]] mountains, provide a backdrop of appropriate grandeur. The Osumi river has cut a 915-metre deep gorge through the limestone rock on the west side of the valley to form a precipitous natural fortress, around which the town was built on several river terraces.\n\nAccording to an Albanian legend, the Tomorr mountain was originally a giant, who fought with another giant (mountain) called Shpirag over a young woman.

Some of the landmarks of that historical period could be seen in the Berat Castle, churches of the Byzantine era such as the Church of St. Mary of Blaherna (13th century), the Bachelors' Mosque, the National Ethnographic Museum, the Sultan's Mosque (built between 1481 and 1512), Leaden Mosque (built in 1555) and the Gorica Bridge.<ref name=Unesco>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569 |title=UNESCO.orgHistoric Centres of Berat and Gjirokastra|accessdate=2010-09-07|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Castle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.castle-park.com/berat_city.htm|title=The Castle|publisher=Castle Park|accessdate=5 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226023204/http://www.castle-park.com/berat_city.htm|archivedate=26 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BM\"/><ref name=Museum>{{cite web|url=http://albania.shqiperia.com/kat/m/shfaqart/aid/2243/National-Ethnographic-Museum-Berat.html|title=National Ethnographic Museum, Berat|publisher=Albania Shqiperia|accessdate=5 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224085339/http://albania.shqiperia.com/kat/m/shfaqart/aid/2243/National-Ethnographic-Museum-Berat.html|archive-date=24 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Berat citadel.jpg|thumb|230px|View of the Citadel of Berat.]]\n\n[[Berat Castle]] is built on a rocky hill on the right bank of the river [[Osum]] and is accessible only from the south. After being burned down by the Romans in 200 BC the walls were strengthened in the 5th century under Byzantine [[Emperor Theodosius II]], and were rebuilt during the 6th century under the Emperor [[Justinian I]] and again in the 13th century under the Despot of Epirus, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], cousin of the Byzantine Emperor. The main entrance, on the north side, is defended by a fortified courtyard and there are three smaller entrances. The fortress of Berat in its present state, even though considerably damaged, remains a magnificent sight. The surface that it encompasses made it possible to house a considerable portion of the town's inhabitants. The buildings inside the fortress were built during the 13th century and because of their characteristic architecture are preserved as cultural monuments. The population of the fortress was Christian, and it had about 20 churches (most built during the 13th century) and only one mosque, for the use of the Muslim garrison, (of which there survives only a few ruins and the base of the minaret). The churches of the fortress have been damaged through the years and only some remain.\n\nThe [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Berat)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] dating from the 13th century, has 16th century mural paintings by Nikoll\u00eb Onufri, son of the most important post-medieval Albanian painter, [[Onufri]]. In a small tree - planted square, on a hillside inside the walls of the fortress, stands the 14th century Church of the Holy Trinity. It is built in the form of a cross and has Byzantine murals. Outside the ramparts is the Church of St. Michael (Sh\u00ebn Mehill), built in the 13th century. This church is reached by a steep but perfectly safe path. Near the entrance, after a guardhouse, is the little Church of St. Theodore (Shen Todher), which have wall paintings by Onufri himself. The most interesting is the cathedral of St. Nicholas, which has been well restored and is now a museum dedicated to Onufri. Onufri was the greatest of the 16th century painters in Albania. Not only was he a master of the techniques of fresco and icons, but he was the first to introduce a new colour in painting, shiny red, which the French called \"Onufri's Red\". In addition, Onufri introduced a certain realism and a degree of individuality in facial expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/ShenMeriVllaherna.aspx |title=Kisha e Sh\u00ebn M\u00ebri Vllahern\u00ebs |language=Albanian |accessdate=6 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |total_width = 500\n | align = left\n | background color = #BBDD99\n | width = 200\n | image1 =Old town of berat albania 3.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Old town of berat 1.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | image3 = Old town of berat 2 albania 2016.jpg\n | alt3 = \n | footer_background = #BBDD99\n | footer_align = center\n | footer = The [[UNESCO]] Site of [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokast\u00ebr|Berat]].\n}}\n\nThe first inscription recording Onufri's name was found in 1951, in the Shelqan church. The Kastoria church has a date 23 July 1547 and a reference to Onufri's origin : ''I am Onufri, and come from the town of Berat''. Onufri's style in painting was inherited by his son, Nikolla (Nicholas), though not so successful as his father. In Onufri's museum can be found works of Onufri, his son, Nikolla and other painters'. There are also numbers of icons and some fine examples of religious silversmith's work (sacred vessels, icon casings, covers of Gospel books, etc.). Berat Gospels, which date from the 4th century, are copies (the originals are preserved in the National Archives in Tirana). The church itself has a magnificent iconostasis of carved wood, with two very fine icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The bishop's throne and the pulpit are also of considerable quality. \nNear the street running down from the fortress is the Bachelors' Mosque (Xhami e Beqareve), built in 1827. This has a handsome portico and an interesting external decoration of flowers, plants, houses, etc. The 'Bachelors' were the young shop-assistants (in practice generally unmarried), whom the merchants in Berat used as their own private militia. \n\nThe [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]] ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), the oldest in the town built in the reign of [[Bayazid II]] (1481\u20131512),<ref name=\"Norris56\"/> is notable for its fine ceiling.

It was rebuilt by [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] in 1782. It belongs to the [[Khalwati order|Khalwati Sufi order]]. It is composed of the prayer hall with a square plan, a small ambience for special religious services and a gracious portico in front of the entrance to the prayer hall. In the prayer hall is a mafil carved in wood and decorated. On the eastern side of the prayer hall is the [[mihrab]] decorated with stone stalactites. The inner walls have been decorated with eight frescoes, depicting dwelling houses, [[Muslim]] religious buildings and landscapes.\n\nThe walls below the frescoes are covered by holes that improve the acoustics in the prayer hall. The ceiling of the prayer hall is made of wood and is decorated with paintings valued as the most beautiful of the time. The ceiling has been decorated in the [[Baroque style]] adopted in Islamic art and is covered with 14 carat gold plates. The inner decorations were carried out by Master [[Dush Barka]]. Attached to the prayer hall is a room in which once was the mausoleum of [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] and his son. The portico of the tekke has five stone columns which were taken from the [[ancient Greek]] city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. Above the main door in the portico is an inscription dedicated to the values of the tekke and to [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/THelvetive.aspx|title=Teqja e Helvetive|language=Albanian|accessdate=6 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Monuments dating to the late Ottoman period from the Albanian Vrioni family exist such as the gate to a former palace and a tomb, other monuments are from the Vlora family.<ref name=\"Kiel52\">{{cite book|last=Kiel|first=Machiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania, 1385-1912|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2xYzAAAAIAAJ&dq=Berat+ottoman&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Berat+|year=1990|publisher=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|isbn=978-92-9063-330-3|page=52|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nNear of tekke is purported to be the grave of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], a [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Jew]] who had been banished to [[Dulcigno]] (present day Ulcinj) who created controversy among his followers upon his conversion to [[Islam]].

The old city centre consists of three parts: Kalaja (on the castle hill), Mangalem (at the foot of the castle hill) and Gorica (on the left bank of the Osum). It has a wealth of beautiful buildings of high architectural and historical interest. The pine forests above the city, on the slopes of the towering [[Tomorr]] mountains, provide a backdrop of appropriate grandeur. The Osumi river has cut a 915-metre deep gorge through the limestone rock on the west side of the valley to form a precipitous natural fortress, around which the town was built on several river terraces.\n\nAccording to an Albanian legend, the Tomorr mountain was originally a giant, who fought with another giant (mountain) called Shpirag over a young woman. They killed each other and the girl drowned in her tears, which then became the Osum river.\n\n[[Mount Shpirag]], named after the second giant, is on the left bank of the gorge, above the district of Gorica. Berat is known to Albanians as the city of \"One above another Windows\" (a similar epithet is sometimes applied to [[Gjirokastra]]), or ''The City of Two Thousand Steps''. It was proclaimed a 'Museum City' by the dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] in June 1961.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe earliest recorded inhabitants of the city (6th century BC) were the ancient Greek tribe of the [[Dassaretae]] or Dexarioi, the northernmost subgroup of the [[Chaonians]], and the region was known as ''Dessaretis'' after them.<ref name=\"HammondWalbank1988\" /><ref name=\"LewisBoardman1994\">{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=D.

During the Roman and early Byzantine period, the city was known as ''Pulcheriopolis''.\n\nThe [[First Bulgarian Empire]] under [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian I]] captured the town in the 9th century, and the city received the Slavic name ''Bel[i]grad'' (\"White City\"), Belegrada (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1) in Greek, which persisted throughout the medieval period, changing to ''Berat'' under Ottoman rule. The town became one of the most important towns in the Bulgarian region [[Kutmichevitsa]]. The Bulgarian governor [[Elemag]] surrendered the city to the emperor [[Basil II]] in 1018, and the city remained in Byzantine hands until the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] retook the city in 1203 during the rule of [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]].

Some of the landmarks of that historical period could be seen in the Berat Castle, churches of the Byzantine era such as the Church of St. Mary of Blaherna (13th century), the Bachelors' Mosque, the National Ethnographic Museum, the Sultan's Mosque (built between 1481 and 1512), Leaden Mosque (built in 1555) and the Gorica Bridge.<ref name=Unesco>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569 |title=UNESCO.orgHistoric Centres of Berat and Gjirokastra|accessdate=2010-09-07|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Castle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.castle-park.com/berat_city.htm|title=The Castle|publisher=Castle Park|accessdate=5 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226023204/http://www.castle-park.com/berat_city.htm|archivedate=26 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BM\"/><ref name=Museum>{{cite web|url=http://albania.shqiperia.com/kat/m/shfaqart/aid/2243/National-Ethnographic-Museum-Berat.html|title=National Ethnographic Museum, Berat|publisher=Albania Shqiperia|accessdate=5 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224085339/http://albania.shqiperia.com/kat/m/shfaqart/aid/2243/National-Ethnographic-Museum-Berat.html|archive-date=24 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Berat citadel.jpg|thumb|230px|View of the Citadel of Berat.]]\n\n[[Berat Castle]] is built on a rocky hill on the right bank of the river [[Osum]] and is accessible only from the south. After being burned down by the Romans in 200 BC the walls were strengthened in the 5th century under Byzantine [[Emperor Theodosius II]], and were rebuilt during the 6th century under the Emperor [[Justinian I]] and again in the 13th century under the Despot of Epirus, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], cousin of the Byzantine Emperor. The main entrance, on the north side, is defended by a fortified courtyard and there are three smaller entrances. The fortress of Berat in its present state, even though considerably damaged, remains a magnificent sight. The surface that it encompasses made it possible to house a considerable portion of the town's inhabitants. The buildings inside the fortress were built during the 13th century and because of their characteristic architecture are preserved as cultural monuments. The population of the fortress was Christian, and it had about 20 churches (most built during the 13th century) and only one mosque, for the use of the Muslim garrison, (of which there survives only a few ruins and the base of the minaret). The churches of the fortress have been damaged through the years and only some remain.\n\nThe [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Berat)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] dating from the 13th century, has 16th century mural paintings by Nikoll\u00eb Onufri, son of the most important post-medieval Albanian painter, [[Onufri]]. In a small tree - planted square, on a hillside inside the walls of the fortress, stands the 14th century Church of the Holy Trinity. It is built in the form of a cross and has Byzantine murals. Outside the ramparts is the Church of St. Michael (Sh\u00ebn Mehill), built in the 13th century. This church is reached by a steep but perfectly safe path. Near the entrance, after a guardhouse, is the little Church of St. Theodore (Shen Todher), which have wall paintings by Onufri himself. The most interesting is the cathedral of St. Nicholas, which has been well restored and is now a museum dedicated to Onufri. Onufri was the greatest of the 16th century painters in Albania. Not only was he a master of the techniques of fresco and icons, but he was the first to introduce a new colour in painting, shiny red, which the French called \"Onufri's Red\". In addition, Onufri introduced a certain realism and a degree of individuality in facial expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/ShenMeriVllaherna.aspx |title=Kisha e Sh\u00ebn M\u00ebri Vllahern\u00ebs |language=Albanian |accessdate=6 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |total_width = 500\n | align = left\n | background color = #BBDD99\n | width = 200\n | image1 =Old town of berat albania 3.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Old town of berat 1.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | image3 = Old town of berat 2 albania 2016.jpg\n | alt3 = \n | footer_background = #BBDD99\n | footer_align = center\n | footer = The [[UNESCO]] Site of [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokast\u00ebr|Berat]].\n}}\n\nThe first inscription recording Onufri's name was found in 1951, in the Shelqan church. The Kastoria church has a date 23 July 1547 and a reference to Onufri's origin : ''I am Onufri, and come from the town of Berat''. Onufri's style in painting was inherited by his son, Nikolla (Nicholas), though not so successful as his father. In Onufri's museum can be found works of Onufri, his son, Nikolla and other painters'. There are also numbers of icons and some fine examples of religious silversmith's work (sacred vessels, icon casings, covers of Gospel books, etc.). Berat Gospels, which date from the 4th century, are copies (the originals are preserved in the National Archives in Tirana). The church itself has a magnificent iconostasis of carved wood, with two very fine icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The bishop's throne and the pulpit are also of considerable quality. \nNear the street running down from the fortress is the Bachelors' Mosque (Xhami e Beqareve), built in 1827. This has a handsome portico and an interesting external decoration of flowers, plants, houses, etc. The 'Bachelors' were the young shop-assistants (in practice generally unmarried), whom the merchants in Berat used as their own private militia. \n\nThe [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]] ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), the oldest in the town built in the reign of [[Bayazid II]] (1481\u20131512),<ref name=\"Norris56\"/> is notable for its fine ceiling.

It was rebuilt by [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] in 1782. It belongs to the [[Khalwati order|Khalwati Sufi order]]. It is composed of the prayer hall with a square plan, a small ambience for special religious services and a gracious portico in front of the entrance to the prayer hall. In the prayer hall is a mafil carved in wood and decorated. On the eastern side of the prayer hall is the [[mihrab]] decorated with stone stalactites. The inner walls have been decorated with eight frescoes, depicting dwelling houses, [[Muslim]] religious buildings and landscapes.\n\nThe walls below the frescoes are covered by holes that improve the acoustics in the prayer hall. The ceiling of the prayer hall is made of wood and is decorated with paintings valued as the most beautiful of the time. The ceiling has been decorated in the [[Baroque style]] adopted in Islamic art and is covered with 14 carat gold plates. The inner decorations were carried out by Master [[Dush Barka]]. Attached to the prayer hall is a room in which once was the mausoleum of [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]] and his son. The portico of the tekke has five stone columns which were taken from the [[ancient Greek]] city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. Above the main door in the portico is an inscription dedicated to the values of the tekke and to [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beratkulture.com/THelvetive.aspx|title=Teqja e Helvetive|language=Albanian|accessdate=6 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Monuments dating to the late Ottoman period from the Albanian Vrioni family exist such as the gate to a former palace and a tomb, other monuments are from the Vlora family.<ref name=\"Kiel52\">{{cite book|last=Kiel|first=Machiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania, 1385-1912|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2xYzAAAAIAAJ&dq=Berat+ottoman&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Berat+|year=1990|publisher=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|isbn=978-92-9063-330-3|page=52|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nNear of tekke is purported to be the grave of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], a [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Jew]] who had been banished to [[Dulcigno]] (present day Ulcinj) who created controversy among his followers upon his conversion to [[Islam]].

It is located  {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city, along the [[North Saskatchewan River]]. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves. This was meant to provide convenient access to the prison for the Warden while normalizing life for the Warden's wife and children; recognizing his duel role as Warden, and as father/husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmurrayarchitect.ca/fort-saskatchewan-historic-buildings/|title=Fort Saskatchewan Historic Buildings|date=2016-03-02|website=David Murray Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion and development ===\nIn 1952, [[Sherritt Gordon Mines]] started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, which started production in 1954.<ref name=\"peterream4\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=459}}</ref> Following Sherritt Gordon's locating in Fort Saskatchewan, more industries constructed plants in the town.

Three models of the design measuring {{convert|3|ft|m}}, {{convert|18|ft|m}}, and {{convert|30|ft|m}} were initially created.

A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she was known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. She wrote her first book, ''Beast And Man'' (1978), when she was in her fifties, and went on to write over 15 more, including ''Animals and Why They Matter'' (1983), ''Wickedness'' (1984), ''The Ethical Primate'' (1994), ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), and ''Science as Salvation'' (1992). She was awarded honorary doctorates by [[Durham University|Durham]] and Newcastle universities. Her autobiography, ''The Owl of Minerva'', was published in 2005.\n\nMidgley strongly opposed [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities\u2014a role for which it is wholly inadequate, she argued. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. Several of her books and articles discussed philosophical ideas appearing in popular science, including those of [[Richard Dawkins]]. She also wrote in favour of a moral interpretation of the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. ''The Guardian'' described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's \"foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension'\".<ref name=brown2001>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMidgley was born in London to Lesley and Tom Scrutton.<ref name=\"nytobit\" /> Her father, the son of the eminent judge Sir [[Thomas Edward Scrutton]], was a [[curate]] in Dulwich and later chaplain of [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College, Cambridge]]. She was raised in Cambridge, Greenford and Ealing, and educated at [[Downe House School]] in [[Cold Ash, Berkshire]], where she developed her interest in classics and philosophy:\n\n[[File:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|left|Midgley's father was a [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] chaplain.]]\n<blockquote>[A] new and vigorous Classics teacher offered to teach a few of us [[Classical Greek|Greek]], and that too was somehow slotted into our timetables. We loved this and worked madly at it, which meant that with considerable efforts on all sides, it was just possible for us to go to college on Classics \u2026 I had decided to read Classics rather than English \u2013 which was the first choice that occurred to me \u2013 because my English teacher, bless her, pointed out that English literature is something that you read in any case, so it is better to study something that you otherwise wouldn't. Someone also told me that, if you did Classics at Oxford, you could do Philosophy as well. I knew very little about this but, as I had just found Plato, I couldn't resist trying it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|page=62}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Somerville College.jpg|thumb|Midgley read [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] at Oxford, going up to [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] in 1938.]]\nShe took the Oxford entrance exam in the autumn of 1937, gaining a place at [[Somerville College]]. During the year before starting university, it was arranged that she would live in [[Austria]] for three months to learn [[German language|German]], but she had to leave after a month because of the [[Anschluss|worsening political situation]]. At Somerville she studied [[Literae Humaniores|Mods and Greats]] alongside [[Iris Murdoch]], graduating with first-class honours.\n\nSeveral of her lasting friendships that began at Oxford were with scientists, and she credited them with having educated her in a number of scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|pages=93\u201394}}</ref> After a split in the Labour club at Oxford over the Soviet Union's actions, she was on the committee of the newly formed Democratic Socialist Club alongside [[Tony Crosland]] and [[Roy Jenkins]]. She writes that her career in philosophy may have been affected by women having a greater voice in discussion at the time, because many male undergraduates left after a year to fight in the [[Second World War]]: \"I think myself that this experience has something to do with the fact that [[Elizabeth Anscombe|Elizabeth]] [Anscombe] and I and [[Iris Murdoch|Iris]] [Murdoch] and [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Mary Warnock]] have all made our names in philosophy... I do think that in normal times a lot of good female thinking is wasted because it simply doesn't get heard.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|page=123}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMidgley left Oxford in 1942 and went into the [[civil service]], as \"the war put graduate work right out of the question\".

She returned to Oxford in 1947 to do graduate work with [[Gilbert Murray]]. She began research on [[Plotinus]]'s view of the soul, which she has described as \"so unfashionable and so vast that I never finished my thesis\".<ref name=\"notdoc\" /> In retrospect Midgley has written of her belief that she is \"lucky\" to have missed out in having a [[doctorate]]. She argues that one of the main flaws in doctoral training is that, while it \"shows you how to deal with difficult arguments\", it does not \"help you to grasp the big questions that provide its context \u2013 the background issues out of which the small problems arose.\"<ref name=\"notdoc\" />\n\nIn 1949 Midgley went to [[Reading University]], teaching in the philosophy department there for four terms.

Nor is it even clear that religion itself is something that the human race either can or should be cured of.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|year=2003|page=40}}</ref>\n\nMidgley's book ''Wickedness'' (1984) has been described as coming \"closest to addressing a theological theme: the problem of evil.\"<ref name=erasmus>{{cite web|last=McEachran|first=Alan|title=Mary Midgley|url=http://ptolemy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/MaryMidgley.pdf|work=Erasmus Darwin Society|accessdate=27 March 2014|date=May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327223917/http://ptolemy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/MaryMidgley.pdf|archive-date=27 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> But, Midgley argues that we need to understand the human capacity for wickedness, rather than blaming God for it. Midgley argues that evil arises from aspects of human nature, not from an external force. She further argues that evil is the absence of good, with good being described as the positive virtues such as generosity, courage and kindness. Therefore, evil is the absence of these characteristics, leading to selfishness, cowardice and similar. She therefore criticises existentialism and other schools of thought which promote the 'Rational Will' as a free agent. She also criticises the tendency to demonise those deemed 'wicked', by failing to acknowledge that they also display some measure of some of the virtues.<ref name=erasmus />\n\nMidgley also expressed her interest in [[Paul Davies]]' ideas on the inherent improbability of the order found in the universe. She argued that \"there's some sort of tendency towards the formation of order\", including towards life and \"perceptive life\".<ref name=observer2014 /> The best way, she argued, of talking about this is using the concept of \"a life force\", although she acknowledged that this is \"vague\".<ref name=observer2014 /> She also argued that \"gratitude\" is an important part of the motivation for [[theism]]. \"You go out on a day like this and you're really grateful. I don't know who to.\"<ref name=observer2014 />\n\nThis understanding also links with Midgley's argument that the concept of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] has \"both a scientific and a religious aspect.\"<ref name=demosp21>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=21|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archivedate=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She argued that people find this hard to grasp because our views on both science and religion have been narrowed so much that the connections between them are now obscured.<ref name=demosp21 /> This is not, however, about belief in a personal God, but instead about responding to the system of life, as revealed by Gaia, with \"wonder, awe and gratitude\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=24|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archivedate=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gaia and philosophy===\nMidgley was supportive of [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]].

She argued that human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted.<ref name=observer2014 /> She criticised existentialists who argued that there was no such thing as human nature and writers such as [[Desmond Morris]] who she understood as arguing that human nature was \"brutal and nasty\".<ref name=observer2014 /> Instead, she argued that human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] methods of ethology and [[comparative psychology]], and that this approach showed that \"we do have a nature and it's much more in the middle.<ref name=observer2014 />\n\nWriting in the 2002 introduction to the reprint of ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), Midgley reported that she wrote both this book, and the later ''Science as Salvation'' (1992) to counter the \"quasi-scientific speculation\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=ix|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> of \"certain remarkable [[Prophesy|prophetic]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] passages that appeared suddenly in scientific books, often in their last chapters.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=iii|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> ''Evolution as a Religion'' dealt with the theories of evolutionary biologists, including [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]], while ''Science as Salvation'' dealt with the theories of physicists and [[artificial intelligence]] researchers. Midgley writes that she still believes that these theories, \"have nothing to do with any reputable theory of evolution,\"<ref name=intropx>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=x|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> and will not solve the real social and moral problems the world is facing, either through [[genetic engineering]] or the use of machines. She concludes: \"These schemes still seem to me to be just displacement activities proposed in order to avoid facing our real difficulties.\"<ref name=intropx /> \"[I]n exposing these rhetorical attempts to turn science into a comprehensive ideology,\" she wrote in ''The myths we live by'', \"I am not attacking science but defending it against dangerous misconstructions.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|year=2003|page=30}}</ref>\n\nMidgley argued against reductionism, or the attempt to impose any one approach to understanding the world. She suggests that there are \"many maps, many windows,\" arguing that \"we need ''scientific pluralism''\u2014the recognition that there are many independent forms and sources of knowledge\u2014rather than reductivism, the conviction that one fundamental form underlies them all and settles everything.\" She writes that it is helpful to think of the world as \"a huge aquarium. We cannot see it as a whole from above, so we peer in at it through a number of small windows ... We can eventually make quite a lot of sense of this habitat if we patiently put together the data from different angles.

She attacks the understanding inherent in this argument that everything, including a sense of self, can be understood through its physical properties.<ref name=observer2014>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness|work=The Observer|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=23 March 2014}}</ref> Instead, she argues that there are different levels of explanation, which need to be studied using different methods.

Midgley disputed this view, arguing that while Dawkins purports to be talking about genes\u2014that is, chemical arrangements\u2014he nonetheless slides over to saying that \"we are born selfish\" (''The Selfish Gene'', p.&nbsp;3).\n\nShe wrote that she had previously \"not attended to Dawkins, thinking it unnecessary to '[[Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?|break a butterfly upon a wheel]]'. But Mr Mackie's article is not the only indication I have lately met of serious attention being paid to his fantasies.\"<ref name=\"Gene Juggling\"/> In a rejoinder in 1981, Dawkins retorted that the comment was \"hard to match, in reputable journals, for its patronising condescension toward a fellow academic.\"<ref name=dawkins81>[http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c114612/documents/2008/Reply_to_Midgley.pdf Dawkins 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301125759/http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c114612/documents/2008/Reply_to_Midgley.pdf |date=1 March 2011 }}</ref> He wrote that she \"raises the art of misunderstanding to dizzy heights.

In a note to page 55 in the 2nd edition of ''The Selfish Gene'' (1989), Dawkins refers to her \"highly intemperate and vicious paper.\" Midgley continued to criticise Dawkins' ideas. In her books ''Evolution as a Religion'' (2002) and ''The Myths We Live By'' (2003), she writes about what she sees as his confused use of language\u2014the sleight of hand involved in using terms such as \"selfish\" in different ways without alerting the reader to the change in meaning\u2014and some of what she regards as his [[rhetoric]] (\"genes exert ultimate power over behaviour\"), which she argues is more akin to religion than science. She wrote in a letter to ''The Guardian'' in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>[There is] widespread discontent with the [[neo-Darwinist]]\u2014or Dawkinsist\u2014orthodoxy that claims something which Darwin himself denied, namely that natural selection is the sole and exclusive cause of evolution, making the world therefore, in some important sense, entirely random. This is itself a strange faith which ought not to be taken for granted as part of science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/06/religion.news|title=Letters: Designs on Darwinism|date=5 September 2005|website=the Guardian}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in September 2007, she argued that Dawkins' views on evolution are ideologically driven: \"The ideology Dawkins is selling is the worship of competition. It is projecting a [[Thatcherite]] take on economics on to evolution. It's not an impartial scientific view; it's a political drama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article2977701.ece|title=Jackson, 3 January 2008}}</ref> In April 2009 Midgley reiterated her critical interpretation of ''The Selfish Gene'' as part of a series of articles on [[Hobbes]] in ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/20/religion-philosophy-hobbes-dawkins-selfishness|title=Mary Midgley: Selfishness: where Dawkins got it wrong|first=Mary|last=Midgley|date=20 April 2009|website=the Guardian}}</ref> In her 2010 book ''The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene'', she argues that \"simple one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the \"selfish gene\" tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic.\"<ref>''The Solitary Self'', publisher's description</ref>\n\n==Midgley in art==\nMidgley is referred to in ''[[The Lives of Animals]]'' (1999), an unusual fictional work by the South African novelist [[J. M. Coetzee]]. The book has been likened to a cross between a short story and a philosophical dialogue, as Coetzee's protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, often speaks at length about philosophical ideas. Many reviewers expressed bafflement at the text, which has an enigmatic and riddling style. As one reviewer noted, \"the reader is not quite sure whether he is intended to spot some confusion or contradiction or non-sequitur in [the protagonist's] arguments.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/11/20/disturbing-the-peace/ | title=Disturbing the Peace - a review of Elizabeth Costello by J.M.

Andy Lamey wrote that the result of these and other similarities is that Coetzee's work \"evoke[s] a particular conception of ethics, one very similar to that of the philosopher Mary Midgley. Such a view affords a central role to sympathy and is fundamentally opposed to a long-standing rival view, most clearly exemplified by the social contract tradition, which prioritizes an instrumental conception of rationality.\"<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 172; for similarities between Midley and Coetzee, see pp. 175\u2013181</ref>\n\nCoetzee and Midgley additionally shared a longstanding fascination with [[Robinson Crusoe]]. Coetzee retells the Crusoe story in his novel ''[[Foe (Coetzee novel)|Foe]]'', while Midgley wrote about Crusoe in her essay \"Duties Concerning Islands.\" Midgley's essay argued for the idea that human beings can have ethical obligations to non-human entities such as animals and ecosystems, an idea also found in ''The Lives of Animals'', ''Foe'' and many other works by Coetzee.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 175</ref>\n\nMidgley agreed to sit for sculptor [[Jon Edgar]] in Newcastle during 2006, as part of the [[Environment Triptych]], along with heads of [[Richard Mabey]] and [[James Lovelock]].<ref>Edgar 2008</ref> This was exhibited at [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]] in 2013.<ref>''Jon Edgar - Sculpture Series Heads: Terracotta Portraits of Contributors to British Sculpture'' (2013) Scott, M., Hall, P., and Pheby, H. {{ISBN|978-0955867514}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n;Books\n*''Beast and Man: The Roots of Human Nature''.

A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she was known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. She wrote her first book, ''Beast And Man'' (1978), when she was in her fifties, and went on to write over 15 more, including ''Animals and Why They Matter'' (1983), ''Wickedness'' (1984), ''The Ethical Primate'' (1994), ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), and ''Science as Salvation'' (1992). She was awarded honorary doctorates by [[Durham University|Durham]] and Newcastle universities. Her autobiography, ''The Owl of Minerva'', was published in 2005.\n\nMidgley strongly opposed [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities\u2014a role for which it is wholly inadequate, she argued. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals.

Midgley argues that evil arises from aspects of human nature, not from an external force. She further argues that evil is the absence of good, with good being described as the positive virtues such as generosity, courage and kindness. Therefore, evil is the absence of these characteristics, leading to selfishness, cowardice and similar. She therefore criticises existentialism and other schools of thought which promote the 'Rational Will' as a free agent. She also criticises the tendency to demonise those deemed 'wicked', by failing to acknowledge that they also display some measure of some of the virtues.<ref name=erasmus />\n\nMidgley also expressed her interest in [[Paul Davies]]' ideas on the inherent improbability of the order found in the universe. She argued that \"there's some sort of tendency towards the formation of order\", including towards life and \"perceptive life\".<ref name=observer2014 /> The best way, she argued, of talking about this is using the concept of \"a life force\", although she acknowledged that this is \"vague\".<ref name=observer2014 /> She also argued that \"gratitude\" is an important part of the motivation for [[theism]]. \"You go out on a day like this and you're really grateful.

She argued that human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted.<ref name=observer2014 /> She criticised existentialists who argued that there was no such thing as human nature and writers such as [[Desmond Morris]] who she understood as arguing that human nature was \"brutal and nasty\".<ref name=observer2014 /> Instead, she argued that human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] methods of ethology and [[comparative psychology]], and that this approach showed that \"we do have a nature and it's much more in the middle.<ref name=observer2014 />\n\nWriting in the 2002 introduction to the reprint of ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), Midgley reported that she wrote both this book, and the later ''Science as Salvation'' (1992) to counter the \"quasi-scientific speculation\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=ix|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> of \"certain remarkable [[Prophesy|prophetic]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] passages that appeared suddenly in scientific books, often in their last chapters.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=iii|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> ''Evolution as a Religion'' dealt with the theories of evolutionary biologists, including [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]], while ''Science as Salvation'' dealt with the theories of physicists and [[artificial intelligence]] researchers. Midgley writes that she still believes that these theories, \"have nothing to do with any reputable theory of evolution,\"<ref name=intropx>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=x|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> and will not solve the real social and moral problems the world is facing, either through [[genetic engineering]] or the use of machines.

In a note to page 55 in the 2nd edition of ''The Selfish Gene'' (1989), Dawkins refers to her \"highly intemperate and vicious paper.\" Midgley continued to criticise Dawkins' ideas. In her books ''Evolution as a Religion'' (2002) and ''The Myths We Live By'' (2003), she writes about what she sees as his confused use of language\u2014the sleight of hand involved in using terms such as \"selfish\" in different ways without alerting the reader to the change in meaning\u2014and some of what she regards as his [[rhetoric]] (\"genes exert ultimate power over behaviour\"), which she argues is more akin to religion than science. She wrote in a letter to ''The Guardian'' in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>[There is] widespread discontent with the [[neo-Darwinist]]\u2014or Dawkinsist\u2014orthodoxy that claims something which Darwin himself denied, namely that natural selection is the sole and exclusive cause of evolution, making the world therefore, in some important sense, entirely random.

It is projecting a [[Thatcherite]] take on economics on to evolution. It's not an impartial scientific view; it's a political drama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article2977701.ece|title=Jackson, 3 January 2008}}</ref> In April 2009 Midgley reiterated her critical interpretation of ''The Selfish Gene'' as part of a series of articles on [[Hobbes]] in ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/20/religion-philosophy-hobbes-dawkins-selfishness|title=Mary Midgley: Selfishness: where Dawkins got it wrong|first=Mary|last=Midgley|date=20 April 2009|website=the Guardian}}</ref> In her 2010 book ''The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene'', she argues that \"simple one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the \"selfish gene\" tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic.\"<ref>''The Solitary Self'', publisher's description</ref>\n\n==Midgley in art==\nMidgley is referred to in ''[[The Lives of Animals]]'' (1999), an unusual fictional work by the South African novelist [[J. M. Coetzee]]. The book has been likened to a cross between a short story and a philosophical dialogue, as Coetzee's protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, often speaks at length about philosophical ideas. Many reviewers expressed bafflement at the text, which has an enigmatic and riddling style. As one reviewer noted, \"the reader is not quite sure whether he is intended to spot some confusion or contradiction or non-sequitur in [the protagonist's] arguments.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/11/20/disturbing-the-peace/ | title=Disturbing the Peace - a review of Elizabeth Costello by J.M.

Andy Lamey wrote that the result of these and other similarities is that Coetzee's work \"evoke[s] a particular conception of ethics, one very similar to that of the philosopher Mary Midgley. Such a view affords a central role to sympathy and is fundamentally opposed to a long-standing rival view, most clearly exemplified by the social contract tradition, which prioritizes an instrumental conception of rationality.\"<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 172; for similarities between Midley and Coetzee, see pp. 175\u2013181</ref>\n\nCoetzee and Midgley additionally shared a longstanding fascination with [[Robinson Crusoe]]. Coetzee retells the Crusoe story in his novel ''[[Foe (Coetzee novel)|Foe]]'', while Midgley wrote about Crusoe in her essay \"Duties Concerning Islands.\" Midgley's essay argued for the idea that human beings can have ethical obligations to non-human entities such as animals and ecosystems, an idea also found in ''The Lives of Animals'', ''Foe'' and many other works by Coetzee.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 175</ref>\n\nMidgley agreed to sit for sculptor [[Jon Edgar]] in Newcastle during 2006, as part of the [[Environment Triptych]], along with heads of [[Richard Mabey]] and [[James Lovelock]].<ref>Edgar 2008</ref> This was exhibited at [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]] in 2013.<ref>''Jon Edgar - Sculpture Series Heads: Terracotta Portraits of Contributors to British Sculpture'' (2013) Scott, M., Hall, P., and Pheby, H. {{ISBN|978-0955867514}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n;Books\n*''Beast and Man: The Roots of Human Nature''.
