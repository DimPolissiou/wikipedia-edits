They are important contributors to [[arctic exploration|exploration]] of the [[Arctic]].  The stations are named '''North Pole''' ('''NP'''; {{lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0441|translit=Severny polyus}}, {{lang|ru|\u0421\u041f}}), followed by an ordinal number: [[North Pole-1]], etc.\n\n==Overview==\n\n\"NP\" [[drift station]]s carry out the program of complex year-round research in the fields of [[oceanology]], ice studies, [[meteorology]], [[aerology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrochemistry]], [[hydrophysics]], and [[marine biology]]. On average, an \"NP\" station is the host for 600 to 650 ocean depth measurements, 3500 to 3900 complex meteorology measurements, 1200 to 1300 temperature measurements and sea water probes for [[chemical analysis]], and 600 to 650 [[research balloon]] launches. [[Magnetism|Magnetic]], [[ionosphere]], ice and other observations are also carried out there. Regular measurements of the ice floe coordinates provide the data on the direction and speed of its drift.\n\nThe modern \"NP\" drifting ice station resembles a small settlement with housing for polar explorers and special buildings for the scientific equipment. Usually an \"NP\" station begins operations in April and continues for two or three years until the [[Drift ice|ice floe]] reaches the [[Greenland Sea]]. Polar explorers are replaced yearly. Since 1937 some 800 people were drifting at \"NP\" stations.\n\nThere are two groups of \"NP\" stations:\n*stations, drifting on the [[pack ice]] (i.e. relatively thin and short-lived ice):\"NP-1\" through \"NP-5\", \"NP-7\" through \"NP-17\", \"NP-20\", \"NP-21\"\n*stations, drifting on ice islands ([[glacier]] fragments, that were split from the shore): \"NP-6\", \"NP-18\", \"NP-19\", \"NP-22\".\n\nAll \"NP\" stations are organized by the Russian (former Soviet) [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] (AARI).\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea to use the [[drift ice]] for the exploration of nature in the high latitudes of the [[Arctic Ocean]] came from [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who fulfilled it on ''[[Fram]]'' between 1893 and 1896. The first stations to use drift ice as means of scientific exploration of the Arctic originated in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1937, when the first such station in the world, [[North Pole-1]], started operations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html | title=North Pole drifting stations (1930s-1980s) | publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution | accessdate=April 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nNorth Pole-1 was established on May 21, 1937 some 20&nbsp;km from the [[North Pole]] by the expedition into the high latitudes. [[Sever-1]], led by [[Otto Schmidt]]. \"NP-1\" operated for 9 months, during which the ice floe travelled 2,850 kilometres. On February 19, 1938, Soviet [[ice breaker]]s ''[[Icebreaker Taymyr|Taimyr]]'' and ''[[Icebreaker Murman|Murman]]'' took off four polar explorers from the station, who immediately became famous in the USSR and were awarded titles [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]: [[hydrobiology|hydrobiologist]] [[Pyotr Shirshov]], geophysicist [[Yevgeny Konstantinovich Fyodorov|Yevgeny Fyodorov]], [[radio]]man [[Ernst Krenkel]] and their leader [[Ivan Papanin]].\n\nSince 1954 Soviet \"NP\" stations worked continuously, with one to three such stations operating simultaneously each year. The total distance drifted between 1937 and 1973 was over 80,000 kilometres. [[North Pole-22]] is particularly notable for its record drift, lasting nine years. On June 28, 1972 the ice floe with [[North Pole-19]] passed over the North Pole for the first time ever.\n\nDuring such long-term observations by \"NP\" stations, a lot of important discoveries in [[physical geography]] were made, valuable conclusions on regularities and the connection between processes in the polar region of the [[Earth]]'s [[hydrosphere]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] were obtained. Some of the most important discoveries were finding the deep-water [[Lomonosov Ridge]],<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=Surface at the Pole\n  |last=Calvert  |first=James, Vice Admiral USN Ret.\n  |origyear=1960\n  |year=1996\n  |publisher=Bluejacket Books  |location=Annapolis, Maryland\n  |isbn=1-55750-119-X\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=86\n}}</ref> which crosses the Arctic Ocean, other large features of the ocean bottom's relief, the discovery of two systems of the drift (circular and \"wash-out\"), the fact of [[cyclone]]s' active penetration into the [[Central Arctic]].\n\nThe last Soviet \"NP\" station, [[North Pole-31]], was closed in July 1991.\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, Russian exploration of the Arctic by drifting ice stations was suspended for twelve years. The year 2003 was notable for Russia's return into the Arctic. {{As of|2006}}, three \"NP\" stations had carried out scientific measurements and research since then: \"NP-32\" through \"NP-34\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The latter was closed on May 25, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n\"NP-35\" started operations on September 21, 2007 at the point {{Coord|81|26|N|103|30|E|scale:5000000_region:XN|name=North Pole-35 (start)}}, when flags of Russia and [[Saint Petersburg]] were raised there. 22 scientists, led by A.A.Visnevsky are working on the ice floe. Establishment of the station was the third stage of the [[Arktika 2007]] expedition. An appropriate ice floe was searched for from ''[[Akademik Fedorov]]'' [[research vessel]], accompanied by [[nuclear icebreaker]] ''Russia'', using [[Mil Mi-8|MI-8 helicopters]], for a week, until an ice floe with an area of 16 square kilometres was found.<ref>[http://www.aari.nw.ru/docs/press_release/20070921_sp35.html September 21, 2007 Press-Release]{{dead link|date=December 2016

They are important contributors to [[arctic exploration|exploration]] of the [[Arctic]].  The stations are named '''North Pole''' ('''NP'''; {{lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0441|translit=Severny polyus}}, {{lang|ru|\u0421\u041f}}), followed by an ordinal number: [[North Pole-1]], etc.\n\n==Overview==\n\n\"NP\" [[drift station]]s carry out the program of complex year-round research in the fields of [[oceanology]], ice studies, [[meteorology]], [[aerology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrochemistry]], [[hydrophysics]], and [[marine biology]]. On average, an \"NP\" station is the host for 600 to 650 ocean depth measurements, 3500 to 3900 complex meteorology measurements, 1200 to 1300 temperature measurements and sea water probes for [[chemical analysis]], and 600 to 650 [[research balloon]] launches. [[Magnetism|Magnetic]], [[ionosphere]], ice and other observations are also carried out there. Regular measurements of the ice floe coordinates provide the data on the direction and speed of its drift.\n\nThe modern \"NP\" drifting ice station resembles a small settlement with housing for polar explorers and special buildings for the scientific equipment. Usually an \"NP\" station begins operations in April and continues for two or three years until the [[Drift ice|ice floe]] reaches the [[Greenland Sea]]. Polar explorers are replaced yearly. Since 1937 some 800 people were drifting at \"NP\" stations.\n\nThere are two groups of \"NP\" stations:\n*stations, drifting on the [[pack ice]] (i.e. relatively thin and short-lived ice):\"NP-1\" through \"NP-5\", \"NP-7\" through \"NP-17\", \"NP-20\", \"NP-21\"\n*stations, drifting on ice islands ([[glacier]] fragments, that were split from the shore): \"NP-6\", \"NP-18\", \"NP-19\", \"NP-22\".\n\nAll \"NP\" stations are organized by the Russian (former Soviet) [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] (AARI).\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea to use the [[drift ice]] for the exploration of nature in the high latitudes of the [[Arctic Ocean]] came from [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who fulfilled it on ''[[Fram]]'' between 1893 and 1896. The first stations to use drift ice as means of scientific exploration of the Arctic originated in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1937, when the first such station in the world, [[North Pole-1]], started operations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html | title=North Pole drifting stations (1930s-1980s) | publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution | accessdate=April 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nNorth Pole-1 was established on May 21, 1937 some 20&nbsp;km from the [[North Pole]] by the expedition into the high latitudes. [[Sever-1]], led by [[Otto Schmidt]]. \"NP-1\" operated for 9 months, during which the ice floe travelled 2,850 kilometres. On February 19, 1938, Soviet [[ice breaker]]s ''[[Icebreaker Taymyr|Taimyr]]'' and ''[[Icebreaker Murman|Murman]]'' took off four polar explorers from the station, who immediately became famous in the USSR and were awarded titles [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]: [[hydrobiology|hydrobiologist]] [[Pyotr Shirshov]], geophysicist [[Yevgeny Konstantinovich Fyodorov|Yevgeny Fyodorov]], [[radio]]man [[Ernst Krenkel]] and their leader [[Ivan Papanin]].\n\nSince 1954 Soviet \"NP\" stations worked continuously, with one to three such stations operating simultaneously each year. The total distance drifted between 1937 and 1973 was over 80,000 kilometres. [[North Pole-22]] is particularly notable for its record drift, lasting nine years. On June 28, 1972 the ice floe with [[North Pole-19]] passed over the North Pole for the first time ever.\n\nDuring such long-term observations by \"NP\" stations, a lot of important discoveries in [[physical geography]] were made, valuable conclusions on regularities and the connection between processes in the polar region of the [[Earth]]'s [[hydrosphere]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] were obtained. Some of the most important discoveries were finding the deep-water [[Lomonosov Ridge]],<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=Surface at the Pole\n  |last=Calvert  |first=James, Vice Admiral USN Ret.\n  |origyear=1960\n  |year=1996\n  |publisher=Bluejacket Books  |location=Annapolis, Maryland\n  |isbn=1-55750-119-X\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=86\n}}</ref> which crosses the Arctic Ocean, other large features of the ocean bottom's relief, the discovery of two systems of the drift (circular and \"wash-out\"), the fact of [[cyclone]]s' active penetration into the [[Central Arctic]].\n\nThe last Soviet \"NP\" station, [[North Pole-31]], was closed in July 1991.\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, Russian exploration of the Arctic by drifting ice stations was suspended for twelve years. The year 2003 was notable for Russia's return into the Arctic. {{As of|2006}}, three \"NP\" stations had carried out scientific measurements and research since then: \"NP-32\" through \"NP-34\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The latter was closed on May 25, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n\"NP-35\" started operations on September 21, 2007 at the point {{Coord|81|26|N|103|30|E|scale:5000000_region:XN|name=North Pole-35 (start)}}, when flags of Russia and [[Saint Petersburg]] were raised there. 22 scientists, led by A.A.Visnevsky are working on the ice floe. Establishment of the station was the third stage of the [[Arktika 2007]] expedition. An appropriate ice floe was searched for from ''[[Akademik Fedorov]]'' [[research vessel]], accompanied by [[nuclear icebreaker]] ''Russia'', using [[Mil Mi-8|MI-8 helicopters]], for a week, until an ice floe with an area of 16 square kilometres was found.<ref>[http://www.aari.nw.ru/docs/press_release/20070921_sp35.html September 21, 2007 Press-Release]{{dead link|date=December 2016

He was king of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] from 1186 to 1192 [[Jure uxoris|by right of marriage]] to [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]], and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] from 1192 to 1194. Having arrived in the [[Holy Land]] (where his brother [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery of Lusignan]] was already prominent) at an unknown date, Guy was hastily married to Sibylla in 1180 to prevent a political incident within the kingdom. As the health of his brother-in-law, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], deteriorated, Guy was appointed [[regent]] for his stepson by Sibylla, [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]]. Baldwin IV died in 1185, followed shortly by Baldwin V in 1186, leading to the succession of Sibylla and Guy to the throne. Guy's reign was marked by increased hostilities with the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] ruled by [[Saladin]], culminating in the [[Battle of Hattin]] in July 1187\u2014during which Guy was captured\u2014and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] itself three months later.\n\nFollowing a year of imprisonment in [[Damascus]], Guy was released by Saladin. After being denied entry to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], one of the last crusader strongholds, by [[Conrad of Montferrat]], Guy [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|besieged Acre]] in 1189. The siege, during which Guy's wife died, developed into a rallying point for the [[Third Crusade]], led by [[Philip II of France]] and [[Richard I of England]]. Guy entered a bitter row with Conrad over the kingship of Jerusalem; despite Richard's support for the widower king, Conrad married Sibylla's half-sister [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella]] and was elected king by the nobility of the kingdom. Conrad was assassinated by [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] days after the election; Richard's and Guy's involvement in the incident is suspected, but unproven. Nevertheless, Guy was compensated for the dispossession of his crown by being given lordship of Cyprus in 1192, which Richard had taken from the [[Byzantine Empire]] en route to the Levant. Guy ruled the Kingdom of Cyprus until his death in 1194, when he was succeeded by his brother [[Aimery of Cyprus|Amalric]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Political rise===\nGuy was a son of Lord [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan|Hugh VIII]] of [[Lusignan]], in [[Poitou]], at that time a part of the French duchy of [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], held by [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Queen Eleanor]] of England, her third son [[Richard I of England|Richard]], and her husband the English King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].\n\nIn 1168 Guy and his brothers ambushed and killed [[Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], who was returning from a [[pilgrimage]]. They were banished from Poitou by their overlord, Richard I, then (acting) [[Duke of Aquitaine]].\n\nGuy went to Jerusalem at some date between 1173 and 1180,<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 157 and notes 127 and 128</ref> initially as a pilgrim or Crusader; [[Bernard Hamilton]] suggests that he may have arrived with the French Crusaders of 1179.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 157 and note 126</ref> In 1174, his older brother [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]] had married the daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]] and entered court circles. Amalric had also obtained the patronage of King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and of his mother [[Agnes of Courtenay]] who held the [[county of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and was married to [[Reginald of Sidon]]. He was appointed Agnes's Constable in Jaffa, and later [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|Constable]] of the Kingdom. Later, hostile rumours alleged he was Agnes's lover, but this is questionable. It is likely that his promotions were aimed at weaning him away from the political orbit of the [[Ibelin family]], who were associated with [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]]'s cousin and the former [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Bailiffs|''bailli'' or regent]]. Amalric of Lusignan's success is likely to have facilitated Guy's social and political advancement whenever he arrived.\n\nRaymond of Tripoli and his ally [[Bohemond III of Antioch]] were preparing to invade the kingdom to force the king to give his older sister [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] in marriage to [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], Amalric's father-in-law. Guy and Sibylla were hastily married at [[Eastertide]], in April 1180, to prevent this coup. By his marriage Guy also became [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] in April 1180, and [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Bailiffs|''bailli'' (Bailiff) of Jerusalem]]. He and Sibylla had two daughters, Alix and Maria. Sibylla already had one child, a son from her first marriage to [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William of Montferrat]].\n\nThe mid-thirteenth century ''Old French Continuation of [[William of Tyre]]'' (formerly attributed to [[Ernoul]]) claims that Agnes advised her son to marry Sibylla to Guy, and that Amalric had brought Guy to Jerusalem specifically for him to marry Sibylla. However, this is improbable: given the speed with which the marriage was arranged, Guy must have already been in the kingdom when the decision was made. With the new King of France, [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], a minor, the chief hope of external aid was Baldwin's first cousin Henry II, who owed the Pope a [[penitential pilgrimage]] on account of the [[Thomas Becket]] affair. Guy was a [[vassal]] of Richard of Poitou and Henry II, and as a formerly rebellious vassal, it was in their interests to keep him overseas.\n\nEarly in 1182, as his health markedly declined, Baldwin IV named Guy regent. However, he and [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] made provocations against [[Saladin]] during a two-year period of truce. But it was his military hesitance at the [[siege of Kerak]] which disillusioned the king with him. Throughout late 1183 and 1184 Baldwin IV tried to have his sister's marriage to Guy annulled, showing that Baldwin still held his sister with some favour. Baldwin IV had wanted a loyal brother-in-law, and was frustrated in Guy's disobedience. Sibylla was in Ascalon with her husband. Unsuccessful in prying his sister and close heir away from Guy, the king and the ''Haute Cour'' altered the succession, placing [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], Sibylla's son from her first marriage, in precedence over Sibylla, and decreeing a process to choose the monarch afterwards between Sibylla and Isabella (whom Baldwin and the Haute Cour thus recognized as at least equally entitled to succession as Sibylla), though she was not herself excluded from the succession. Guy kept a low profile from 1183 until his wife became Queen in 1186.\n\n===King of Jerusalem===\nWhen Baldwin IV finally succumbed to his [[leprosy]] in 1185, Baldwin V became King, but he was a sickly child and died within a year. Guy went with Sibylla to Jerusalem for his stepson's funeral in 1186, along with an armed escort, with which he garrisoned the city. Raymond III, who wanted to protect his own influence and his new political ally, the [[dowager queen]] [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], was making arrangements to summon the ''Haute Cour'' when Sibylla was crowned queen by [[Eraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]]. Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon gained popular support for Sibylla by affirming that she was \"li plus apareissanz et plus dreis heis dou rouame\" (\"the most evident and rightful heir of the kingdom\"). With the clear support of the church Sibylla was undisputed sovereign.\n\nHowever, before she was crowned she agreed with oppositional court members that she would annul her marriage with Guy to please them, as long as she would be given free choice in her next husband. The leaders of the ''Haute Cour'' agreed, and Sibylla was crowned thereafter as queen regnant. Taking her choice as husband, to the astonishment of the rival court faction, she remarried Guy, who became King in August 1186. The Queen removed the crown from her head and handed it to Guy, permitting him to crown himself, at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], in September 1186. As Hamilton writes, \"there could be no doubt after the ceremony that Guy only held the [[crown matrimonial]]\".\n\nSibylla's half-sister [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]] and her husband [[Humphrey IV of Toron]] were Raymond III and the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]]' choice for the throne. As Sibylla's parents marriage had been annulled and both she and Baldwin had been legitimized by the church, Isabella was seen by many as the legal heiress. However, Humphrey would not assert his wife's claim, and he disassociated himself from them, swearing fealty instead to Sibylla. Humphrey would become one of Guy's closest allies in the kingdom.\n\n===Hattin and the fall of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Saladin and Guy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Saladin]] and Guy of Lusignan after Hattin]]\nImmediately after, the chief concern in the kingdom was checking Saladin's advance. In 1187 Guy, under pressure and surrounded by conflicting advice, attempted to relieve Saladin's siege of [[Tiberias]]. Guy's army left the springs of [[Sepphoris#Islamic conquest and the Crusaders|Sepphora]], and marched towards Tiberias to give pitched battle. Stationary, it was surrounded and cut off from a supply of water, and on July 4 the army of Jerusalem was completely destroyed at the [[Battle of Hattin]]. Guy was one of the very few captives spared by the Saracens after the battle, along with his brother Geoffrey, Raynald, and Humphrey.\n\nThe exhausted captives were brought to Saladin's tent, where Guy was given a goblet of water as a sign of Saladin's generosity, for offering a prisoner food or drink was a sign that his life was safe. When Guy offered the goblet to his fellow captive Raynald, Saladin chastised him, indicating his clemency did not extend to Raynald.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Runciman\n  | first = Steven\n  | authorlink =Steven Runciman\n  | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100\u20131187 (Vol. 2)\n  | publisher =Cambridge University Press\n  | location= Cambridge\n  | year = 1952\n  | pages=459\n  | isbn =0-521-34771-8}}</ref> Saladin then accused Raynald of being an oath-breaker, and Raynald replied that \"''kings have always acted thus''\". Saladin proceeded to execute Raynald himself, beheading him with his sword. When Guy was brought in, he fell to his knees at the sight of Raynald's corpse. Saladin bade him to rise, saying, \"A king does not kill a king.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Runciman\n  | first = Steven\n  | authorlink =Steven Runciman\n  | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100\u20131187 (Vol. 2)\n  | publisher =Cambridge University Press\n  | location= Cambridge\n  | year = 1952\n  | pages=460\n  | isbn =0-521-34771-8}}</ref>\n\nGuy was imprisoned in [[Damascus]], while Sibylla together with [[Balian of Ibelin]] remained behind to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|defend Jerusalem]], which was handed over to Saladin on 2 October. Sibylla wrote to Saladin and begged for her husband's release, and Guy was finally granted release in 1188 and allowed to rejoin his wife. Guy and Sibylla sought refuge in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the only city remaining in [[Christians|Christian]] hands, thanks to the defence of [[Conrad of Montferrat]] (younger brother of Sibylla's first husband).\n\n===Guy versus Conrad===\n[[Image:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|250px|15th century illuminated manuscript of ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]: [[Richard I]] authorizes Guy of Lusignan to gain Cyprus.]]\nConrad denied sanctuary to Sibylla and Guy, who camped outside the city walls for months. Guy then took the initiative, beginning the [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|siege of Acre]] in anticipation of the arrival of the vanguard of the [[Third Crusade]]. The queen followed him but died during an epidemic in the summer of 1190, along with their young daughters. According to the surviving members of the ''Haute Cour'', with Sibylla's death Guy lost the authority he held as her husband, and the crown passed to Isabella. The Ibelins hastily divorced Isabella from Humphrey, and married her to Conrad, who now claimed the kingship. However, Guy continued to demand recognition as king.\n\nIn 1191, Guy left Acre with a small fleet and landed at [[Limassol]] to seek support from [[Richard I of England]], whose vassal he had been in Poitou. He swore fealty to King Richard, and attended his wedding to [[Berengaria of Navarre]]. He participated in the campaign against [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus]]. In return for this, when Richard arrived at Acre, he supported Guy against Conrad, who had the support of his kinsmen [[Philip II of France]] and [[Leopold V of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold V of Austria]].\n\nThe conflict continued throughout the siege of Acre, although it did not deter Guy from gallantly saving Conrad's life when he was surrounded by the enemy. A temporary settlement was then reached by which Guy was to remain king in his lifetime, but to be succeeded by Conrad and Isabella or their heirs. However, in April 1192 Richard finally realised that he could not return home without a final resolution to the matter, definitely relinquishing the crown in May 1192. The kingship was put to a vote among the barons of the kingdom: Conrad was elected unanimously, and Guy accepted defeat. Only days later, Conrad was assassinated by [[Hashashin|Assassins]], and Isabella married Richard's nephew [[Henry II of Champagne]]; when he died in 1197, Isabella married Guy's brother Amalric.\n\n===Lord of Cyprus===\nMeanwhile, Guy was compensated for the loss of his kingdom by purchasing [[Cyprus]] from the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] in 1192, who had themselves purchased it from Richard, who had wrested it from [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] ''en route'' to Palestine. [[File:Coin issued by Guy de Lusignan during when he was Lord of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|The coin reads REX GVIDO D on the inverse. On the reverse EIERVSALEM is inscribed around the Holy Sepulchre, showing Guy's reluctance to abandon his claim to Jerusalem.]]Technically Guy was Lord of Cyprus, it not yet being a kingdom, and used the royal title (if at all) as a remnant from Jerusalem, which was not held fully legally. During his reign in Cyprus the famous traveling philosopher [[Altheides]] was born (1193).\n\n===Death===\nGuy died in 1194 without surviving issue (his daughters by Sibylla, Alix and Marie, both died young of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in September or 21 October 1190) and was succeeded by his brother [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]], who received the royal crown from [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The House of Lusignan continued to rule the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] until 1474. Guy was buried at the [[Church of the Templars (Nicosia)|Church of the Templars]] in [[Nicosia]].\n[[File:Armoiries Chypre J\u00e9rusalem.svg|thumb|150px|Coat-of-arms of Lusignan of Cyprus and Jerusalem]]\n\n==In fiction and film==\nGuy appears as main character in a tale of ''[[Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]],<ref>[[Decameron]]'', [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (day 1, tale 9)</ref> where the [[censure]] of a [[Gascony|Gascon]] lady converts the King of [[Cyprus]] from a churlish to an honourable temper.\n\n[[Sir Walter Scott]], in ''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802\u20131803), recounts the legend of [[Melusine|Melusina]], a supernatural creature\n\n<blockquote>who married Guy de Lusignan, Count of Poitou, under condition that he should never attempt to intrude upon her privacy.... She bore the count many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her magical art. Their harmony was uninterrupted until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, by concealing himself to behold his wife make use of her enchanted bath. Hardly had Melusina discovered the indiscreet intruder, than, transforming herself into a [[dragon]], she departed with a loud yell of lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even in the days of Brantome, she was supposed to be the protectress of her descendants, and was heard wailing as she sailed upon the blast round the turrets of the castle of Lusignan the night before it was demolished.</blockquote>\n\nGuy has also appeared in a number of [[historical novel]]s, including [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]'s ''Kr\u00f3l tr\u0119dowaty'' (''The Leper King''), [[Graham Shelby]]'s ''The Knights of Dark Renown'', and [[Cecelia Holland]]'s ''Jerusalem'', generally as a good-looking but weak and foolish young man. [[Ronald Welch]] in ''[[Knight Crusader]]'' and [[Jean Plaidy]] ([[Eleanor Hibbert]]) in ''The Heart of the Lion'' both depict him sympathetically as likable and chivalrous. Both give the misleading impression that he was younger than King Richard: he was at least several years older.\n\nIn the historical ''[[The Knight Templar (Crusades trilogy)|Knights Templar Trilogy]]'' by the Swedish author [[Jan Guillou]], Guy is depicted as a scheming, incompetent, and selfish villain accelerating the loss of the Holy Land to [[Saladin]].\n\nGuy is portrayed as a peace-loving elderly man, goaded into war by Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon, in [[Egypt]]ian director [[Youssef Chahine]]'s 1963 film ''[[Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din (film)|Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din]]''. \n\nAnother fictionalised version of him\u2014as an arrogant, scheming villain (and a Templar)\u2014is portrayed by [[Marton Csokas]] in the 2005 movie ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]''. The film distorts his relationship with Sibylla, which seems to have been one of mutual loyalty; it also implies that he was her only husband, though this is corrected in the director's cut of the film.\n\nA character named 'Guy' appears in ''[[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]]'', played by [[Aneurin Barnard]]; he serves as squire to [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]] ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]])\u2014in the sequel ''Battle for Blood'', set five years after the events of the first film, he is played by [[Tom Austen]]\u2014and his name is revealed to be 'Guy De Lusignan'\u2014it is unlikely that he is the historical Guy, who lived in the mid to late 12th century.\n \nThe first film is set during the [[Baron's War]] (1215\u20131217)\u2014at the end of 'Battle for Blood', it states that Guy went on to fight in the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453). This is clearly impossible, as that war began in 1337\u2014and the film is set five years after the [[Siege of Rochester Castle]] (1215)\u2014a gap of some 117 years.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n| 1=  1.

He was king of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] from 1186 to 1192 [[Jure uxoris|by right of marriage]] to [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]], and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] from 1192 to 1194. Having arrived in the [[Holy Land]] (where his brother [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery of Lusignan]] was already prominent) at an unknown date, Guy was hastily married to Sibylla in 1180 to prevent a political incident within the kingdom. As the health of his brother-in-law, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], deteriorated, Guy was appointed [[regent]] for his stepson by Sibylla, [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]]. Baldwin IV died in 1185, followed shortly by Baldwin V in 1186, leading to the succession of Sibylla and Guy to the throne. Guy's reign was marked by increased hostilities with the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] ruled by [[Saladin]], culminating in the [[Battle of Hattin]] in July 1187\u2014during which Guy was captured\u2014and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] itself three months later.\n\nFollowing a year of imprisonment in [[Damascus]], Guy was released by Saladin. After being denied entry to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], one of the last crusader strongholds, by [[Conrad of Montferrat]], Guy [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|besieged Acre]] in 1189. The siege, during which Guy's wife died, developed into a rallying point for the [[Third Crusade]], led by [[Philip II of France]] and [[Richard I of England]]. Guy entered a bitter row with Conrad over the kingship of Jerusalem; despite Richard's support for the widower king, Conrad married Sibylla's half-sister [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella]] and was elected king by the nobility of the kingdom. Conrad was assassinated by [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] days after the election; Richard's and Guy's involvement in the incident is suspected, but unproven. Nevertheless, Guy was compensated for the dispossession of his crown by being given lordship of Cyprus in 1192, which Richard had taken from the [[Byzantine Empire]] en route to the Levant. Guy ruled the Kingdom of Cyprus until his death in 1194, when he was succeeded by his brother [[Aimery of Cyprus|Amalric]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Political rise===\nGuy was a son of Lord [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan|Hugh VIII]] of [[Lusignan]], in [[Poitou]], at that time a part of the French duchy of [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], held by [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Queen Eleanor]] of England, her third son [[Richard I of England|Richard]], and her husband the English King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].\n\nIn 1168 Guy and his brothers ambushed and killed [[Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], who was returning from a [[pilgrimage]]. They were banished from Poitou by their overlord, Richard I, then (acting) [[Duke of Aquitaine]].\n\nGuy went to Jerusalem at some date between 1173 and 1180,<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 157 and notes 127 and 128</ref> initially as a pilgrim or Crusader; [[Bernard Hamilton]] suggests that he may have arrived with the French Crusaders of 1179.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 157 and note 126</ref> In 1174, his older brother [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]] had married the daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]] and entered court circles. Amalric had also obtained the patronage of King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and of his mother [[Agnes of Courtenay]] who held the [[county of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and was married to [[Reginald of Sidon]]. He was appointed Agnes's Constable in Jaffa, and later [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|Constable]] of the Kingdom. Later, hostile rumours alleged he was Agnes's lover, but this is questionable. It is likely that his promotions were aimed at weaning him away from the political orbit of the [[Ibelin family]], who were associated with [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]]'s cousin and the former [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Bailiffs|''bailli'' or regent]]. Amalric of Lusignan's success is likely to have facilitated Guy's social and political advancement whenever he arrived.\n\nRaymond of Tripoli and his ally [[Bohemond III of Antioch]] were preparing to invade the kingdom to force the king to give his older sister [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] in marriage to [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], Amalric's father-in-law. Guy and Sibylla were hastily married at [[Eastertide]], in April 1180, to prevent this coup. By his marriage Guy also became [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] in April 1180, and [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Bailiffs|''bailli'' (Bailiff) of Jerusalem]]. He and Sibylla had two daughters, Alix and Maria. Sibylla already had one child, a son from her first marriage to [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William of Montferrat]].\n\nThe mid-thirteenth century ''Old French Continuation of [[William of Tyre]]'' (formerly attributed to [[Ernoul]]) claims that Agnes advised her son to marry Sibylla to Guy, and that Amalric had brought Guy to Jerusalem specifically for him to marry Sibylla. However, this is improbable: given the speed with which the marriage was arranged, Guy must have already been in the kingdom when the decision was made. With the new King of France, [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], a minor, the chief hope of external aid was Baldwin's first cousin Henry II, who owed the Pope a [[penitential pilgrimage]] on account of the [[Thomas Becket]] affair. Guy was a [[vassal]] of Richard of Poitou and Henry II, and as a formerly rebellious vassal, it was in their interests to keep him overseas.\n\nEarly in 1182, as his health markedly declined, Baldwin IV named Guy regent. However, he and [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] made provocations against [[Saladin]] during a two-year period of truce. But it was his military hesitance at the [[siege of Kerak]] which disillusioned the king with him. Throughout late 1183 and 1184 Baldwin IV tried to have his sister's marriage to Guy annulled, showing that Baldwin still held his sister with some favour. Baldwin IV had wanted a loyal brother-in-law, and was frustrated in Guy's disobedience. Sibylla was in Ascalon with her husband. Unsuccessful in prying his sister and close heir away from Guy, the king and the ''Haute Cour'' altered the succession, placing [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], Sibylla's son from her first marriage, in precedence over Sibylla, and decreeing a process to choose the monarch afterwards between Sibylla and Isabella (whom Baldwin and the Haute Cour thus recognized as at least equally entitled to succession as Sibylla), though she was not herself excluded from the succession. Guy kept a low profile from 1183 until his wife became Queen in 1186.\n\n===King of Jerusalem===\nWhen Baldwin IV finally succumbed to his [[leprosy]] in 1185, Baldwin V became King, but he was a sickly child and died within a year. Guy went with Sibylla to Jerusalem for his stepson's funeral in 1186, along with an armed escort, with which he garrisoned the city. Raymond III, who wanted to protect his own influence and his new political ally, the [[dowager queen]] [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], was making arrangements to summon the ''Haute Cour'' when Sibylla was crowned queen by [[Eraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]]. Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon gained popular support for Sibylla by affirming that she was \"li plus apareissanz et plus dreis heis dou rouame\" (\"the most evident and rightful heir of the kingdom\"). With the clear support of the church Sibylla was undisputed sovereign.\n\nHowever, before she was crowned she agreed with oppositional court members that she would annul her marriage with Guy to please them, as long as she would be given free choice in her next husband. The leaders of the ''Haute Cour'' agreed, and Sibylla was crowned thereafter as queen regnant. Taking her choice as husband, to the astonishment of the rival court faction, she remarried Guy, who became King in August 1186. The Queen removed the crown from her head and handed it to Guy, permitting him to crown himself, at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], in September 1186. As Hamilton writes, \"there could be no doubt after the ceremony that Guy only held the [[crown matrimonial]]\".\n\nSibylla's half-sister [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]] and her husband [[Humphrey IV of Toron]] were Raymond III and the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]]' choice for the throne. As Sibylla's parents marriage had been annulled and both she and Baldwin had been legitimized by the church, Isabella was seen by many as the legal heiress. However, Humphrey would not assert his wife's claim, and he disassociated himself from them, swearing fealty instead to Sibylla. Humphrey would become one of Guy's closest allies in the kingdom.\n\n===Hattin and the fall of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Saladin and Guy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Saladin]] and Guy of Lusignan after Hattin]]\nImmediately after, the chief concern in the kingdom was checking Saladin's advance. In 1187 Guy, under pressure and surrounded by conflicting advice, attempted to relieve Saladin's siege of [[Tiberias]]. Guy's army left the springs of [[Sepphoris#Islamic conquest and the Crusaders|Sepphora]], and marched towards Tiberias to give pitched battle. Stationary, it was surrounded and cut off from a supply of water, and on July 4 the army of Jerusalem was completely destroyed at the [[Battle of Hattin]]. Guy was one of the very few captives spared by the Saracens after the battle, along with his brother Geoffrey, Raynald, and Humphrey.\n\nThe exhausted captives were brought to Saladin's tent, where Guy was given a goblet of water as a sign of Saladin's generosity, for offering a prisoner food or drink was a sign that his life was safe. When Guy offered the goblet to his fellow captive Raynald, Saladin chastised him, indicating his clemency did not extend to Raynald.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Runciman\n  | first = Steven\n  | authorlink =Steven Runciman\n  | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100\u20131187 (Vol. 2)\n  | publisher =Cambridge University Press\n  | location= Cambridge\n  | year = 1952\n  | pages=459\n  | isbn =0-521-34771-8}}</ref> Saladin then accused Raynald of being an oath-breaker, and Raynald replied that \"''kings have always acted thus''\". Saladin proceeded to execute Raynald himself, beheading him with his sword. When Guy was brought in, he fell to his knees at the sight of Raynald's corpse. Saladin bade him to rise, saying, \"A king does not kill a king.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Runciman\n  | first = Steven\n  | authorlink =Steven Runciman\n  | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100\u20131187 (Vol. 2)\n  | publisher =Cambridge University Press\n  | location= Cambridge\n  | year = 1952\n  | pages=460\n  | isbn =0-521-34771-8}}</ref>\n\nGuy was imprisoned in [[Damascus]], while Sibylla together with [[Balian of Ibelin]] remained behind to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|defend Jerusalem]], which was handed over to Saladin on 2 October. Sibylla wrote to Saladin and begged for her husband's release, and Guy was finally granted release in 1188 and allowed to rejoin his wife. Guy and Sibylla sought refuge in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the only city remaining in [[Christians|Christian]] hands, thanks to the defence of [[Conrad of Montferrat]] (younger brother of Sibylla's first husband).\n\n===Guy versus Conrad===\n[[Image:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|250px|15th century illuminated manuscript of ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]: [[Richard I]] authorizes Guy of Lusignan to gain Cyprus.]]\nConrad denied sanctuary to Sibylla and Guy, who camped outside the city walls for months. Guy then took the initiative, beginning the [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|siege of Acre]] in anticipation of the arrival of the vanguard of the [[Third Crusade]]. The queen followed him but died during an epidemic in the summer of 1190, along with their young daughters. According to the surviving members of the ''Haute Cour'', with Sibylla's death Guy lost the authority he held as her husband, and the crown passed to Isabella. The Ibelins hastily divorced Isabella from Humphrey, and married her to Conrad, who now claimed the kingship. However, Guy continued to demand recognition as king.\n\nIn 1191, Guy left Acre with a small fleet and landed at [[Limassol]] to seek support from [[Richard I of England]], whose vassal he had been in Poitou. He swore fealty to King Richard, and attended his wedding to [[Berengaria of Navarre]]. He participated in the campaign against [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus]]. In return for this, when Richard arrived at Acre, he supported Guy against Conrad, who had the support of his kinsmen [[Philip II of France]] and [[Leopold V of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold V of Austria]].\n\nThe conflict continued throughout the siege of Acre, although it did not deter Guy from gallantly saving Conrad's life when he was surrounded by the enemy. A temporary settlement was then reached by which Guy was to remain king in his lifetime, but to be succeeded by Conrad and Isabella or their heirs. However, in April 1192 Richard finally realised that he could not return home without a final resolution to the matter, definitely relinquishing the crown in May 1192. The kingship was put to a vote among the barons of the kingdom: Conrad was elected unanimously, and Guy accepted defeat. Only days later, Conrad was assassinated by [[Hashashin|Assassins]], and Isabella married Richard's nephew [[Henry II of Champagne]]; when he died in 1197, Isabella married Guy's brother Amalric.\n\n===Lord of Cyprus===\nMeanwhile, Guy was compensated for the loss of his kingdom by purchasing [[Cyprus]] from the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] in 1192, who had themselves purchased it from Richard, who had wrested it from [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] ''en route'' to Palestine.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller in heels  than an individual male.

There are also differences in the structure of specific areas of the [[Human brain|brain]].

Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller than an individual male.

The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.

It occurs in several well-characterized stages. The initial signal comes from tissue areas that are devoid of vasculature. The hypoxia that is noted in these areas causes the tissues to demand the presence of nutrients and oxygen that will allow the tissue to carry out metabolic activities. Because of this, parenchymal cells will secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ([[VEGF-A]]) which is a proangiogenic growth factor.<ref>Adair TH, Montani JP. Angiogenesis. San Rafael (CA): Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences; 2010. Chapter 1, Overview of Angiogenesis. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53238/</ref>  These biological signals activate [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on [[endothelial cell]]s present in pre-existing blood vessels.  Second, the activated endothelial cells, also known as tip cells, begin to release [[enzyme]]s called [[protease]]s that degrade the [[basement membrane]] to allow endothelial cells to escape from the original (parent) vessel walls. The [[endothelial cell]]s then [[cell growth|proliferate]] into the surrounding [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] and form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. The cells that are proliferating are located behind the tip cells and are known as stalk cells. The proliferation of these cells allows the capillary sprout to grow in length simultaneously.\n\nAs sprouts extend toward the source of the angiogenic stimulus, endothelial cells migrate in [[tandem]], using adhesion molecules called [[integrin]]s.  These sprouts then form loops to become a full-fledged vessel [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] as cells migrate to the site of angiogenesis. Sprouting occurs at a rate of several millimeters per day, and enables new vessels to grow across gaps in the [[vasculature]]. It is markedly different from splitting angiogenesis because it forms entirely new vessels as opposed to splitting existing vessels.\n\n===Intussusceptive angiogenesis===\n{{main|Intussusceptive angiogenesis}}\n[[Intussusceptive angiogenesis]], also known as ''splitting angiogenesis'', is the formation of a new blood vessel by splitting an existing blood vessel into two.\n\nIntussusception was first observed in [[neonatal]] rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the [[endothelial]] [[cell junction]]s are reorganized and the vessel [[bilayer]] is [[perforated]] to allow [[growth factors]] and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with [[pericyte]]s and [[myofibroblast]]s. These cells begin laying [[collagen]] fibers into the core to provide an [[extracellular matrix]] for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of [[capillaries]] without a corresponding increase in the number of [[endothelial cell]]s. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich [[Microcirculation|microvasculature]] with new cells every time a new vessel develops.<ref name=\"Burri2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Burri PH, Hlushchuk R, Djonov V | title = Intussusceptive angiogenesis: its emergence, its characteristics, and its significance | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 231 | issue = 3 | pages = 474\u201388 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15376313 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.20184 }}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n\n===Mechanical stimulation===\nMechanical stimulation of angiogenesis is not well characterized.

Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the [[mRNA]] production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis.

In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or [[metastasis]]. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of [[circulating tumor cell]]s in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allard WJ, Matera J, Miller MC, Repollet M, Connelly MC, Rao C, Tibbe AG, Uhr JW, Terstappen LW | title = Tumor cells circulate in the peripheral blood of all major carcinomas but not in healthy subjects or patients with nonmalignant diseases | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 10 | issue = 20 | pages = 6897\u2013904 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15501967 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0378 }}</ref> The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and [[oxygen]] and a waste disposal pathway.\n\nEndothelial cells have long been considered genetically more stable than cancer cells. This genomic stability confers an advantage to targeting endothelial cells using antiangiogenic therapy, compared to [[chemotherapy]] directed at cancer cells, which rapidly mutate and acquire '[[drug resistance]]' to treatment.

Angiogenic stimulators are then released by the tumor cells. These then travel to already established, nearby blood vessels and activates their endothelial cell receptors. This induces a release of [[proteolytic]] enzymes from the vasculature. These enzymes target a particular point on the blood vessel and cause a pore to form. This is the point where the new blood vessel will grow from. The reason tumour cells need a blood supply is because they cannot grow any more than 2-3 millimeters in diameter without an established blood supply which is equivalent to about 50-100 cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishida N, Yano H, Nishida T, Kamura T, Kojiro M | title = Angiogenesis in cancer | journal = Vascular Health and Risk Management | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 213\u20139 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17326328 | pmc = 1993983 | doi=10.2147/vhrm.2006.2.3.213}}</ref>\n\n===Angiogenesis for cardiovascular disease===\nAngiogenesis represents an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hariawala MD, Sellke FW | title = Angiogenesis and the heart: therapeutic implications | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 90 | issue = 6 | pages = 307\u201311 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9227376 | pmc = 1296305 | doi = 10.1177/014107689709000604 }}</ref>\n\nThese failures suggested that either these are the wrong molecular targets to induce neovascularization, that they can only be effectively used if formulated and administered correctly, or that their [[presentation]] in the context of the overall cellular microenvironment may play a vital role in their utility.

While [[arteriogenesis]] produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.<ref name=\"Prior2004\" />\n\n===Macular degeneration===\nOverexpression of VEGF causes increased permeability in blood vessels in addition to stimulating angiogenesis.

The hypoxia that is noted in these areas causes the tissues to demand the presence of nutrients and oxygen that will allow the tissue to carry out metabolic activities. Because of this, parenchymal cells will secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ([[VEGF-A]]) which is a proangiogenic growth factor.<ref>Adair TH, Montani JP. Angiogenesis.

Second, the activated endothelial cells, also known as tip cells, begin to release [[enzyme]]s called [[protease]]s that degrade the [[basement membrane]] to allow endothelial cells to escape from the original (parent) vessel walls. The [[endothelial cell]]s then [[cell growth|proliferate]] into the surrounding [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] and form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. The cells that are proliferating are located behind the tip cells and are known as stalk cells. The proliferation of these cells allows the capillary sprout to grow in length simultaneously.\n\nAs sprouts extend toward the source of the angiogenic stimulus, endothelial cells migrate in [[tandem]], using adhesion molecules called [[integrin]]s.  These sprouts then form loops to become a full-fledged vessel [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] as cells migrate to the site of angiogenesis. Sprouting occurs at a rate of several millimeters per day, and enables new vessels to grow across gaps in the [[vasculature]]. It is markedly different from splitting angiogenesis because it forms entirely new vessels as opposed to splitting existing vessels.\n\n===Intussusceptive angiogenesis===\n{{main|Intussusceptive angiogenesis}}\n[[Intussusceptive angiogenesis]], also known as ''splitting angiogenesis'', is the formation of a new blood vessel by splitting an existing blood vessel into two.\n\nIntussusception was first observed in [[neonatal]] rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the [[endothelial]] [[cell junction]]s are reorganized and the vessel [[bilayer]] is [[perforated]] to allow [[growth factors]] and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with [[pericyte]]s and [[myofibroblast]]s. These cells begin laying [[collagen]] fibers into the core to provide an [[extracellular matrix]] for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of [[capillaries]] without a corresponding increase in the number of [[endothelial cell]]s. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich [[Microcirculation|microvasculature]] with new cells every time a new vessel develops.<ref name=\"Burri2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Burri PH, Hlushchuk R, Djonov V | title = Intussusceptive angiogenesis: its emergence, its characteristics, and its significance | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 231 | issue = 3 | pages = 474\u201388 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15376313 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.20184 }}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n\n===Mechanical stimulation===\nMechanical stimulation of angiogenesis is not well characterized.

Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the [[mRNA]] production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis. As part of the angiogenic signaling cascade, NO is widely considered to be a major contributor to the angiogenic response because inhibition of NO significantly reduces the effects of angiogenic growth factors.

This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of [[circulating tumor cell]]s in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allard WJ, Matera J, Miller MC, Repollet M, Connelly MC, Rao C, Tibbe AG, Uhr JW, Terstappen LW | title = Tumor cells circulate in the peripheral blood of all major carcinomas but not in healthy subjects or patients with nonmalignant diseases | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 10 | issue = 20 | pages = 6897\u2013904 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15501967 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0378 }}</ref> The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and [[oxygen]] and a waste disposal pathway.\n\nEndothelial cells have long been considered genetically more stable than cancer cells. This genomic stability confers an advantage to targeting endothelial cells using antiangiogenic therapy, compared to [[chemotherapy]] directed at cancer cells, which rapidly mutate and acquire '[[drug resistance]]' to treatment.  For this reason, [[endothelial cells]] are thought to be an ideal target for therapies directed against them.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bagri A, Kouros-Mehr H, Leong KG, Plowman GD | title = Use of anti-VEGF adjuvant therapy in cancer: challenges and rationale | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 122\u201332 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20189876 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2010.01.004 }}</ref>\n\n===Formation of tumor blood vessels===\nThe mechanism of blood vessel formation by angiogenesis is initiated by the spontaneous dividing of tumor cells due to a mutation. Angiogenic stimulators are then released by the tumor cells. These then travel to already established, nearby blood vessels and activates their endothelial cell receptors. This induces a release of [[proteolytic]] enzymes from the vasculature. These enzymes target a particular point on the blood vessel and cause a pore to form. This is the point where the new blood vessel will grow from. The reason tumour cells need a blood supply is because they cannot grow any more than 2-3 millimeters in diameter without an established blood supply which is equivalent to about 50-100 cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishida N, Yano H, Nishida T, Kamura T, Kojiro M | title = Angiogenesis in cancer | journal = Vascular Health and Risk Management | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 213\u20139 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17326328 | pmc = 1993983 | doi=10.2147/vhrm.2006.2.3.213}}</ref>\n\n===Angiogenesis for cardiovascular disease===\nAngiogenesis represents an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult.<ref name=\"Stegmann\"/> A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hariawala MD, Sellke FW | title = Angiogenesis and the heart: therapeutic implications | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 90 | issue = 6 | pages = 307\u201311 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9227376 | pmc = 1296305 | doi = 10.1177/014107689709000604 }}</ref>\n\nThese failures suggested that either these are the wrong molecular targets to induce neovascularization, that they can only be effectively used if formulated and administered correctly, or that their [[presentation]] in the context of the overall cellular microenvironment may play a vital role in their utility.

While [[arteriogenesis]] produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.<ref name=\"Prior2004\" />\n\n===Macular degeneration===\nOverexpression of VEGF causes increased permeability in blood vessels in addition to stimulating angiogenesis. In wet [[macular degeneration]], VEGF causes proliferation of capillaries into the retina. Since the increase in angiogenesis also causes [[edema]], blood and other retinal fluids leak into the [[retina]], causing loss of vision. Anti-angiogenic drugs targeting the VEGF pathways are now used successfully to treat this type of macular degeneration\n\n===Tissue engineered constructs===\nAngiogenesis of vessels from the host body into an implanted tissue engineered constructs is essential. Successful integration is often dependent on thorough vascularisation of the construct as it provides oxygen and nutrients and prevents necrosis in the central  areas  of  the  implant.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rouwkema |first1=Jeroen |last2=Khademhosseini |first2=Ali |title=Vascularization and Angiogenesis in Tissue Engineering: Beyond Creating Static Networks |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |date=September 2016 |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=733\u2013745 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.03.002|pmid=27032730 }}</ref>  PDGF has been shown to stabilize vascularisation in collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Amaral |first1=Ronaldo Jose Farias Correa |last2=Cavanagh |first2=Brenton |last3=O'Brien |first3=Fergal Joseph |last4=Kearney |first4=Cathal John |title=Platelet\u2010derived growth factor stabilises vascularisation in collagen\u2010glycosaminoglycan scaffolds |journal=Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=261\u2013273 |date=16 December 2018 |doi=10.1002/term.2789|pmid=30554484 }}</ref>\n\n==Quantification==\nQuantifying vasculature parameters such as microvascular density has various complications due to preferential staining or limited representation of tissues by histological sections.

The [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] was created on 21 April 1758 from the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=LG31583/> In 1881, under the [[Childers Reforms]], the 64th Regiment of Foot was merged with the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]] (originally raised in 1824) to form the '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment)'''. In 1921 the regimental title was altered to the '''North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)'''.\n\nFormed at a time when the [[British Empire]] was reaching its peak, the regiment served all over the Empire, in times of both peace and war, and in many theatres of war outside the Empire. It fought with distinction in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], as well as in other smaller conflicts around the world. These other wars included the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]], the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]].\n\nIn 1959, as part of a defence review, the North Staffordshire Regiment, by now reduced to only a single regular battalion, was amalgamated with the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]] to form the [[Staffordshire Regiment|Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)]] which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] to form the [[Mercian Regiment]]. Today the traditions of the North Staffordshire Regiment are continued by the [[Mercian Regiment]].\n\n==Formation history==\n{{Main|64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot|98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot}}\n\nThe '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment''' was formed under the [[Childers Reforms]] on 1 July 1881, by the amalgamation of the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] and [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} These two regular regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the new regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} The [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Rifle Volunteers]] forces of North Staffordshire were also incorporated into this new regiment, and a permanent [[Regimental depot|depot]] was established at [[Whittington Barracks]], [[Lichfield]], which also housed the newly formed [[South Staffordshire Regiment]].{{sfn|The brief history of the Staffordshire Regiment, part 1|2010|p=3}}\n\nThe 64th Regiment of Foot was originally raised in 1756 as the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th (Devonshire) Foot]], and was renumbered the 64th in 1758. It had a long history of overseas service with much less time spent in Europe. It had served in the [[West Indies]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], America during the [[American War of Independence]], South America, the West Indies and Canada during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Subsequent long periods were spent in Ireland and the West Indies before action was seen in India during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. At the time of the forming of the amalgamation with the 98th Foot, the 64th was based in Ireland.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe 98th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1824 in [[Chichester]], had a much shorter history, but like the 64th had spent the majority of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the [[First Opium War|First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War]] and India on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]]. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe battalions that constituted the regiment in 1881 were as follows:\n\n* 1st Battalion: the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 2nd Battalion: the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 3rd (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (2nd Staffordshire) Light Infantry Militia, based in [[Stafford]];\n* 4th (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (3rd Staffordshire) Rifles Militia, based in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]];\n* 1st Volunteer Battalion: 2nd Staffordshire ([[Staffordshire Rangers]]) Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]];\n* 2nd Volunteer Battalion: 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in Lichfield but later moved to [[Burton-on-Trent]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}}\n\n==Volunteers and Territorials==\nThe 2nd and 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps were designated the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions, North Staffordshire Regiment, in 1883. Together with the Volunteer battalions of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], they formed the [[Staffordshire Brigade|Staffordshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade]] in 1888. This brigade was intended to assemble at [[Wolverhampton]] in time of war, while in peacetime it acted as a focus for collective training of the Volunteers. On the formation of the [[Territorial Force]] in 1908, the two Volunteer battalions were renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions of the North Staffordshire Regiment, forming part of the Staffordshire Brigade in the [[46th (North Midland) Division|North Midland Division]].{{sfn|Westlake|2010|pages=217\u201322}}{{sfn|Becke|2007|pages=61\u201367}}\n\nThe reserve battalions of the regiment were also reorganised in 1908 by the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]], with the two [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] battalions being re-designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (Special Reserve) battalions, and the volunteer battalions being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions (TF): they were based at [[College Road drill hall, Hanley|College Road]] in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]] and [[Horninglow Street drill hall, Burton upon Trent|Horninglow Street]] in [[Burton upon Trent]] respectively.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=72}}\n\n==Early service (1881\u20131914)==\n\n===Garrison duties and the Mahdist War===\n[[File:North Staffordshire Regiment Officers.jpg|thumb|300px|Officers of the 2nd Battalion, India 1908]]\nThe 1st Battalion was stationed in Ireland at the time of the amalgamation. It moved to England in 1883, and the following year to the [[West Indies]], based mainly in [[Barbados]], but with detachments on other islands. It moved to [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in 1887, to [[Mauritius]] in 1890, to [[Malta]] in 1893 and to [[Egypt]] in 1895.

In September the battalion took part in the action against the [[Dervish]] Army at Hafir, which was decisive in ending the campaign. As a result, the North Staffordshire Regiment received the unique \"Hafir\" [[battle honour]], given to no other British regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=71}}{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=64}}\n\n===Second Boer War===\nThe 2nd Battalion was stationed in [[British Raj|India]] in 1881 when the North Staffordshire Regiment was formed, and remained there until 1886.

In January 1900 [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], commander of the British forces in South Africa, ordered that every infantry battalion in South Africa was to raise a company of mounted infantry. These companies were to be detached from their parent units and operate as part of eight independent mounted infantry battalions.{{sfn|Badsey|2008|p=97}} The North Staffords company thus formed became part of the 8th Battalion, Mounted Infantry. This unit was involved in the pursuit of [[Koos de la Rey]] and was present when he was captured at [[Wildfontein]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=76}} The militia and volunteer battalions also saw service in the Second Boer War. The 4th Battalion was deployed in the Cape Colony and later the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] before being replaced by the 3rd Battalion.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=77\u201378}} Additionally, the two volunteer companies which formed from the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions served alongside the 2nd Battalion at various times.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=78}} As a result of these contributions and those of the two regular battalions, the regiment was awarded the \"South Africa 1900\u20131902\" battle honour.{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=69}}\n\nAt the war's end in June 1902, the 2nd battalion returned to England on the SS ''Galeka'' in October that year,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Troops returning home| day_of_week=Wednesday |date=24 September 1902 |page_number=7 |issue=36881}}</ref> but the home posting was brief.

On joining the Territorial Force men were asked if they would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively.{{sfn|Baker|2009|loc=[http://www.1914-1918.net/tf.htm The Territorial Force 1914\u20131918]}}{{sfn|Beckett|1991|p=229}}\n\nThe battalions that served in France took part in many of the major actions of the war including the 1915 [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], the 1915 [[Battle of Loos]], the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]] in 1917 and the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] in 1918.{{sfn|Cook|1970|loc=Chapter 10}}\n\n[[File:North Staffs 1 Bn officers 1914.jpg|thumb|300px|Officers of the 1st Battalion, photographed in Cambridge in August 1914, shortly before embarking for France on 8 September.

Accordingly, the 1st Battalion left India to take part in a ceremony officially amalgamating with the 2nd Battalion in Egypt in 1948.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=120}}  The new 1st Battalion remained in Egypt until 1950, when it returned to the depot in Staffordshire. A year later, the battalion was posted to the disputed port city of [[Trieste]]. In 1953, the battalion was transferred to [[South Korea|Korea]], where they were stationed on garrison duties as part of the [[United Nations]] force established at the end of the [[Korean War]]. In 1954, it moved to Hong Kong, where the regiment's 200th anniversary was celebrated in 1956.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=129}}\n\n==Amalgamation==\nIn July 1957, a [[1957 Defence White Paper|defence review]] was announced, which resulted in the amalgamation of the North Staffordshire Regiment with the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], with the new regiment becoming part of the new administrative [[Mercian Brigade]]. The amalgamation of the 1st Battalions of the two regiments took place on 31 January 1959 at [[Minden, Germany]], to form the 1st Battalion, '''[[Staffordshire Regiment|Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's)]]'''.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=122}}\n\nIn 1947, 41 Searchlight Regiment was reformed in the Territorial Army as 576 (5th Bn, The North Staffordshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment RA (TA), later becoming 576 Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment (576 LAA/SL). When AA Command was disbanded in 1955 and the number of air defence units reduced, 576 LAA/SL Regiment was amalgamated with [[Lancashire Hussars|349 (Lancashire Yeomanry) LAA]] and [[93rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|493 Heavy Anti-Aircraft]] Regiments as 441 LAA/SL Regiment.{{sfn|Litchfield|1992|p=32}}\n\nThe 6th Battalion continued as a Territorial unit of the new regiment without a change of title. In 1961, it merged with the 441st Light Anti Aircraft Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], the successor to the 5th North Staffords, to become the 5th/6th Battalion.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=124}} The combined battalion was abolished in 1967 on the creation of the [[Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve]] in 1967.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=124}}\n\nThe Staffordshire Regiment only had a separate existence from 1959\u20132007. As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, [[Delivering Security in a Changing World]], the regiment was merged with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment]] to form the [[Mercian Regiment]]. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 in Tamworth Castle Grounds, when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-27988491 |title=Mercian Regiment: Final marches for disbanded battalion |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2015 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Regimental museum==\nThe [[Staffordshire Regiment Museum]] is based at [[Whittington Barracks]] near [[Lichfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staffordshireregimentmuseum.com/ |title=No frills but plenty of guts|publisher=The Staffordshire Regiment Museum|accessdate= 22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Battle honours==\nThe following lists all battle honours awarded to the Regiment or inherited by the regiment from the 64th Foot and 98th Foot.{{sfn|Cook|1970|loc=various}}\n\nPrior to 1914 all battle honours awarded to a unit were displayed upon the colours.{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=9}} However the number of battle honours awarded during the First World War was such that it was ordered that no more than 24 honours were to be carried on the colours, of which no more than 10 were to be honours relating to the First World War.<ref>Army Order 338/1922 paragraph 1(d).</ref>  Similarly, following the Second World War it was ordered that up to 10 honours relating to that conflict could be displayed on the colours, in addition to honours already carried.<ref>Army Council Instruction 58/1956 paragraph 5.</ref> The choice of the honours to be displayed were at the discretion of regimental committees.

The [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] was created on 21 April 1758 from the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=LG31583/> In 1881, under the [[Childers Reforms]], the 64th Regiment of Foot was merged with the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]] (originally raised in 1824) to form the '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment)'''. In 1921 the regimental title was altered to the '''North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)'''.\n\nFormed at a time when the [[British Empire]] was reaching its peak, the regiment served all over the Empire, in times of both peace and war, and in many theatres of war outside the Empire. It fought with distinction in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], as well as in other smaller conflicts around the world. These other wars included the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]], the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]].\n\nIn 1959, as part of a defence review, the North Staffordshire Regiment, by now reduced to only a single regular battalion, was amalgamated with the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]] to form the [[Staffordshire Regiment|Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)]] which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] to form the [[Mercian Regiment]]. Today the traditions of the North Staffordshire Regiment are continued by the [[Mercian Regiment]].\n\n==Formation history==\n{{Main|64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot|98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot}}\n\nThe '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment''' was formed under the [[Childers Reforms]] on 1 July 1881, by the amalgamation of the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] and [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} These two regular regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the new regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} The [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Rifle Volunteers]] forces of North Staffordshire were also incorporated into this new regiment, and a permanent [[Regimental depot|depot]] was established at [[Whittington Barracks]], [[Lichfield]], which also housed the newly formed [[South Staffordshire Regiment]].{{sfn|The brief history of the Staffordshire Regiment, part 1|2010|p=3}}\n\nThe 64th Regiment of Foot was originally raised in 1756 as the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th (Devonshire) Foot]], and was renumbered the 64th in 1758. It had a long history of overseas service with much less time spent in Europe. It had served in the [[West Indies]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], America during the [[American War of Independence]], South America, the West Indies and Canada during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Subsequent long periods were spent in Ireland and the West Indies before action was seen in India during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. At the time of the forming of the amalgamation with the 98th Foot, the 64th was based in Ireland.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe 98th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1824 in [[Chichester]], had a much shorter history, but like the 64th had spent the majority of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the [[First Opium War|First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War]] and India on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]]. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe battalions that constituted the regiment in 1881 were as follows:\n\n* 1st Battalion: the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 2nd Battalion: the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 3rd (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (2nd Staffordshire) Light Infantry Militia, based in [[Stafford]];\n* 4th (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (3rd Staffordshire) Rifles Militia, based in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]];\n* 1st Volunteer Battalion: 2nd Staffordshire ([[Staffordshire Rangers]]) Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]];\n* 2nd Volunteer Battalion: 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in Lichfield but later moved to [[Burton-on-Trent]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}}\n\n==Volunteers and Territorials==\nThe 2nd and 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps were designated the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions, North Staffordshire Regiment, in 1883. Together with the Volunteer battalions of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], they formed the [[Staffordshire Brigade|Staffordshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade]] in 1888. This brigade was intended to assemble at [[Wolverhampton]] in time of war, while in peacetime it acted as a focus for collective training of the Volunteers. On the formation of the [[Territorial Force]] in 1908, the two Volunteer battalions were renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions of the North Staffordshire Regiment, forming part of the Staffordshire Brigade in the [[46th (North Midland) Division|North Midland Division]].{{sfn|Westlake|2010|pages=217\u201322}}{{sfn|Becke|2007|pages=61\u201367}}\n\nThe reserve battalions of the regiment were also reorganised in 1908 by the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]], with the two [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] battalions being re-designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (Special Reserve) battalions, and the volunteer battalions being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions (TF): they were based at [[College Road drill hall, Hanley|College Road]] in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]] and [[Horninglow Street drill hall, Burton upon Trent|Horninglow Street]] in [[Burton upon Trent]] respectively.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=72}}\n\n==Early service (1881\u20131914)==\n\n===Garrison duties and the Mahdist War===\n[[File:North Staffordshire Regiment Officers.jpg|thumb|300px|Officers of the 2nd Battalion, India 1908]]\nThe 1st Battalion was stationed in Ireland at the time of the amalgamation. It moved to England in 1883, and the following year to the [[West Indies]], based mainly in [[Barbados]], but with detachments on other islands. It moved to [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in 1887, to [[Mauritius]] in 1890, to [[Malta]] in 1893 and to [[Egypt]] in 1895. From there the 1st Battalion took part in operations in the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]] under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=67\u201371}} During the campaign, the 1st Battalion were based initially at [[Wadi Halfa]] but moved to [[Gemai]] to avoid a [[cholera]] outbreak. In September the battalion took part in the action against the [[Dervish]] Army at Hafir, which was decisive in ending the campaign. As a result, the North Staffordshire Regiment received the unique \"Hafir\" [[battle honour]], given to no other British regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=71}}{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=64}}\n\n===Second Boer War===\nThe 2nd Battalion was stationed in [[British Raj|India]] in 1881 when the North Staffordshire Regiment was formed, and remained there until 1886. During this time period, it took part in an expedition to the [[Zhob]] Valley in 1884, thus making it the first battalion in the regiment to see active service.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} In 1886, it returned to England via [[Aden]], and then deployed to Ireland in 1893. In 1899, 2nd Battalion mobilised and moved to [[South Africa]], where it took part in the [[Second Boer War]]. Forming part of [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Brigade]] in the [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Division]],{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=73}} the majority of the battalion saw little action throughout the conflict, being mostly occupied in garrison duties in [[Johannesburg]] in 1900.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=75}} In 1901, the battalion was part of a mobile column under [[Brigadier-General Dartnell]] in the Eastern [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] which carried out a [[scorched earth]] campaign.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=75}}\n\nMore action was seen by the [[mounted infantry]] [[Company (military unit)|company]] of the regiment that had been formed on arrival in South Africa. In January 1900 [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], commander of the British forces in South Africa, ordered that every infantry battalion in South Africa was to raise a company of mounted infantry. These companies were to be detached from their parent units and operate as part of eight independent mounted infantry battalions.{{sfn|Badsey|2008|p=97}} The North Staffords company thus formed became part of the 8th Battalion, Mounted Infantry. This unit was involved in the pursuit of [[Koos de la Rey]] and was present when he was captured at [[Wildfontein]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=76}} The militia and volunteer battalions also saw service in the Second Boer War.

On joining the Territorial Force men were asked if they would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service.

The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 in Tamworth Castle Grounds, when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment.

Closed in 1968, the theater was later demolished in 1973.\n\n== History ==\nThe Regal was a major complex that featured films, dance, music, and comedy. The theater was a prominent entertainment venue for over four decades in Chicago, Illinois. This theater opened on February 4, 1928 and was located in the \u201cBronzeville\u201d area of Chicago.<ref name=RTH/> The theater was designed by Levy and Klein and was influenced by the Harlem Savoy Ballroom located in New York City and was owned by a white business association in Chicago. This complex was able to seat about 3,000 people and had several big names come through to perform. The theater was one of the first entertainment complexes that was available for black audiences and also employed black staff members (other than the musical acts). This theater featured silent films, musicians of all types of genres\u2014mainly jazz and blues, and some of the biggest names throughout music history.\n\nWith the ability to see black performers, films, and shows, African Americans were immediately drawn to the theater. Several big names were brought in to perform the popular music of that era. Some of the performers that were brought in included: Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, The Temptations, Miles Davis, Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole, Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson, the Jackson Five, and several others. Typically the shows featured at the Regal consisted of an opening musical act followed by a silent film\u2014which was accompanied with music for dramatic effects. The owner strategically placed the theater in the area because of the Savoy Ballroom and South Center Department store that were both up the street\u2014which was a nightclub and shopping center for blacks, respectively.\n\nThe feel of the theater was elegant and formal. Velvet seating, large pillars, and beautifully decorated\u2014the Regal was definitely a site to see. Costing $1.5 million to construct, the Regal opened new doors for African Americans in the entertainment business. Before the Regal, blacks (in Chicago) were usually not able to find jobs other than the typical low-income jobs, but new employment opportunities were beginning to come about. The Regal eventually had a black manager, hired black entertainment, ushers, dancers (only light-skinned women), and coat checkers which at the time was highly unheard of.\n\nOne of the house bands that got recruited for the Regal was Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra. They had been an opening act at the Savoy Ballroom and had begun to gain a following. Aware of their increased popularity, Balaban and Katz hired Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra to act as a house band for the theater. The Regal Theater and the nearby Savoy Ballroom created an atmosphere for families to go out and have a good time in the city\u2014which was a helpful business factor.\n\nWith the great influx of people coming into the theater, more and more complexes began to open in big cities. The Regal Theater has been often compared to the Apollo Theater in Harlem when considering the best quality of entertainment for an African-American audience. However, the Regal opened six years before the Apollo came into running (which opened in 1934). In addition, the Regal was designed in the first place to be the very best in African American entertainment, unlike the Apollo, and had double the seating capacity. Both theaters were able to attract several big names, but there were a greater amount of big names that performed at the Regal.\n\nPrior to the opening of the Regal, Chicago endured The Great Migration, which brought a large number of blacks from the south into the city looking for a new life and work. After the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, blacks began to slowly move from their southern homes. Once blacks had the ability to move away from their slave owners and find industrial jobs, the north was able to provide this \u201cnew life\u201d for them. Over a 20-30 year period, waves of thousands of blacks left the south and entered major cities like Chicago, New York City, Detroit, and so on.\n\nFor most of its time, the Regal thrived with business by bringing in musical talents from across the country. People had some of the best times at the theater which helped spread the word about it and bring in more business. Eventually, with developments in technology like with the radio and cable TV, business began to decline. With the repercussions of all these factors, the Regal began losing more and more business which eventually led to the owner having to file bankruptcy and close down the theater in 1968. The building was later demolished in 1973. The site is now occupied by the [[Harold Washington Cultural Center]].\n==Notable events==\nIn June 1962, [[Stevie Wonder|\"Little\" Stevie Wonder]] recorded his famous live version of the number-one hit single \"[[Fingertips]]\" at a [[Motortown Revue]] there that included [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Smokey Robinson & The Miracles]], [[Mary Wells]], and [[The Marvelettes]].

Debbie tells him that their affair was a mistake. [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) gives Cameron a job at Emmerdale Haulage and he catches the eye of [[Eve Jenson]] ([[Suzanne Shaw]]). Debbie finally gives into Cameron and they get back together. He also moves into Tug Ghyll with her and her daughter, [[Sarah Sugden Jr|Sarah]] (Sophia Amber Moore), and [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]), Sarah's father, is jealous of Debbie and Cameron's relationship. Cameron also starts a fight with Debbie's father, [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]) and tries to persuade Cain not to interfere in his and Debbie's relationship.\n\nDebbie learns Cameron had another affair after she left Jersey, but he insists it meant nothing and is delighted when Debbie tells him that she is pregnant but miscarries not long afterwards. Cameron tries to support her and not let his feelings show. His sons, [[#Dylan Murray|Dylan]] and [[#Harry Murray|Harry]], come to stay for a few days. Sarah becomes sick and they learn she has a rare genetic disorder. Cameron hires his own truck and starts poaching the King's customers. Carl attacks Cameron's truck and Cameron then plots to ruin the Kings. Cameron, Cain and [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]) steal the Kings' haulage trucks and sell them off. Cameron then wipes all the files containing contracts from Carl's computer. This prompts Cain to tell Cameron he is part of the Dingle clan. Sarah falls ill and Debbie realises that she needs to conceive a saviour sibling with Andy. Cameron is unhappy when he learns they had sex together. Cameron embarks on an affair with Chas Dingle and promises to leave Debbie for her. Carl later discovers the affair and begins blackmailing Cameron and Chas for money. Cameron becomes desperate to raise the amount and he and Chas attempt to rob The Woolpack. Cameron later fights with Carl and hits him over the head with a brick, killing him. Cameron does not admit to killing Carl and Chas is charged with his murder. Consumed with guilt, he confesses the truth to [[Alex Moss]] (Kurtis Stacey). Cameron is then relieved to hear that Chas has been acquitted, but he suspects Alex may go to the police, so he takes Alex hostage in a haulage van. Alex escapes and runs through the woods but Cameron is too quick and catches Alex before dragging him back to the van. As Alex ran, Cameron cannot risk him going to the police so kills him in the van. Cameron is later seen burying Alex in the woods along with his bag of clothes he stole. However, later work begins on the site where Alex is buried so Cameron returns to the gravesite and unearths Alex' decaying corpse and moves it to a different location and burns Alex' bag before returning to the village.\n\nCameron shocks the Dingles' and proposes to Chas and they get engaged. Cameron flies his sons over from Jersey to meet Chas properly but when the boys run and hide at Debbie's, Cameron begins to doubt his choice between Chas and Debbie but when Debbie kidnaps the boys and forces Moira to miscarry, Cameron is shocked when Dylan and Harry refuse to be in the same room with Chas as they believe she killed Carl and Cameron realizes he can never reveal his true secret because of the boys. Cameron and Chas aim to buy the Woolpack but when Cameron's ex-wife Anna refuses to let Cameron see his boys, they are forced to use the money to apply for custody.\n\nCameron begins to feel sorry for Debbie when Andy takes Jack and Sarah away and the pair share a kiss but are almost caught by Chas. Cameron persuades Debbie not to flee and the pair sleep together. He later learns that Debbie almost murdered Chas by holding her a gunpoint whilst he was away in Jersey. Gennie notices a connection between both Cameron and Debbie as they begin to get close again and she tries to get the evidence she needs to prove to Chas that she's right by breaking into Debbie's house to record the pair. However, she gets more than she bargained for as Cameron confesses to the murder of Carl to Debbie. After reconciling their relationship, they both head to the Woolpack to tell Chas that they've reunited but are shocked to see Gennie emerging from the house. They suddenly realise she overheard the confession and chase her. A scared Gennie gets into her car but are quickly pursued by Cameron and Debbie. However, Gennie's car spirals out of control and she's involved in a huge car crash. Panicking, Debbie calls the police while Cameron helps a badly injured Gennie out of wrecked car. Knowing she could expose his secret, Cameron claims his third victim and murders Gennie.\n\nCameron proposes to Debbie and she nearly accepts. but Debbie manages to get Cameron talking about Carl and Gennie's deaths. She tells him that she will forgive him if he tells her what really happened. Cameron then explains how he put his hand over Gennie's mouth and killed her. Debbie screams out a code word and Cameron realises that the police are watching him. He holds Debbie hostage and threatens to kill her. Debbie tries to reason with Cameron, but then she asks if Alex deserved it. Cameron drags Debbie up the stairs, but she pushes him down, injuring him. Debbie escapes and Cameron is arrested.\n\nIn early October 2013, Cameron escapes from prison. Debbie's house is guarded by policemen at all times. Cameron tricks the police in thinking he has escaped to another country by appearing on CCTV at a ferry port, but then moves out the way of the camera and makes his way to Emmerdale. After kidnapping Sarah, he enters The Woolpack with a double barrel shotgun, which he stole from [[Zak Dingle]]'s ([[Steve Halliwell]]) van, which his son [[Sam Dingle|Sam]] ([[James Hooton]]) had parked and holds various villagers at gunpoint. Unbeknownst to him, the gun only has 4 bullets. After threatening to shoot Zak, he accidentally shoots [[Alicia Gallagher|Alicia Harding]] ([[Natalie Anderson]]), one of the hostages. The remaining hostages plead with Cameron to let her go so she can be treated, and he eventually lets her go free with [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]). Finally Cameron lets the rest of the hostages out except for Debbie and Chas, and a dramatic struggle between the three of them causes him to shoot through a window using the last of his bullets. Unaware that all his bullets have gone, he asks Chas and Debbie to decide between them which one should die and counts down from 10. He then had no bullets left but then reloaded the gun. Later on, Marlon woke up and knocked Cameron out and held him at gunpoint as Debbie and Chas tried to escape through the cellar. After the power kept going on and off Cameron and Marlon struggled and Cameron was presumably shot in the process only to appear in the cellar later on. He tried numerous times to drown Debbie, Chas and Marlon. Marlon later escaped and the police then finally broke into the pub as they tried to get rescue Debbie and Chas by cutting into the cellar, Chas was able to escape but Cameron captured Debbie once more. He then attempted to drown her, but she escaped. He tried to grab Debbie's leg once more, but fails and ends up grabbing onto a light bulb - which electrocutes Cameron to death as a result as his reign of terror at Emmerdale is finally over. The following morning, his body is taken away and Debbie makes peace with Chas so that the pair can move on with their lives without Cameron.\n\nThe character is subsequently referenced as time goes on, most specifically when Cameron's voice is later heard by Chas from late November 2015 - after she accidentally stabs Diane.\n\n==Elliot Windsor==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Emmerdale\n|name= Elliot Windsor\n|introducer= Stuart Blackburn\n|portrayer = Oliver Brooke (2011) <br> Jackson Charles Cummins (2012) <br> Luca Hoyle (2016\u2013)\n|years= 2011\u20132012, 2016\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Recurring characters|Present; recurring]]\n|first= 28 March 2011\n|last=\n|father = [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy King]]\n|mother = [[Kelly Windsor]]\n|stepmother = [[Nicola King]]\n|halfbrothers = [[Carl Holliday]]\n|halfsisters = [[Angelica King]]\n|grandfathers = [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] <br> [[Vic Windsor]]\n|uncles = [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]] <br> [[Carl King]] <br> [[Max King (Emmerdale)|Max King]]\n|aunts = [[Donna Windsor]] <br> [[Scarlett Nicholls]]\n|cousins = [[Anya King]] <br> [[Thomas King (Emmerdale)|Thomas King]] <br> [[April Windsor]]\n|relatives = [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Phyllis King|Phyllis King]]\n}}\n\n'''Elliot Windsor''' made his first on screen appearance on 28 March 2011.

However, Rachel is forced to apologize when she learns Amelia was actually the bully. Rachel and Sam then become friends. Rachel's nephew, [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]), finds her and admits stealing money from the garage and [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) collapsed while chasing him. Rachel is angered when Aaron's mother, [[Chas Dingle|Chas]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]), threatens Sean and tells him to stay away from Aaron.\n\nRachel gets a job in [[The Woolpack]] and works with [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and develops feelings for him but he lets her down gently because of his feelings for [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]). Rachel tells Sam she is interested in Brook Cottage but [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) tells Rachel she cannot rent it. Rachel shows her sister, [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), around the cottage and they rent the house. Rachel, Ali, Amelia, Sean and Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), move into Brook Cottage. Rachel starts work as a cleaner at the Sharmas' sweet factory. She sees Jai drinking after a row with his wife and he invites her to join him, which she does and this leads to them having a drunken one night stand. A month or so later, Rachel learns that she's pregnant. Jai is initially shocked but warms to the idea. He stops her having an abortion and offers her a place to live in Leeds. Rachel thinks he is doing it for their child but realizes that he wants her out of the way so his wife won't ask questions. She initially moves in but is lonely and returns to the village. In December 2012, Rachel goes into premature labour and has a son, Archie, supported by Ruby. Jai realizes that he wants to be a proper father and is jealous of Sam spending time with Archie but Rachel is grateful and slaps Jai when he calls Sam stupid. She later realizes she has feelings for Sam, dismaying Lisa Dingle, Ruby and Ali but Samson and Amelia are happy and sends a card to Rachel, pretending to be Sam, leading Rachel to admit her feelings. They get together and Rachel and Archie move in with Sam and Samson and are happy, even after it is revealed that Jai is Archie's father. The Dingles are not pleased and Charity asks Jai to choose: her or Archie. He initially chooses her and suggests that they leave the village and everyone in it behind but Charity refuses to leave Debbie and Sarah. Jai realizes that he cannot live in the same village as his son and not be part of his life. Angered by this, Charity and Noah move in with Debbie and Sarah before filing for divorce. When she catches Declan Macey setting fire to Home Farm and intending to commit suicide, she tries to talk him out of it and he does change his mind. Seeing an opportunity to get rid of Rachel and Archie, she persuades Declan to help her frame Sam, thinking Sam, Rachel, Samson and Archie will go on the run but Rachel insists they stay and Sam clear his name legally so Charity blackmails her to tell the police that she set the fire and then go on the run.\n\nRachel returns as a prosecution witness at [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]]'s ([[Emma Atkins]]) trial for fraud and reconciles with Sam. They move back in together but Rachel now has significant anger management issues and her arguments with Sam turn physical, especially after Jai starts residency proceedings. He is understandably scared of her and Archie leaving again but Rachel is horrified to learn that, in her absence, Jai bought a little boy that he thought was Archie. The child was revealed to be the son of the man who sold him to Jai when Rachel returned with the real Archie. Unfortunately for Jai, his plan to find out what is happening to Archie when he is with Rachel and Sam backfires when Rachel finds the camera and footage of him and his girlfriend, Leyla, discussing their plans for a family life once he has residency and to divorce Megan. Sam and Rachel show the footage to Megan, who plans revenge and quietly starts helping Rachel whenever Jai tries to play tricks on her. Megan does her best including planting drugs in Jai's car, however unknown to Rachel, Megan discovers she is pregnant a few days before the hearing. Unable to forgive Jai for his infidelity, Megan leaves Jai and helps Rachel win Archie back successfully. Rachel, still stressed, keeps losing her temper and hitting Sam. When Ali discovers what Rachel has been doing to Sam, she demands that Rachel go with her to Liverpool and get treatment before she starts hitting Archie too. Rachel agrees and she and Sam part on good terms. Rachel is stunned to hear of Megan's pregnancy and she, Archie and Ali leave the village, heading for a better life. Rachel dies four years later and Dan brings Archie back to the village to live with Jai.\n\n==Amelia Spencer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Amelia Spencer\n|portrayer = Daisy Campbell\n|introducer = Stuart Blackburn\n|years = 2011\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Regular characters|Present; regular]]\n|first = 19 July 2011\n|home = Dale Head\n|occupation = Student\n|father = [[Daz Spencer]]\n|mother = [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]\n|adoptivefather = [[#Dan Spencer|Dan Spencer]]\n|uncles = <!--Even though Dan is now revealed to be her biological uncle, he is more of a father (bar the biology) to her than Daz has been at present in storylines and their father/daughter relationship is far more significant.

Rachel makes Amelia say sorry to Samson when it turns out she was the one doing the bullying and is enrolled in the summer club run by [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) and there, makes friends with the other children. Amelia's family; mother [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), Ali's girlfriend [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]) and her older brother [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]) move into Brook Cottage. Amelia gets fed up of Sean arguing with Ruby and runs away, straight into the path of [[Carl King]]'s ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) van. However, she is pulled out of the way in time by Sam. Amelia is happy when her father, Dan, turns up in the village to see her and Sean.\n\nAmelia decides she wants to believe in God and announces to her mum that she wants to be christened. A few days before her christening day, Amelia changes her mind because two girls at the summer club are bullying her over her mother being a [[lesbian]], which Sean finds amusing. After Ali talks to her, the christening goes ahead as planned. Amelia is a bridesmaid at her father's wedding to [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]). When Chas is later arrested for the murder of Carl, Amelia makes a dummy of her and attempts to throw it on the bonfire. Amelia auditions for the part of Mary in the [[nativity play|nativity]] play at the church. She begs the vicar for the part and on purpose sings louder than the other children. Amelia later meets her baby cousin Archie after Rachel goes into premature labour. Amelia was also a bridesmaid for her father, Dan, and [[Kerry Wyatt]]'s ([[Laura Norton]]) wedding. However, it was later discovered that Kerry was already married but she did not think it was valid since it was in Las Vegas.\n\nIn April 2018, Amelia learns that her mum Ali had died following a car crash in [[Liverpool]], hearing the news from her uncle [[Daz Spencer|Daz]] ([[Mark Jordon]]). Later, Daz drunkenly admits to Kerry that he had a one-night stand with Ali twelve years previously, and Amelia could be his daughter, which was confirmed by a DNA test to be true, whilst Dan and Amelia go to Liverpool to attend Ali's funeral. Amelia later accidentally learns the news that Daz is her biological father and after trying to stop Dan and Daz fighting, she goes missing. Amelia is later found to have been living with Beth, the daughter of a soldier that Daz accidentally shot dead during a firearms handling exercise whilst they were both serving in the [[British Army|army]] in Afghanistan in 2009. Beth wants revenge on Daz, and contacted Amelia via an online chatroom, befriending her, and turning her against her family in person, as well as framing Daz for kidnapping. When [[Bernice Blackstock]] lured Beth to the cricket pavilion and had her arrested on kidnapping, attempted extortion and perverting the course of justice, Amelia protests that Daz should be imprisoned. Amelia is reunited with her family at this point, who assure her that they all love her no matter what.

For Ali, everything is about keeping the family together at the moment.\"<ref name=\"KelliH\"/> Of Ali's relationship with Ruby, Hollis said her character never planned to become a lesbian, but then she met Ruby and fell in love with her. Ali is fully committed to Ruby and did not take the decision to leave her husband lightly.<ref name=\"KelliH\"/>\n\nAli first comes to the village when her sister, Rachel, tells her about a cottage for rent in the village. Ali comes to view it and tells Rachel that she really likes it, so they visit [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]) and ask if she can rent the cottage. Former occupant, [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) overhears and isn't happy when Declan agrees. Ali soon returns to the village with Rachel and her children, Amelia and Sean, to move in but Sean is unhappy when Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), joins them. While Ali and Ruby are moving their stuff, Sean and Ruby argue about how much life would be better without her around and consequently no one notices Amelia disappearing and is nearly run over by [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]). Luckily [[Cameron Murray (Emmerdale)|Cameron Murray]] ([[Dominic Power]]), catches Amelia before she is harmed. Amelia's family run to her and Ali thanks Cameron for saving Amelia and punches Carl for not looking where he is going. However, Ali later learns that Cameron caused the accident, wanting revenge on Carl, so Ali makes them move furniture into Brook Cottage and both men are surprised to discover that Ali and Ruby are lesbians.\n\nAli gets a job at the Sharma and Sharma sweet factory and befriends [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]). When Lisa learns her daughter, [[Belle Dingle|Belle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]), is seeing Sean, she asks Ali to keep him away. Ali struggles to pay the rent and asks Nicola for an extension, which is refused. Ali and Ruby begin drifting apart and things worsen when Ruby suggests moving back to Hotten. Ruby eventually admits having some savings that she planned to use to move away but Ali accuses her of trying to run away but Ruby insists she wants to stay with Ali and her family and asks Ali to divorce Dan but she makes excuses not to. When Sean asks Ali to read his school project, she reveals that she cannot read or write, admitting that she rarely went to school and the teachers didn't help. Ali is asked to cover for Lisa when she has to collect Samson from school because he is ill and accidentally sends a customer the wrong order. Initially, she blames Lisa but when Lisa is suspended, Ali admits to [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) and [[Nikhil Sharma]] ([[Rik Makarem]]) that she [[Literacy#Illiteracy|cannot read]]. They insist she attends an adult literacy course if she wants to keep her job and all goes well until Ali notices another child wearing Sean's trainers and demands he return them. When he refuses, she knocks him over and is removing them herself but is stopped by the staff. The child's parents decline to press charges but the staff ban Ali from the school grounds, so Ruby takes over as Ali's teacher.\n\nIn summer 2012, she discovers that Rachel is pregnant and is unsure what to do next. Ali supports her but is frustrated by Rachel's refusal to name the father of her child and when village gossip accuses David Metcalfe, she attacks him in the Woolpack. Rachel, however, is horrified and demands Ali apologise to him in the Woolpack and accept that Rachel will handle the situation her way or she will leave. Ali accepts it reluctantly and is pleased when Rachel moves into Tenant's Cottage in the village. She, Ruby and the children live quietly for a while until Declan's sister, [[Megan Macey]], takes a shine to the cottage and gives them notice to quit as she plans to live there with her son, [[Robbie Lawson (Emmerdale)|Robbie Lawson]]. When Declan learns of this, he is not pleased and tells Megan to withdraw the notice to quit but she and Zak Dingle go to measure up. Ali visits Declan and tells him what has happened and they return to the cottage, just in time to see Rachel slap Megan. Megan threatens to call the police unless Ali and her family vacate the cottage within 24 hours, which they do and move in with Rachel.\n\nIn April 2015, Dan and Ali drive to Liverpool after discovering that Sean has been involved in a car accident with his friends. When they arrive back home, it is implied that Sean's injuries sustained during the crash are serious and Ali decides to stay in Liverpool until he recovers and Ruby stays in the village to ensure a steady income for the family. In August 2015, Ali returns to the village after Ruby is killed in the helicopter crash at Pete and Debbie's wedding. After Ruby's funeral, Ali discovers Rachel has been physically abusing her partner Sam. Ali asks Rachel to move to Liverpool with her as she can no longer stay in the village because of the memories of Ruby and so that Rachel can get help for her anger issues, both sisters leave Emmerdale on 26 August 2015.\n\nIn April 2018, Ali's former brother-in-law [[Daz Spencer]] received a call from Sean telling him that Ali had been killed in a car accident.

As Alex ran, Cameron cannot risk him going to the police so kills him in the van. Cameron is later seen burying Alex in the woods along with his bag of clothes he stole. However, later work begins on the site where Alex is buried so Cameron returns to the gravesite and unearths Alex' decaying corpse and moves it to a different location and burns Alex' bag before returning to the village.\n\nCameron shocks the Dingles' and proposes to Chas and they get engaged. Cameron flies his sons over from Jersey to meet Chas properly but when the boys run and hide at Debbie's, Cameron begins to doubt his choice between Chas and Debbie but when Debbie kidnaps the boys and forces Moira to miscarry, Cameron is shocked when Dylan and Harry refuse to be in the same room with Chas as they believe she killed Carl and Cameron realizes he can never reveal his true secret because of the boys. Cameron and Chas aim to buy the Woolpack but when Cameron's ex-wife Anna refuses to let Cameron see his boys, they are forced to use the money to apply for custody.\n\nCameron begins to feel sorry for Debbie when Andy takes Jack and Sarah away and the pair share a kiss but are almost caught by Chas. Cameron persuades Debbie not to flee and the pair sleep together. He later learns that Debbie almost murdered Chas by holding her a gunpoint whilst he was away in Jersey. Gennie notices a connection between both Cameron and Debbie as they begin to get close again and she tries to get the evidence she needs to prove to Chas that she's right by breaking into Debbie's house to record the pair. However, she gets more than she bargained for as Cameron confesses to the murder of Carl to Debbie. After reconciling their relationship, they both head to the Woolpack to tell Chas that they've reunited but are shocked to see Gennie emerging from the house. They suddenly realise she overheard the confession and chase her. A scared Gennie gets into her car but are quickly pursued by Cameron and Debbie. However, Gennie's car spirals out of control and she's involved in a huge car crash. Panicking, Debbie calls the police while Cameron helps a badly injured Gennie out of wrecked car. Knowing she could expose his secret, Cameron claims his third victim and murders Gennie.\n\nCameron proposes to Debbie and she nearly accepts. but Debbie manages to get Cameron talking about Carl and Gennie's deaths. She tells him that she will forgive him if he tells her what really happened. Cameron then explains how he put his hand over Gennie's mouth and killed her. Debbie screams out a code word and Cameron realises that the police are watching him. He holds Debbie hostage and threatens to kill her. Debbie tries to reason with Cameron, but then she asks if Alex deserved it. Cameron drags Debbie up the stairs, but she pushes him down, injuring him. Debbie escapes and Cameron is arrested.\n\nIn early October 2013, Cameron escapes from prison. Debbie's house is guarded by policemen at all times. Cameron tricks the police in thinking he has escaped to another country by appearing on CCTV at a ferry port, but then moves out the way of the camera and makes his way to Emmerdale. After kidnapping Sarah, he enters The Woolpack with a double barrel shotgun, which he stole from [[Zak Dingle]]'s ([[Steve Halliwell]]) van, which his son [[Sam Dingle|Sam]] ([[James Hooton]]) had parked and holds various villagers at gunpoint. Unbeknownst to him, the gun only has 4 bullets. After threatening to shoot Zak, he accidentally shoots [[Alicia Gallagher|Alicia Harding]] ([[Natalie Anderson]]), one of the hostages. The remaining hostages plead with Cameron to let her go so she can be treated, and he eventually lets her go free with [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]). Finally Cameron lets the rest of the hostages out except for Debbie and Chas, and a dramatic struggle between the three of them causes him to shoot through a window using the last of his bullets. Unaware that all his bullets have gone, he asks Chas and Debbie to decide between them which one should die and counts down from 10. He then had no bullets left but then reloaded the gun. Later on, Marlon woke up and knocked Cameron out and held him at gunpoint as Debbie and Chas tried to escape through the cellar. After the power kept going on and off Cameron and Marlon struggled and Cameron was presumably shot in the process only to appear in the cellar later on. He tried numerous times to drown Debbie, Chas and Marlon. Marlon later escaped and the police then finally broke into the pub as they tried to get rescue Debbie and Chas by cutting into the cellar, Chas was able to escape but Cameron captured Debbie once more. He then attempted to drown her, but she escaped. He tried to grab Debbie's leg once more, but fails and ends up grabbing onto a light bulb - which electrocutes Cameron to death as a result as his reign of terror at Emmerdale is finally over. The following morning, his body is taken away and Debbie makes peace with Chas so that the pair can move on with their lives without Cameron.\n\nThe character is subsequently referenced as time goes on, most specifically when Cameron's voice is later heard by Chas from late November 2015 - after she accidentally stabs Diane.\n\n==Elliot Windsor==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Emmerdale\n|name= Elliot Windsor\n|introducer= Stuart Blackburn\n|portrayer = Oliver Brooke (2011) <br> Jackson Charles Cummins (2012) <br> Luca Hoyle (2016\u2013)\n|years= 2011\u20132012, 2016\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Recurring characters|Present; recurring]]\n|first= 28 March 2011\n|last=\n|father = [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy King]]\n|mother = [[Kelly Windsor]]\n|stepmother = [[Nicola King]]\n|halfbrothers = [[Carl Holliday]]\n|halfsisters = [[Angelica King]]\n|grandfathers = [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] <br> [[Vic Windsor]]\n|uncles = [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]] <br> [[Carl King]] <br> [[Max King (Emmerdale)|Max King]]\n|aunts = [[Donna Windsor]] <br> [[Scarlett Nicholls]]\n|cousins = [[Anya King]] <br> [[Thomas King (Emmerdale)|Thomas King]] <br> [[April Windsor]]\n|relatives = [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Phyllis King|Phyllis King]]\n}}\n\n'''Elliot Windsor''' made his first on screen appearance on 28 March 2011.

However, Rachel is forced to apologize when she learns Amelia was actually the bully. Rachel and Sam then become friends. Rachel's nephew, [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]), finds her and admits stealing money from the garage and [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) collapsed while chasing him. Rachel is angered when Aaron's mother, [[Chas Dingle|Chas]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]), threatens Sean and tells him to stay away from Aaron.\n\nRachel gets a job in [[The Woolpack]] and works with [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and develops feelings for him but he lets her down gently because of his feelings for [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]). Rachel tells Sam she is interested in Brook Cottage but [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) tells Rachel she cannot rent it. Rachel shows her sister, [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), around the cottage and they rent the house. Rachel, Ali, Amelia, Sean and Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), move into Brook Cottage. Rachel starts work as a cleaner at the Sharmas' sweet factory. She sees Jai drinking after a row with his wife and he invites her to join him, which she does and this leads to them having a drunken one night stand. A month or so later, Rachel learns that she's pregnant. Jai is initially shocked but warms to the idea. He stops her having an abortion and offers her a place to live in Leeds. Rachel thinks he is doing it for their child but realizes that he wants her out of the way so his wife won't ask questions. She initially moves in but is lonely and returns to the village. In December 2012, Rachel goes into premature labour and has a son, Archie, supported by Ruby. Jai realizes that he wants to be a proper father and is jealous of Sam spending time with Archie but Rachel is grateful and slaps Jai when he calls Sam stupid. She later realizes she has feelings for Sam, dismaying Lisa Dingle, Ruby and Ali but Samson and Amelia are happy and sends a card to Rachel, pretending to be Sam, leading Rachel to admit her feelings. They get together and Rachel and Archie move in with Sam and Samson and are happy, even after it is revealed that Jai is Archie's father. The Dingles are not pleased and Charity asks Jai to choose: her or Archie. He initially chooses her and suggests that they leave the village and everyone in it behind but Charity refuses to leave Debbie and Sarah. Jai realizes that he cannot live in the same village as his son and not be part of his life. Angered by this, Charity and Noah move in with Debbie and Sarah before filing for divorce. When she catches Declan Macey setting fire to Home Farm and intending to commit suicide, she tries to talk him out of it and he does change his mind. Seeing an opportunity to get rid of Rachel and Archie, she persuades Declan to help her frame Sam, thinking Sam, Rachel, Samson and Archie will go on the run but Rachel insists they stay and Sam clear his name legally so Charity blackmails her to tell the police that she set the fire and then go on the run.\n\nRachel returns as a prosecution witness at [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]]'s ([[Emma Atkins]]) trial for fraud and reconciles with Sam. They move back in together but Rachel now has significant anger management issues and her arguments with Sam turn physical, especially after Jai starts residency proceedings. He is understandably scared of her and Archie leaving again but Rachel is horrified to learn that, in her absence, Jai bought a little boy that he thought was Archie. The child was revealed to be the son of the man who sold him to Jai when Rachel returned with the real Archie. Unfortunately for Jai, his plan to find out what is happening to Archie when he is with Rachel and Sam backfires when Rachel finds the camera and footage of him and his girlfriend, Leyla, discussing their plans for a family life once he has residency and to divorce Megan. Sam and Rachel show the footage to Megan, who plans revenge and quietly starts helping Rachel whenever Jai tries to play tricks on her. Megan does her best including planting drugs in Jai's car, however unknown to Rachel, Megan discovers she is pregnant a few days before the hearing. Unable to forgive Jai for his infidelity, Megan leaves Jai and helps Rachel win Archie back successfully. Rachel, still stressed, keeps losing her temper and hitting Sam. When Ali discovers what Rachel has been doing to Sam, she demands that Rachel go with her to Liverpool and get treatment before she starts hitting Archie too. Rachel agrees and she and Sam part on good terms. Rachel is stunned to hear of Megan's pregnancy and she, Archie and Ali leave the village, heading for a better life. Rachel dies four years later and Dan brings Archie back to the village to live with Jai.\n\n==Amelia Spencer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Amelia Spencer\n|portrayer = Daisy Campbell\n|introducer = Stuart Blackburn\n|years = 2011\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Regular characters|Present; regular]]\n|first = 19 July 2011\n|home = Dale Head\n|occupation = Student\n|father = [[Daz Spencer]]\n|mother = [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]\n|adoptivefather = [[#Dan Spencer|Dan Spencer]]\n|uncles = <!--Even though Dan is now revealed to be her biological uncle, he is more of a father (bar the biology) to her than Daz has been at present in storylines and their father/daughter relationship is far more significant.

Rachel makes Amelia say sorry to Samson when it turns out she was the one doing the bullying and is enrolled in the summer club run by [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) and there, makes friends with the other children. Amelia's family; mother [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), Ali's girlfriend [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]) and her older brother [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]) move into Brook Cottage. Amelia gets fed up of Sean arguing with Ruby and runs away, straight into the path of [[Carl King]]'s ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) van. However, she is pulled out of the way in time by Sam. Amelia is happy when her father, Dan, turns up in the village to see her and Sean.\n\nAmelia decides she wants to believe in God and announces to her mum that she wants to be christened. A few days before her christening day, Amelia changes her mind because two girls at the summer club are bullying her over her mother being a [[lesbian]], which Sean finds amusing. After Ali talks to her, the christening goes ahead as planned. Amelia is a bridesmaid at her father's wedding to [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]). When Chas is later arrested for the murder of Carl, Amelia makes a dummy of her and attempts to throw it on the bonfire. Amelia auditions for the part of Mary in the [[nativity play|nativity]] play at the church. She begs the vicar for the part and on purpose sings louder than the other children. Amelia later meets her baby cousin Archie after Rachel goes into premature labour. Amelia was also a bridesmaid for her father, Dan, and [[Kerry Wyatt]]'s ([[Laura Norton]]) wedding. However, it was later discovered that Kerry was already married but she did not think it was valid since it was in Las Vegas.\n\nIn April 2018, Amelia learns that her mum Ali had died following a car crash in [[Liverpool]], hearing the news from her uncle [[Daz Spencer|Daz]] ([[Mark Jordon]]). Later, Daz drunkenly admits to Kerry that he had a one-night stand with Ali twelve years previously, and Amelia could be his daughter, which was confirmed by a DNA test to be true, whilst Dan and Amelia go to Liverpool to attend Ali's funeral. Amelia later accidentally learns the news that Daz is her biological father and after trying to stop Dan and Daz fighting, she goes missing. Amelia is later found to have been living with Beth, the daughter of a soldier that Daz accidentally shot dead during a firearms handling exercise whilst they were both serving in the [[British Army|army]] in Afghanistan in 2009. Beth wants revenge on Daz, and contacted Amelia via an online chatroom, befriending her, and turning her against her family in person, as well as framing Daz for kidnapping. When [[Bernice Blackstock]] lured Beth to the cricket pavilion and had her arrested on kidnapping, attempted extortion and perverting the course of justice, Amelia protests that Daz should be imprisoned. Amelia is reunited with her family at this point, who assure her that they all love her no matter what. Amelia still tries to contact Beth, through such means as stealing [[Harriet Finch]]'s mobile. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sean Spencer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Sean Spencer\n|portrayer = [[Luke Roskell]]\n|introducer = Stuart Blackburn (2011)<br/>[[Kate Oates]] (2014)\n|years = 2011\u20132014\n|classification = [[List of past Emmerdale characters#Last appeared in 2014|Former; regular]]\n|first = 10 August 2011\n|last = 5 December 2014\n|home = Liverpool\n|occupation = Student<br />Soldier\n|father = [[#Dan Spencer|Dan Spencer]]\n|mother = [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]\n|stepmother= [[Chas Dingle]] (2012\u20132013)<br />[[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] (2014\u20132015)\n|halfsisters = [[#Amelia Spencer|Amelia Spencer]]\n|aunts = Karen Spencer<br>[[#Rachel Breckle|Rachel Breckle]]\n|uncles = [[Daz Spencer]]\n|cousins = [[Archie Breckle]]\n}}\n'''Sean Spencer''', played by [[Luke Roskell]], made his first on screen appearance on 10 August 2011.<ref name=\"RubyAli\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a332108/emmerdale-announces-new-characters-ali-and-ruby.html|title='Emmerdale' announces new characters Ali and Ruby|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=28 July 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/spoilers/a332368/aaron-has-another-furious-outburst-at-the-pub.html|title=Aaron has another furious outburst at the pub|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref> Roskell's casting was announced in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiepalmeragency.co.uk/news/2011/06/24/emmerdale|title=Emmerdale|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Jackie Palmer Stage School|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> Sean is [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]'s ([[Kelli Hollis]]) son and [[#Amelia Spencer|Amelia]]'s (Daisy Campbell) older brother.<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> Much to his horror, Sean's mother left his father for [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]).<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> Sean is not happy that his mother has come out as a lesbian and she is no longer with his father.<ref name=\"SSpencer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/sean-spencer/|title=Sean Spencer|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> Sean enjoys winding Ruby up.<ref name=\"SSpencer\"/> Sean has been described as a \"tearaway.\"<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> The official ''Emmerdale'' website said Sean is typical teenager, full of attitude and hates being told what to do.

Ali comes to view it and tells Rachel that she really likes it, so they visit [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]) and ask if she can rent the cottage. Former occupant, [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) overhears and isn't happy when Declan agrees. Ali soon returns to the village with Rachel and her children, Amelia and Sean, to move in but Sean is unhappy when Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), joins them. While Ali and Ruby are moving their stuff, Sean and Ruby argue about how much life would be better without her around and consequently no one notices Amelia disappearing and is nearly run over by [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]). Luckily [[Cameron Murray (Emmerdale)|Cameron Murray]] ([[Dominic Power]]), catches Amelia before she is harmed. Amelia's family run to her and Ali thanks Cameron for saving Amelia and punches Carl for not looking where he is going. However, Ali later learns that Cameron caused the accident, wanting revenge on Carl, so Ali makes them move furniture into Brook Cottage and both men are surprised to discover that Ali and Ruby are lesbians.\n\nAli gets a job at the Sharma and Sharma sweet factory and befriends [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]). When Lisa learns her daughter, [[Belle Dingle|Belle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]), is seeing Sean, she asks Ali to keep him away. Ali struggles to pay the rent and asks Nicola for an extension, which is refused. Ali and Ruby begin drifting apart and things worsen when Ruby suggests moving back to Hotten. Ruby eventually admits having some savings that she planned to use to move away but Ali accuses her of trying to run away but Ruby insists she wants to stay with Ali and her family and asks Ali to divorce Dan but she makes excuses not to. When Sean asks Ali to read his school project, she reveals that she cannot read or write, admitting that she rarely went to school and the teachers didn't help. Ali is asked to cover for Lisa when she has to collect Samson from school because he is ill and accidentally sends a customer the wrong order. Initially, she blames Lisa but when Lisa is suspended, Ali admits to [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) and [[Nikhil Sharma]] ([[Rik Makarem]]) that she [[Literacy#Illiteracy|cannot read]]. They insist she attends an adult literacy course if she wants to keep her job and all goes well until Ali notices another child wearing Sean's trainers and demands he return them. When he refuses, she knocks him over and is removing them herself but is stopped by the staff. The child's parents decline to press charges but the staff ban Ali from the school grounds, so Ruby takes over as Ali's teacher.\n\nIn summer 2012, she discovers that Rachel is pregnant and is unsure what to do next. Ali supports her but is frustrated by Rachel's refusal to name the father of her child and when village gossip accuses David Metcalfe, she attacks him in the Woolpack. Rachel, however, is horrified and demands Ali apologise to him in the Woolpack and accept that Rachel will handle the situation her way or she will leave. Ali accepts it reluctantly and is pleased when Rachel moves into Tenant's Cottage in the village. She, Ruby and the children live quietly for a while until Declan's sister, [[Megan Macey]], takes a shine to the cottage and gives them notice to quit as she plans to live there with her son, [[Robbie Lawson (Emmerdale)|Robbie Lawson]]. When Declan learns of this, he is not pleased and tells Megan to withdraw the notice to quit but she and Zak Dingle go to measure up. Ali visits Declan and tells him what has happened and they return to the cottage, just in time to see Rachel slap Megan. Megan threatens to call the police unless Ali and her family vacate the cottage within 24 hours, which they do and move in with Rachel.\n\nIn April 2015, Dan and Ali drive to Liverpool after discovering that Sean has been involved in a car accident with his friends. When they arrive back home, it is implied that Sean's injuries sustained during the crash are serious and Ali decides to stay in Liverpool until he recovers and Ruby stays in the village to ensure a steady income for the family. In August 2015, Ali returns to the village after Ruby is killed in the helicopter crash at Pete and Debbie's wedding.

His paternity is initially in doubt as Kim had been having an affair with [[Dave Glover]] ([[Ian Kelsey]]). Dave dies saving James from a fire before the paternity tests show Frank is the father. Kim expresses doubts about the tests, thinking that Frank's money means he could have paid for the test results to be altered; however, after Frank dies, Dave's father [[Ned Glover]] ([[Johnny Leeze]]) agrees to a second DNA test, which proves James is Frank's son. The following year, Kim marries [[Steve Marchant]] ([[Paul Opacic]]). They are involved in a hit and run accident while stealing a horse, and Kim pins the blame on Steve. She escapes with James in a helicopter to avoid being arrested.\n\nWhen Kim returns to the village without James after she spent six years in prison and sent him to boarding school.
