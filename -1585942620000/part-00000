Created by writers [[Michael Malone]] and [[Ron Carlivati]], the stories depict characters [[Todd Manning|Todd]] (originally [[Roger Howarth]], later [[Trevor St. John]]) and [[Marty Saybrooke|Marty]] ([[Susan Haskell]]) struggling to overcome his actions of rape and destruction. On August 17, 2011, the series revealed St. John's character as Todd's identical twin brother, [[Victor Lord, Jr.]], conditioned to believe he was Todd and to thereby assume Todd's identity, which negated Todd's \"second rape\" of Marty.\n\nThe original rape occurs in 1993, when Todd rapes Marty as part of a revenge scheme.

They had Powell attempt [[suicide]] and soon confess to raping Marty.

In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily.<ref name=\"Malone\"/> Malone felt the most important part of Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her.<ref name=\"Malone\"/> Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.<ref name=\"Malone\"/>\n\nThough Todd's redemption was controversial, it was also largely accepted. In his book '' Behold the Man'', Edisol Dotson suggests acceptance of Todd's redemption as significantly being due to the character's [[physical attractiveness]]. \"Viewers found it in their hearts to forgive Todd his acts of rape and murder. Why? Fans of ''One Life to Live'' consider Todd attractive and sexy,\" stated Dotson. \"Were Todd an ugly man, he would have never been forgiven, and female fans would not crowd the studio's backdoor shouting his name.\"<ref name=books.gOogle.com/> The \"good-looking rapist\" theory largely contributing to the character's success has been argued by some female fans, however.<ref name=books.google.com/>\n\nIn 1995, Howarth left the role for the first time. Significantly brought on by Todd's redemption storyline, he said he had no desire to portray a redeemed Todd. In the October 24, 1995 ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' issue, he stated:<blockquote>In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it was the result of a real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos that he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna.  [Then-Executive Producer] [[Linda Gottlieb]] told me with reasonable certainty that [''One Life to Live''] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me that they were taking the character on a different path &mdash; they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play [[Lord family|Todd Lord]]. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic &mdash; it's a [[fairy tale]]. I thought, \"It would be best for the show if I were to leave.\" That's when I tendered my resignation.<ref name=soapoperAdigesT.com/></blockquote>\n\nHowarth went on to say Todd and Marty suddenly bonding did not make sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. \"If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania#Restaurants and eateries|Rodi's]] &mdash; to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd &mdash; is bizarre,\" he said.<ref name=soapoperAdigesT.com/> \"People have come up to me and said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.'

They had Powell attempt [[suicide]] and soon confess to raping Marty. He is publicly forgiven by Marty herself, which enrages Todd when he and fellow rapist Zach receive eight-year sentences behind prison compared to Powell's three months of jail time. Todd makes a vow that he will be out of prison in three months as well.<ref name=books.google.com/> To carry out this vow, Todd was written to escape by \"drugging himself, waking from a coma to leap from a speeding ambulance, and then reviving himself again by stabbing a knife through his hand while rolling his eyes heavenward\" and saying the pain felt good.<ref name=books.google.com/> The scary determination of the character had become characteristic of him by then, and he often seemed [[superhuman]].<ref name=books.google.com/> Within the story, he wants revenge on the person he feels is most responsible for his prison time, Nora. With his escape from prison, he sets out to attack the currently blind Nora. Todd stalks and torments her, but she is spared from his attack by her then-husband [[Bo Buchanan]] ([[Robert S.

In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily.<ref name=\"Malone\"/> Malone felt the most important part of Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her.<ref name=\"Malone\"/> Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.<ref name=\"Malone\"/>\n\nThough Todd's redemption was controversial, it was also largely accepted. In his book '' Behold the Man'', Edisol Dotson suggests acceptance of Todd's redemption as significantly being due to the character's [[physical attractiveness]]. \"Viewers found it in their hearts to forgive Todd his acts of rape and murder. Why? Fans of ''One Life to Live'' consider Todd attractive and sexy,\" stated Dotson. \"Were Todd an ugly man, he would have never been forgiven, and female fans would not crowd the studio's backdoor shouting his name.\"<ref name=books.gOogle.com/> The \"good-looking rapist\" theory largely contributing to the character's success has been argued by some female fans, however.<ref name=books.google.com/>\n\nIn 1995, Howarth left the role for the first time. Significantly brought on by Todd's redemption storyline, he said he had no desire to portray a redeemed Todd. In the October 24, 1995 ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' issue, he stated:<blockquote>In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it was the result of a real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos that he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna.  [Then-Executive Producer] [[Linda Gottlieb]] told me with reasonable certainty that [''One Life to Live''] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me that they were taking the character on a different path &mdash; they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play [[Lord family|Todd Lord]]. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic &mdash; it's a [[fairy tale]]. I thought, \"It would be best for the show if I were to leave.\" That's when I tendered my resignation.<ref name=soapoperAdigesT.com/></blockquote>\n\nHowarth went on to say Todd and Marty suddenly bonding did not make sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. \"If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania#Restaurants and eateries|Rodi's]] &mdash; to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd &mdash; is bizarre,\" he said.<ref name=soapoperAdigesT.com/> \"People have come up to me and said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.'

There would have been no question at that time that Todd had indeed changed.\"<ref name=www.jackmyers.com/>\n\nIn December 2008, Todd is officially charged with several crimes, including rape. The rape charges, as well as others, are eventually dropped when character [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] is allowed to question Marty at the [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] and subsequently \"proves\" the sex to have been consensual, regardless of Marty's mental state.<ref name=\"On air\"/> However, on February 5, 2009, the series showcases Todd's admittance that the sex was indeed rape; the confession is made to Marty and others as Todd concurs Marty would have never been sexually intimate with him if not for her mental disability and his manipulation of her, and that he now genuinely considers the act to have been rape.<ref>Todd admits that it was rape, ''[[One Life to Live]]'' (2009-02-05). Retrieved on 2009-02-05.</ref>\n\nThough the romance received criticism, others spoke positively about the storyline, including one of the show's cast members. [[Kristen Alderson]], who portrays [[Starr Manning]], Todd's daughter on the series, remarked, \"I loved the couple switch, how Marty was with Todd, and Blair was with John.\" She said, \"I thought that they were all sweet couples, and I think they actually went well together \u2014 even though Todd and Marty\u2019s was more twisted! But it was interesting, and it was a breath of fresh air for all the characters.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=''ABC Soaps in Depth'' Interviews: A 2008 Reflection (Kristen Alderson)|magazine=[[Soaps In Depth]]|date=2009-01-07}}</ref>\n\nSt. John said that he decided not to make the determination of whether Todd was in love with Marty or not. \"I decided to leave it to the audience. Maybe Todd loves her in certain moments. Maybe in other moments, Todd just says he does. I played it like a high school crush,\" he said. \"I thought it would be more fascinating if Todd was walking around as a contradiction in terms of his feelings for Marty. Sometimes it was put-on, and other times, it was Todd thinking.\"<ref name=TvGuiDe.com/> He said that the relationship was always \"fluctuating and evolving\".<ref name=TvGuiDe.com/>\n\nBranco, who had severely criticized the storyline, stated that the payoff was worth the tense moments. \"However obscene or depraved the riskiest storyline in recent memory was,\" he said, \"the fallout has been shockingly riveting \u2014 thanks to the fact that head writer Ron Carlivati is playing all the psychological beats of Todd\u2019s self-serving and criminal actions.\"<ref name=TvGuiDe.com/> In addition, Branco gave credit to St. John. \"Nominated for a 2009 Soap Opera Spirit Award as outstanding lead actor, St. John inarguably faced the most challenging assignment of any actor in 2008 \u2014 in any genre,\" said Branco.<ref name=TvGuiDe.com/> \"And yet, somehow, St. John made it work. In a lesser actor\u2019s hands, the storyline most certainly would have resulted in career suicide for all involved.\"<ref name=TvGuiDe.com/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Todd Manning and Blair Cramer]]\n*[[T\u00e9a Delgado#Todd and T.C3.A9a|Todd Manning and T\u00e9a Delgado]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author = Martha Fineman, Martha T.

The battle was fought as part of the allied counterattack to rid the German held ground of the 'Bulge' which forced them on the defensive. [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] with [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]] attached was tasked with clearing the area East of [[Dinant]], [[Rochefort, Belgium|Rochefort]], [[Grupont]] and [[Bure, Belgium|Bure]]. In a tough battle Bure was secured after nearly three days of heavy fighting whilst Gupont and Rochefort were both cleared with little resistance and the advance continued.\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1944, the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German armies]] launched a massive counter-attack through the forests of the Ardennes. The plan was to drive across the [[River Meuse]] and on to [[Antwerp]] to split the Allied armies and their lines of communication. As part of the [[First Allied Airborne Army]], 6th Airborne Division was available as a component of the strategic reserve for the Allied forces in northwest Europe. The other two divisions available in reserve, the American [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne]], were already at [[Rheims]] in northern [[France]]. A the same time the 6th Airborne rested and re-trained after [[Operation Tonga|their success]] in [[Normandy landings|Normandy]] was sent from England by sea to Belgium to assist in the defence.<ref>Hastings, p.239</ref>\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] the 6th Airborne Division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance.

Once these had been captured, a crossing over the [[Lomme (river)|River Lomme]] would be seized in order to halt any German breakthrough and thus put them firmly on the defensive.<ref name=bure>{{cite web|accessdate=19 May 2011|publisher=Para Data|title=Battle of Bure|url=http://www.paradata.org.uk/content/battle-bure}}</ref>\n\nThe following day the [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion]] of the 5th Parachute Brigade left Resteigne on foot and at 13:00 started the attack on Bure. Supported by the tanks, 'A' Company was to secure the village, while 'B' Company secured the high ground and 'C' Company was in reserve. The attack was met immediately with sustained heavy mortar and machine gun fire, supported by German armour and casualties began to rise in both companies. After being repelled they regrouped and attacked again and this time 'A' Company managed to gain a foothold in the village while 'B' Company reached the high ground by which it was able to enter Bure. At 17:00 'C' Company was sent in to reinforce 'A' and 'B' Companies, who were holding half the village with difficulty but this time they were supported by combined tank and artillery fire.<ref name=Whiting178>Whiting, p.178</ref>\n\nGerman counterattacks now began but the battalion was able to form a tight perimeter around half the village and develop strong points in all occupied buildings. As a result, they carried out fighting patrols and fought off four German counterattacks with one on 'A' Company which was only defeated when they called down artillery fire on their own positions. In the closeness of the fighting, the paratroopers used their [[Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife|fighting knives]] to avoid giving away their locations and casualties could not be evacuated nor could supplies be brought forward.<ref name=bure/><ref name=Whiting178 />\n\nOn 4 January the battalion was subjected to a continuous artillery barrage, and fought off another five German counterattacks knocking out tanks with their [[PIAT]]S. At one stage in the battle an ambulance did get in to Bure from which stepped a [[Sergeant]] of the [[225th (Parachute) Field Ambulance]] from the [[Regimental Aid Post]] accompanied by a [[Military Chaplain|padre]]. It stopped a few yards from a German [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]] which had moved up to it, almost pointing its gun through the drivers window, a German officer appeared who agreed in perfect English that the wounded could be collected but the ambulance was not to return.<ref name=Whiting178 />\n\nBy now the town of Bure was nearly a heap of rubble but the Germans clung to the houses and ruins, hid in cellars and catacombs, fighting and sniping to the end. Tiger tanks were still operating in the village which made mopping up extremely difficult. In the evening 'C' Company from 2nd Battalion, [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]] from 6th Airlanding Brigade joined the 13th Parachute Battalion as reinforcements, and in the early hours of 5 January, a determined attack by the Battalion succeeded in pushing the bulk of the Germans out of the village although one Tiger tank remained despite repeated PIAT attacks on it.<ref>Saunders, pp.279\u2013280</ref> However, by 21:00 the last German outpost was eliminated by' 'A Company and the village was secured and German resistance ceased. During the same time the [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion]] had captured Grupont with only light resistance and with 5th Parachute Brigades objectives now taken the battle came to an end.<ref name=Whiting181>Whiting, p.181</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:13th (Lancashire) Battalion memorial Bure (Belgium).jpg|thumb|205px|Memorial at Bure, Belgium]]\nIn the fight to capture Bure and the surrounding villages, the units sustained heavy casualties. The [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion]] lost about a third its strength: seven officers and 182 enlisted (68 killed in action). The 2nd Battalion, Ox and Bucks, lost one officer and 20 enlisted (seven KIA).

At [[Bande, Belgium|Bande]] on 11 January 1945, a patrol from the [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion]] who had been in reserve, accompanied by the Belgian SAS, discovered the bodies of thirty four civilians who had been murdered by the Germans on Christmas Eve.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schrijvers |first=Peter|title=The Unknown Dead: Civilians in the Battle of the Bulge|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813137582|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6HuLY9HObA4C&pg=PT298&dq=Bande+11th+January+massacre&hl=en&sa=X&ei=x1X-UczZMqen0AXr94GgCA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Bande%2011th%20January%20massacre&f=false}}</ref><ref name=Toland355>Toland, p.355</ref>\n\nBy the middle of 6 January the 6th Airborne Division withdrew to Holland and patrolled along the [[River Maas]] before returning to the United Kingdom in late February in preparation for their next undertaking in [[Operation Varsity]].<ref name=\"harc549\"/> When [[General (United States)|General]] [[Courtney Hodges]] commanding the [[First United States Army|First US Army]] joined up with General [[George S.

After the rape, the Moor manipulates Titus into cutting off his right hand to redeem his sons, but his sons are killed regardless, and their hearts are sent to Titus as a taunt. In an attempt to revenge himself, Titus kills the Queen's sons and, with Lavinia's help, bakes them into a pie to feed to the Queen. In the ballads penultimate stanza, after feeding the pies of her sons' flesh to the Queen, Titus kills Lavinia, the Queen, the Emperor, and eventually himself. The final stanza, still spoken by Titus, documents the Moor's punishment, calling it a just end for all murderers: the Moor was buried into the ground, standing, so that he might starve to death.\n\n==Surviving Copies==\nA number of printed copies of the ballad survive in various special collections: In the British Library, the Roxburghe collection, which houses about 1,500 ballads, possesses a copy of the ballad, estimated to be ca. 1683\u20131693; the Huntington Library, a much smaller but still significant collection of ballads, has a copy estimated to have been printed somewhere between 1725 and 1769; and the [[Pepys]] collection at Magdalene College houses two copies of the ballad, ca. 1684-1686 and 1624.\n\n==Form==\n\n===Language===\nOn three of the four surviving ballads, the full title is quite long: \"The Lamentable and Tragical History of Titus Andronicus; with the Fall of his 25 sons, in the Wars with the Goths, with the manner of the Ravishment of his Daughter Lavinia, by the Empresses two Sons, through the means of a bloody Moor, taken by the sword of Titus, in the War: with his Revenge upon their cruel and inhumane Act.\" The fourth ballad, from the Pepys collection ca. 1624, is titled only \"Titus Andronicus Complaint.\"\n\nThe ballad is mostly composed in [[iambic pentameter]], rather than the traditional [[ballad meter]].

Next to Titus's revenge act, the woodcut shows the Moor to the side as having been half-buried, standing up in the ground. 2. In the background, the woodcut illustrates Lavinia writing the names of her rapists/mutilators in the dirt with a stick balanced between the stumps of her arms. 3.
