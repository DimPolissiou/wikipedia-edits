Grace refuses Stubbs' offer to help her escape, believing the hosts are not harming the guests and desiring to explore the park further. The prisoners are taken to Akecheta, a Ghost Nation elder who prepares to sacrifice them. Grace panics and runs away, but Stubbs discovers that the sacrifice was a ruse to identify the hosts from humans.\n\nClementine abandons Bernard outside a cave in an isolated corner of the park. Inside he finds Elsie, whom he abducted and left in the cave when operating under Ford's instruction. Elsie is hostile toward him until he explains that he had been under Ford's control, and Ford is now dead. Bernard discovers the cave hides the entrance to a hidden bunker where they find the dead bodies of technicians and drone hosts. Elsie stabilizes Bernard with another injection of cortical fluid and warns him that his memories are blending together. Exploring the bunker further, they discover a locked room and an insane host resembling James Delos. A series of flashbacks reveal that William and James tried to implant James' consciousness in a host body to create a human-host hybrid and achieve immortality. However, in over one hundred attempts, each host reached a \"cognitive plateau,\" where they became unstable, and William terminated the program as he believed that man was meant to be mortal, and the world was better off without James. Elsie destroys James' hybrid and agrees to help Bernard further on the condition that Bernard does not lie to her. Bernard accepts, but in a subsequent memory, he realizes that he ordered the drone hosts to kill the technicians and destroy themselves after retrieving a second human-host control unit.\n\nIn the park, William and Lawrence return to Lawrence's home town. They find Major Craddock and the Confederados have overrun it. Craddock demands to know the location of a hidden cache of weapons and proceeds to torment and kill the townspeople. William deduces that Ford's new narrative sees himself and various factions within Westworld heading west to the \"Valley Beyond,\" or as Craddock knows it, \"Glory.\" He reveals the location of the cache and offers to lead Craddock to Glory; Craddock accepts, only to continue tormenting the townspeople by forcing them to play games with nitroglycerin for his amusement. William overpowers Craddock and kills his men, then force-feeds Craddock the nitroglycerin. Lawrence shoots him, causing Craddock to explode. Speaking through Lawrence's daughter, Ford reminds William that one good deed does not redeem him. William dismisses Ford, telling him that he was never looking for redemption. William, Lawrence, and a group of men from the town head west until they encounter Grace, who greets William as \"dad\", thus revealing her identity as Emily Grace, William's daughter.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Lisa_Joy_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was Lisa Joy's directorial debut.]]\n\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was the directorial debut of co-showrunner [[Lisa Joy]].

On 14 February 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] to [[Berchtesgaden]], and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 1 March, Bulgaria joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}}\n\nFurther pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} On 6 March, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=13}} On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|complied]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]] officers, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Borivoje Mirkovi\u0107]], [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|deposed]] Prince Paul.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=43\u201344}} He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], who was scheduled to ascend to the throne on his birthday.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe day of the coup, Hitler issued [[Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]], which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the [[Balkans]]. He ordered that \"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler decided that [[Belgrade]] would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (''Unternehmen Strafgericht''). On 27 and 28 March 1941, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' IV]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (General) [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L\u00f6hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}} Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, but at the last minute L\u00f6hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}}\n\nOn 3 April, [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] flew a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to [[Graz]] and defected to the Germans. He disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} On the afternoon of 5 April, a British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] visited Mirkovi\u0107 at the VVKJ base in [[Zemun]] and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the next day.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an [[open city]] in the event of hostilities. The German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], but in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \"Fortress Belgrade\" after the first bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}}\n\nBy 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern [[medium bomber]]s. Other than a small number of locally made [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}} The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E-3a fighters, 15 [[Hawker Hurricane]] MkIs, and six Rogo\u017earski IK-3s.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n== Bombing ==\n{{also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016226-0005A, Belgrad, Altes Schloss, Sch\u00e4den.jpg|thumb|right|The bomb-damaged [[Stari dvor|Old Palace]] in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941|alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background]]\nGerman ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, [[Joseph Goebbels]], announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}} The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with [[Easter]] Sunday as observed by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which uses the [[Julian calendar]].{{sfn|Zaki\u0107|2017|p=64}} Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based ''Fliegerf\u00fchrer'' Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=196}}\n\nThe first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers, and 160 [[Heinkel He 111]] medium bombers and [[Dornier Do 17]] [[light bomber]]s at {{convert|8000|-|10000|ft|m}}.

Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at [[Kni\u0107]] arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one ''Stuka'' shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013198}} On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the [[General Post Office, Belgrade|post office]] including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Supreme Command]] building, the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|military academy]], the [[Royal Compound, Belgrade|royal palace at Dedinje]], the royal guard barracks at [[Top\u010dider]], the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}}\n\nImmediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters.

A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at [[Kragujevac]], acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n[[File:Bombed National Library Belgrad.JPG|thumb|left|A 2008 photograph of the ruins of the National Library of Serbia, bombed on 6 April 1941|alt=an overgrown crater with ruined walls around part of the perimeter]]\nBelgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion.

Punishment).{{sfn|Chant|1986|p=17}} [[Martin Gilbert]], a historian specialising in the [[Holocaust]], writes that the operation was codenamed ''[[wikt:castigo|Castigo]]'' (\"punishment\").{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=170}} The historian Vladimir Terzi\u0107 offers the [[Serbo-Croatian]] translation, ''Kazna'' (\"punishment\").{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}|group=lower-alpha}} was the April 1941 German [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] of [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], in retaliation for the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] that overthrew the government that had signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] (VVKJ) had only 77 modern [[fighter aircraft]] available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and [[bomber]]s that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets and divulging the VVKJ's codes.\n\nThree more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The ground invasion had begun a few hours earlier, and air attacks were also made on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the [[National Library of Serbia]], which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the [[Belgrade Zoo]].\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] carried out two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the attacks on Yugoslavia, which surrendered on 17 April. The senior [[Luftwaffe]] officer responsible for the bombing, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, convicted on all counts, and executed in 1948. A monument erected in [[New Belgrade]] in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defence. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|Tripartite Pact}}\nFollowing Germany's 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] political pressure as its neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with Italy when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]]. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]], and Romania also joined the Pact.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their [[client state]]s, and its neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] to [[Berchtesgaden]], and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 1 March, Bulgaria joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}}\n\nFurther pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} On 6 March, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=13}} On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|complied]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]] officers, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Borivoje Mirkovi\u0107]], [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|deposed]] Prince Paul.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=43\u201344}} He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], who was scheduled to ascend to the throne on his birthday.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe day of the coup, Hitler issued [[Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]], which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the [[Balkans]]. He ordered that \"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler decided that [[Belgrade]] would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (''Unternehmen Strafgericht''). On 27 and 28 March 1941, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' IV]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (General) [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L\u00f6hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}} Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, but at the last minute L\u00f6hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}}\n\nOn 3 April, [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] flew a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to [[Graz]] and defected to the Germans. He disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} On the afternoon of 5 April, a British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] visited Mirkovi\u0107 at the VVKJ base in [[Zemun]] and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the next day.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an [[open city]] in the event of hostilities. The German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], but in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \"Fortress Belgrade\" after the first bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}}\n\nBy 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern [[medium bomber]]s. Other than a small number of locally made [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}} The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E-3a fighters, 15 [[Hawker Hurricane]] MkIs, and six Rogo\u017earski IK-3s.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n== Bombing ==\n{{also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016226-0005A, Belgrad, Altes Schloss, Sch\u00e4den.jpg|thumb|right|The bomb-damaged [[Stari dvor|Old Palace]] in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941|alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background]]\nGerman ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, [[Joseph Goebbels]], announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}} The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with [[Easter]] Sunday as observed by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which uses the [[Julian calendar]].{{sfn|Zaki\u0107|2017|p=64}} Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based ''Fliegerf\u00fchrer'' Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=196}}\n\nThe first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers, and 160 [[Heinkel He 111]] medium bombers and [[Dornier Do 17]] [[light bomber]]s at {{convert|8000|-|10000|ft|m}}. They were escorted by [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] [[heavy fighter]]s at {{convert|11000|-|12000|ft|m}} and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=195}} The entire Yugoslav 6th Fighter Brigade, consisting of the 51st Fighter Group at Zemun and the 32nd Fighter Group at [[Prnjavor (Belgrade)#Boroughs|Prnjavor]], totalling 29 Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and five Rogo\u017earski IK-3s, were scrambled to intercept the Germans.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013197}} The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG 77). Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at [[Kni\u0107]] arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one ''Stuka'' shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013198}} On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the [[General Post Office, Belgrade|post office]] including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Supreme Command]] building, the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|military academy]], the [[Royal Compound, Belgrade|royal palace at Dedinje]], the royal guard barracks at [[Top\u010dider]], the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}}\n\nImmediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters. They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at [[Kragujevac]], acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n[[File:Bombed National Library Belgrad.JPG|thumb|left|A 2008 photograph of the ruins of the National Library of Serbia, bombed on 6 April 1941|alt=an overgrown crater with ruined walls around part of the perimeter]]\nBelgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, consisting of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near [[Vienna]], escorted by 60 fighters. This wave was met by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, which claimed four German aircraft. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n\nThe Germans claimed nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April. Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged. The Yugoslavs claimed to have shot down twenty-two German aircraft and forced two others to land. The Germans lost twelve aircraft, significantly fewer than claimed by the Yugoslavs: two Do 17Z light bombers, five Bf 110 heavy fighters, four Ju 87 dive bombers, and one Bf 109E fighter.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' [[Gerhard Koall]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} He went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in 1944.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=216}}\n\nGerman bombers and dive-bombers dropped {{convert|215|-|360|LT|ST}} of [[aerial bomb|bombs]] and [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]] on the capital.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}}{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=194}} The weak VVKJ and inadequate anti-aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault, but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack. Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders. A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft, downed 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on the ground.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}} The military historian Daniel L. Zajac writes that the Germans lost 40 aircraft during the two-day air battle.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} Another source indicates the loss of 14 German aircraft on 6 April.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=200\u2013208}} Dive-bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}}\n\nAccording to the historian [[Stevan K. Pavlowitch]], the bombing of Belgrade lasted three days.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the [[National Library of Serbia]], which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of rare books, maps, and [[medieval]] manuscripts were destroyed.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=41}} Also struck was the [[Belgrade Zoo]], sending frightened animals running through the streets.{{sfn|Freeman|2008|p=94}}\n\n== British retaliation ==\n[[No. 37 Squadron RAF|No. 37 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) conducted [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|two bombing raids]] on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. Operating [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from an airfield in Greece, the squadron conducted raids on 6/7 April and 12/13 April, dropping a total of {{convert|30|LT|ST}} of high-explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941. The historian Herman Knell calls the retaliatory justification for these raids \"strange and implausible\".{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=195}} The aviation historians Shores, Cull and Malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on the lines of communication of German forces attacking Greece and Yugoslavia, and note that the raid on 6/7 April targeted an ammunition train and other installations in Sofia, and the raid on 12/13 April bombed the railway marshalling yards. Other similar targets in Bulgaria were attacked by the RAF during the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=232, 243}}\n\n== Aftermath and legacy ==\n[[File:Spomenik pilotima 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument to the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution, located in [[New Belgrade]]|alt=rectangular polished dark stone plinth pointing toward the sky, with a winged plaque and inscription at the base]]\nThe bombing of Belgrade paralysed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters, and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Civilian casualties were significant, but sources vary widely from 1,500 to 17,000 killed.{{sfn|Knell|2009|pp=194\u2013195}} They were worsened by the disclosure of air-raid shelter locations to the Germans in the days preceding the attack.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} The official casualty figure released by the occupation authorities soon after the bombing was 2,271 killed. Other sources mention 5,000 to 10,000 fatalities, and later Yugoslav estimates ranged even higher.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=16}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=18}} The historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following \"careful postwar investigations\", and indicates that a figure between 3,000 and 4,000 is more realistic.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=74}}\n\nBelgrade was occupied on 13 April 1941, and four days later, Yugoslavia capitulated.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=19}} Afterwards, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that {{convert|218.5|MT}} of bombs were dropped, 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped, and that areas in the centre and north-west of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of the aerial mines.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Significant damage was done to Belgrade, particularly to the water and electrical systems.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=17\u201318}} After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 [[Jews]] to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}} Unexploded German bombs continue to be unearthed in the 21st century.{{sfn|Nikolic 28 July 2015}}\n\nL\u00f6hr was captured by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] on 9 May 1945, escaped, and was recaptured on 13 May. He was intensively interrogated, after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on war crimes charges, one of which related to his command of ''Luftflotte'' IV during Operation Retribution. L\u00f6hr was convicted by the Yugoslav military court and sentenced to death.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=756\u2013757}} He was executed on 26 February 1947.{{sfn|Barbier|2017|p=155}} Following the invasion, Kren was appointed head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske}}, ZNDH). He was arrested in Italy in March 1947 and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried on unrelated charges of war crimes for his role in the targeting of civilians by the ZNDH. He was found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948.{{sfn|Go\u00f1i|2002|p=236}}\n\nThe bombing of Belgrade was depicted in the 1980 Yugoslav feature film ''[[Who's Singin' Over There?]]'' ({{lang-sh|Ko to tamo peva|link=no}}) and the 1995 feature film ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' ({{lang-sh|Podzemlje|link=no}}).{{sfn|Goulding|2002|pp=167\u2013168, 186}} It is also the subject of [[Miodrag Pavlovi\u0107]]'s poem ''Belgrade 1941'' ({{lang-sh|Beograd 1941|link=no}}).{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=124}} The [[Serbian American]] poet [[Charles Simic]], a survivor of the bombing, wrote a poem titled \"Cameo Appearance\" recounting his experiences.{{sfn|Forhan|2008|pp=255\u2013256}} A monument commemorating the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution was inaugurated in [[New Belgrade]] on 6 April 1997. It was designed by the sculptor [[Miodrag \u017divkovi\u0107 (sculptor)|Miodrag \u017divkovi\u0107]].{{sfn|Glas javnosti 29 July 2005}} On 6 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of the bombing, a memorial service was held for the victims, attended by the Serbian [[Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy (Serbia)|Minister for Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy]], [[Aleksandar Vulin]].{{sfn|B92 6 April 2016}} In June 2017, it was announced that the site containing the ruined foundations of the National Library of Serbia would be made into a memorial

Pundit [[Paul Kedrosky]] called it an \"incredible cop-out\", and he also speculated that the selection marked \"some sort of near-term market top for user-generated content\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Paul Kedrosky | title=I Call \"Market Top\" on \"You\" | url=http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/12/16/i_call_market_t.html | work=Infectious Greed | date=16 December 2006 | accessdate=2008-02-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207013442/http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/12/16/i_call_market_t.html | archive-date=7 February 2008 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Commentator Kevin Friedl noted that the award and cover design recalled the mirror viewed by the protagonist, the Dude, of ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', via which the viewer's reflection was framed as ''Time''{{'s}} \"Man of the Year\".<ref name=\"friedl\">\n[http://newassignment.net/blog/kevin_friedl/dec2006/17/times_person_of_ Time's Person of the Year - An Initial Response] by Kevin Friedl on December 18, 2006\n</ref>\n\nIn December 2012, journalist David A. Graham wrote for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that he thought ''Time'' had shown \"a pattern of lackluster choices\" and the overall promotional nature of the process shouldn't be treated as news, rather simply viewed as [[marketing]]. He remarked, \"Is anyone out there {{em|not}} sick of people ironically listing 'Time Person of the Year, 2006' in Twitter bios, a reference to the gimmicky selection of 'You' that year?\"<ref name=graham>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/everyone-should-ignore-times-person-of-the-year/266462/ |title=Everyone Should Ignore Time's Person of the Year |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the decision raised some criticism as it was described as ideological and even hypocritically political. Some weeks before the announcement, ''Time'' decided to ask the users in a poll, \"Who Should Be Person of the Year?\"  After several weeks, the poll winner by a wide margin was [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], the president of [[Venezuela]], with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], came in second. ''Time'' did not mention these results in the announcement of their \"Person of the Year\" and its critics claimed that ''Time'' discounted input from its [[digital democracy]] among its readers. ''Time'' supporters argue that an online poll is not representative as it has no scientific value.

Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the \"study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures.\"\n\nThe launch in January 1983 of the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology.\n\nEarlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based [[observatory|observatories]]. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared [[wavelength]]s or [[frequency|frequencies]], both the Earth's [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as [[IRAS]], the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and [[Infrared Space Observatory|ISO]], the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.\n\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal\n |image1  = Ksc arrive04.jpg\n |width1  = 120\n |caption1= The SIRTF in a Kennedy Space Center clean room.\n |image2  = 300th Delta launches with Spitzer.jpg\n |width2  = 154\n |caption2= The launch of SIRTF in 2003 aboard the 300th Delta rocket.\n}}\n\nMost of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments. It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard [[STS-51-F]] showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively \"dirty\" vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983, NASA was considering the \"possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/infrared/index.html |title=Studying the Universe in Infrared |accessdate=8 December 2007 |last=Watanabe |first=Susan |date=22 November 2007 |publisher=NASA}}</ref>\u00b7<ref>{{cite web |last=Kwok |first=Johnny |title=Finding a Way: The Spitzer Space Telescope Story |work=Academy Sharing Knowledge |publisher=NASA |url=http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php |date=Fall 2006 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908000438/http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=8 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n''Spitzer'' is the only one of the [[Great Observatories]] not launched by the [[Space Shuttle]], as was originally intended. However, after the 1986 [[STS-51-L|Challenger disaster]], the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] [[LH2]]\u2013[[LOX]] upper stage, which would have been required to place it in its final orbit, was banned from Shuttle use. The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission that could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle.\n[[File:Animation of Spitzer Space Telescope trajectory around Earth.gif|thumb|right|An animation of Spitzer Space Telescope trajectory relative to Earth.<br>{{legend2|magenta| Spitzer Space Telescope }}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| RoyalBlue |[[Earth]]}}]]\nOne of the most important advances of this redesign was an '''Earth-trailing orbit'''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target -->.<ref name=nasa20070422/> Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T \u2248 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the [[NASA Deep Space Network]] for communications.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed by [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]].

Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted ''Spitzer''{{'s}} capabilities, as the NASA and [[ESA]] images do for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].\n\nAs one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, SST became the first telescope to directly capture light from [[exoplanet]]s, namely the \"hot Jupiters\" [[HD 209458 b]] and [[TrES-1b]], although it did not resolve that light into actual images.<ref>[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/189-ssc2005-09-NASA-s-Spitzer-Marks-Beginning-of-New-Age-of-Planetary-Science Press Release: NASA's Spitzer Marks Beginning of New Age of Planetary Science].</ref> This was the first time extrasolar planets had actually been visually seen; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that [[Cohen-kuhi Tau/4]] had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed.\n\n[[File:Comets Kick up Dust in Helix Nebula (PIA09178).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Helix Nebula]], blue shows infrared light of 3.6 to 4.5 micrometers, green shows infrared light of 5.8 to 8 micrometers, and red shows infrared light of 24 micrometers.]]\n\nWhile some time on the telescope is reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also have the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time. Important targets include forming stars ([[young stellar object]]s, or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies. Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes.\n\nIn 2004, it was reported that ''Spitzer'' had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen. The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as [[L1014]] which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO ([[Infrared Space Observatory]]), a predecessor to ''Spitzer''. The advanced technology of ''Spitzer'' revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.\n\nScientists from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by ''Spitzer''. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Young ''et al.'', 2004)\n\nIn 2005, astronomers from the [[University of Wisconsin System|University of Wisconsin]] at [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|Madison]] and [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater|Whitewater]] determined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that the [[Milky Way]] galaxy has a more substantial [[barred spiral galaxy|bar structure]] across its core than previously recognized.\n\n[[File:False-Color Image of Double Helix Nebula.jpg|thumb|upright|An artificial color image of the [[Double Helix Nebula]], thought to be generated at the galactic center by magnetic torsion 1000 times greater than the Sun's.]]\n\nAlso in 2005, astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]] and [[John C.

An image of a [[quasar]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] [[constellation]], intended only to help [[calibrate]] the telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed. Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after the [[Big Bang]], [[redshift]]ed by [[cosmic expansion]].<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 Infrared Glow of First Stars Found: Scientific American] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052138/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 |date=10 October 2007 }}.</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, astronomers reported an {{convert|80|ly|pc|lk=on|adj=mid|long}} nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the [[Double Helix Nebula]], which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting the [[supermassive black hole]] at the galaxy's center, {{convert|300|ly|pc}} from the nebula and {{convert|25000|ly|pc}} from Earth. This nebula was discovered by ''Spitzer'' and published in the magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 16 March 2006.\n\nIn May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature of [[HD 189733 b]], thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet.\n\nSince September 2006 the telescope participates in a series of surveys called the [[Gould Belt Survey]], observing the [[Gould Belt|Gould's Belt]] region in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope was completed from 21 September 2006 through 27 September. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] reported the discovery of [[Serpens south|Serpens South]], a cluster of 50 young stars in the [[Serpens]] constellation.\n\n[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] taken by MIPS at 24 micrometers.]]\n\nScientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System's outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet [[Wild 2]]. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K.\n\nIn May 2009, ''Spitzer'' researchers from Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature of [[forsterite]] silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by ''Spitzer'' in April 2008. These crystals were not present in ''Spitzer''{{'s}} previous observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi.<ref>[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2009-083 JPL News | Spitzer Catches Star Cooking Up Comet Crystals]</ref>\u00b7<ref>{{cite journal |last=\u00c1brah\u00e1m |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=Episodic formation of cometary material in the outburst of a young Sun-like star |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08004 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..224A |volume=459 |issue=7244 |pages=224\u2013226 |arxiv=0906.3161 |pmid=19444209}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8195467.stm BBC NEWS | Science & Environment | Traces of planet collision found]</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, astronomers Anne J.

Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the \"study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures.\"\n\nThe launch in January 1983 of the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology.\n\nEarlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based [[observatory|observatories]]. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared [[wavelength]]s or [[frequency|frequencies]], both the Earth's [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as [[IRAS]], the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and [[Infrared Space Observatory|ISO]], the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.\n\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal\n |image1  = Ksc arrive04.jpg\n |width1  = 120\n |caption1= The SIRTF in a Kennedy Space Center clean room.\n |image2  = 300th Delta launches with Spitzer.jpg\n |width2  = 154\n |caption2= The launch of SIRTF in 2003 aboard the 300th Delta rocket.\n}}\n\nMost of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments. It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard [[STS-51-F]] showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively \"dirty\" vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983, NASA was considering the \"possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/infrared/index.html |title=Studying the Universe in Infrared |accessdate=8 December 2007 |last=Watanabe |first=Susan |date=22 November 2007 |publisher=NASA}}</ref>\u00b7<ref>{{cite web |last=Kwok |first=Johnny |title=Finding a Way: The Spitzer Space Telescope Story |work=Academy Sharing Knowledge |publisher=NASA |url=http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php |date=Fall 2006 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908000438/http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=8 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n''Spitzer'' is the only one of the [[Great Observatories]] not launched by the [[Space Shuttle]], as was originally intended. However, after the 1986 [[STS-51-L|Challenger disaster]], the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] [[LH2]]\u2013[[LOX]] upper stage, which would have been required to place it in its final orbit, was banned from Shuttle use. The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission that could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle.\n[[File:Animation of Spitzer Space Telescope trajectory around Earth.gif|thumb|right|An animation of Spitzer Space Telescope trajectory relative to Earth.<br>{{legend2|magenta| Spitzer Space Telescope }}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| RoyalBlue |[[Earth]]}}]]\nOne of the most important advances of this redesign was an '''Earth-trailing orbit'''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target -->.<ref name=nasa20070422/> Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T \u2248 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the [[NASA Deep Space Network]] for communications.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed by [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions, the principals being Cornell, the University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Ball Aerospace, and Goddard Spaceflight Center. The shorter-wavelength infrared detectors were developed by Raytheon in Goleta, California. Raytheon used indium antimonide and a doped silicon detector in the creation of the infrared detectors. It is stated that these detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was once available at the beginning of the project during the 1980s.<ref>[http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=483065&highlight= Raytheon Company : Investor Relations : News Release].

Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted ''Spitzer''{{'s}} capabilities, as the NASA and [[ESA]] images do for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].\n\nAs one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, SST became the first telescope to directly capture light from [[exoplanet]]s, namely the \"hot Jupiters\" [[HD 209458 b]] and [[TrES-1b]], although it did not resolve that light into actual images.<ref>[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/189-ssc2005-09-NASA-s-Spitzer-Marks-Beginning-of-New-Age-of-Planetary-Science Press Release: NASA's Spitzer Marks Beginning of New Age of Planetary Science].</ref> This was the first time extrasolar planets had actually been visually seen; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that [[Cohen-kuhi Tau/4]] had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed.\n\n[[File:Comets Kick up Dust in Helix Nebula (PIA09178).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Helix Nebula]], blue shows infrared light of 3.6 to 4.5 micrometers, green shows infrared light of 5.8 to 8 micrometers, and red shows infrared light of 24 micrometers.]]\n\nWhile some time on the telescope is reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also have the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time. Important targets include forming stars ([[young stellar object]]s, or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies. Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes.\n\nIn 2004, it was reported that ''Spitzer'' had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen. The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as [[L1014]] which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO ([[Infrared Space Observatory]]), a predecessor to ''Spitzer''. The advanced technology of ''Spitzer'' revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.\n\nScientists from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by ''Spitzer''. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Young ''et al.'', 2004)\n\nIn 2005, astronomers from the [[University of Wisconsin System|University of Wisconsin]] at [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|Madison]] and [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater|Whitewater]] determined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that the [[Milky Way]] galaxy has a more substantial [[barred spiral galaxy|bar structure]] across its core than previously recognized.\n\n[[File:False-Color Image of Double Helix Nebula.jpg|thumb|upright|An artificial color image of the [[Double Helix Nebula]], thought to be generated at the galactic center by magnetic torsion 1000 times greater than the Sun's.]]\n\nAlso in 2005, astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]] and [[John C. Mather|John Mather]] of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] reported that one of ''Spitzer''{{'s}} earliest images may have captured the light of the first stars in the universe. An image of a [[quasar]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] [[constellation]], intended only to help [[calibrate]] the telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed. Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after the [[Big Bang]], [[redshift]]ed by [[cosmic expansion]].<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 Infrared Glow of First Stars Found: Scientific American] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052138/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 |date=10 October 2007 }}.</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, astronomers reported a {{convert|80|ly|pc|lk=on|adj=mid|long}} nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the [[Double Helix Nebula]], which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting the [[supermassive black hole]] at the galaxy's center, {{convert|300|ly|pc}} from the nebula and {{convert|25000|ly|pc}} from Earth. This nebula was discovered by ''Spitzer'' and published in the magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 16 March 2006.\n\nIn May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature of [[HD 189733 b]], thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet.\n\nSince September 2006 the telescope participates in a series of surveys called the [[Gould Belt Survey]], observing the [[Gould Belt|Gould's Belt]] region in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope was completed from 21 September 2006 through 27 September. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] reported the discovery of [[Serpens south|Serpens South]], a cluster of 50 young stars in the [[Serpens]] constellation.\n\n[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] taken by MIPS at 24 micrometers.]]\n\nScientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System's outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet [[Wild 2]]. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K.\n\nIn May 2009, ''Spitzer'' researchers from Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature of [[forsterite]] silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by ''Spitzer'' in April 2008. These crystals were not present in ''Spitzer''{{'s}} previous observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi.<ref>[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2009-083 JPL News | Spitzer Catches Star Cooking Up Comet Crystals]</ref>\u00b7<ref>{{cite journal |last=\u00c1brah\u00e1m |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=Episodic formation of cometary material in the outburst of a young Sun-like star |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08004 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..224A |volume=459 |issue=7244 |pages=224\u2013226 |arxiv=0906.3161 |pmid=19444209}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8195467.stm BBC NEWS | Science & Environment | Traces of planet collision found]</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, astronomers Anne J.

The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they are found in the molecular cloud where the temperatures are about {{convert|-170|C|K F}}. This led the team of astronomers to speculate that the [[bipolar outflow]] from the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star's surface to the chilly outer cloud.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer20110526_prt.htm NASA Mission News | Spitzer Sees Crystal Rain in Infant Star Outer Clouds]</ref>\u00b7<ref>{{cite journal |last=Poteet |first=C.

{"title_page": "Constituent (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[syntax|syntactic]] analysis, a '''constituent''' is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\n==Constituency Tests==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Substitution===\nThe substitution test enables to determine the type of phrase by replacing the relevant word, or string of words, with another one which belongs to the same category. Therefore, if a string S can be replaced by a single word, this is some evidence that S is a constituent.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Sportiche|first=Dominique|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis and Theory|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc|year=2014|isbn=9781405100168|location=|pages=67, 82, 83}}</ref>\n\nThe substitutions we are interested in replace a substring by a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original string did. Consider the following examples:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\n\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Substitution of a string by a word seems to indicate constituency. However, there is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents. Consider the following examples: \n\n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. Therefore, substitution by a string longer than one word is not necessarily one that preserves constituency. Regardless of that, string substitution failure is not a test for non-constituency.\n\n==== Coordination ====\nThe coordination test assumes that only constituents, of the same type, can be coordinated using conjunction words like ''and'', ''or'', and ''but''. Therefore, if a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase, this is some evidence that S is a constituent, a constituent of the same category as the word, or phrase, it is coordinated with.<ref name=\":0\" /> Consider the following examples which demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [beggars] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''beggars'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. On the other hand, let's briefly consider right node raising. When using coordination as a constituency test, it is likely to run into this type of construction. Sometimes it appears that a constituent can be shared by two coordinated constituents to its left.<ref name=\":0\" /> Consider the following examples:\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThe bolded elements are said to be \u201cright node raised\u201d. These data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. However, the additional data are problematic, since the analysis of right node raising constructions is controversial. \n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such. Consider the following examples:\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n====Proform substitution====\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===== Pronoun =====\n\n===== Proverb =====\n\n===== Proadjective =====\n\n===== Propreposition =====\n<br />\n====''Do-so''-substitution====\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.\n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n====''One''-substitution====\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')''\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n=== Displacement ===\n\n====Topicalization ====\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n====Clefting====\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n<br />\n\n====Pseudoclefting====\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n<br />\n\n==== Phrasal Movement (XP) ====\n\n=====Wh-fronting=====\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents. \n\n==== Head Movement (X) ====\n<br />\n====Right node raising (RNR)====\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''.\n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be.\n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''.\n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n<br />\n\n==== Heavy Shift ====\n<br />\n====Passivization====\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n<br />\n\n====Intrusion====\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n<br />\n\n===Deletion===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n<br />\n\n====Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)====\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n<br />\n\n==== Ellipsis ====\n\n===== Lexical Categories (open-class) =====\n<br />\n\n====== Noun Phrase ======\n\n======Verb Phrase ======\nThe Verb Phrase ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n====== Adjective Phrase ======\n<br />\n\n====== Prepositional Phrase ======\n\n===== Functional Categories (closed-class) =====\n<br />\n\n====== Determiner Phrase ======\n<br />\n\n====== Tensed Phrase ======\n<br />\n\n====== Complementizer Phrase ======\n<br />\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\n==Constituency Tests==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Substitution===\nThe substitution test enables to determine the type of phrase by replacing the relevant word, or string of words, with another one which belongs to the same category. Therefore, if a string S can be replaced by a single word, this is some evidence that S is a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche|first=Dominique|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis and Theory|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc|year=2014|isbn=9781405100168|location=|pages=82}}</ref>\n\nThe substitutions we are interested in replace a substring by a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original string did. Consider the following examples:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\n\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Substitution of a string by a word seems to indicate constituency. However, there is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents. Consider the following examples: \n\n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. Therefore, substitution by a string longer than one word is not necessarily one that preserves constituency. Regardless of that, string substitution failure is not a test for non-constituency.\n\n==== Coordination ====\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n====Proform substitution====\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===== Pronoun =====\n\n===== Proverb =====\n\n===== Proadjective =====\n\n===== Propreposition =====\n<br />\n====''Do-so''-substitution====\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.\n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n====''One''-substitution====\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')''\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n=== Displacement ===\n\n====Topicalization ====\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n====Clefting====\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n<br />\n\n====Pseudoclefting====\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n<br />\n\n==== Phrasal Movement (XP) ====\n\n=====Wh-fronting=====\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents. \n\n==== Head Movement (X) ====\n<br />\n====Right node raising (RNR)====\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''.\n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be.\n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''.\n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n<br />\n\n==== Heavy Shift ====\n<br />\n====Passivization====\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n<br />\n\n====Intrusion====\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n<br />\n\n===Deletion===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n<br />\n\n====Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)====\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n<br />\n\n==== Ellipsis ====\n\n===== Lexical Categories (open-class) =====\n<br />\n\n====== Noun Phrase ======\n\n======Verb Phrase ======\nThe Verb Phrase ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n====== Adjective Phrase ======\n<br />\n\n====== Prepositional Phrase ======\n\n===== Functional Categories (closed-class) =====\n<br />\n\n====== Determiner Phrase ======\n<br />\n\n====== Tensed Phrase ======\n<br />\n\n====== Complementizer Phrase ======\n<br />\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The regular [[wheelbase]] models were designated \"20\", while \"25\" referred to the longer version. Derived from the [[Isuzu Florian]], the Faster shared many components, including doors and the front-end assemblage. It served as a replacement for the [[Isuzu Bellett#Wasp|Isuzu Wasp]], a pickup version of the [[Isuzu Bellett|Bellett]] which preceded the Florian. Both single and twin headlamp front fascia designs were produced.\n\nDue to the exterior dimensions, and engines offered were found to be in compliance with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese regulations]], the platform was classed in the favorable \"compact\" designation, and competed with other Japanese made products sold in Japan at the time.\n\nIn most export markets, Isuzu rebranded the Faster as the \"Isuzu KB\".<ref name=Ruiz>[[#Ruiz (1986)|Ruiz (1986)]], p. 131.</ref> However, the Faster was often distributed through [[General Motors]] (GM) retail channels and sold under the [[Chevrolet]] brand as the \"[[Chevrolet LUV]]\"\u2014''LUV'' being an acronym for ''light utility vehicle''.<ref name = \"Chevrolet Colorado History\">{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/colorado/history.html |title=Chevrolet Colorado History |publisher=[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]] |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]], the European commercial vehicle subsidiary of GM also offered the vehicle under the \"Bedford KB\" name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/makkesgarage/brochures/broch42.html |title=Bedford KB (KB25) brochure (Europe, left-hand drive) |publisher=[[Bedford Vehicles]] |accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Isuzu Faster used a traditional pickup truck chassis with a ladder frame and a [[leaf spring]] [[live axle]] rear suspension. At the front, the A-arm suspension used an [[independent suspension|independent configuration]]. The {{convert|2600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase was similar to its competitors, as was the {{convert|1855|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} cargo bay.

Meanwhile, Isuzu had sold their version in parallel with the LUV since their 1981 entry to the US market, under the name \"Isuzu P'up\" (short for \"pickup\").

[[Isuzu Rodeo|Rodeo]] became the name used in most markets for this car, but the profusion of labels for different markets continued. Versions sold in the Americas were called '''Isuzu Pickup''' and '''Chevrolet LUV'''. In the United Kingdom, the pickup was called '''Isuzu TF''' and also '''Bedford Brava''' from 1988 until 1991 when the Bedford brand was dropped and it became the '''Vauxhall Brava'''. The Isuzu was also sold in mainland Europe along with the '''Opel Campo'''. This Opel branding was also utilized in the Middle East, parts of North Africa and some Asian countries.\n\n'''Holden Rodeo''' was the only name used in Australasia, with the '''Isuzu KB''' name used in South Africa and some other markets. The names '''Isuzu Faster-Z''', '''Isuzu TFR''', and '''Honda Tourmaster''' were used in Thailand. A Thai-market SUV based on the TF was sold as the Thairung Adventure, produced in [[knock-down kit|semi-knocked-down]] by [[Thai Rung Union Car]]. Names used in other markets include: '''Chevrolet T-Series''' (Egypt), '''Isuzu Ippon''' (Israel), '''Isuzu Fuego''' (Philippines), and as the '''Isuzu Invader''' in the north-eastern parts of Malaysia (Sabah). License built copies have been sold as the '''Jinbei SY10''' series, '''Foton Aoling T-Series''' in China, where the car has served as a basis for innumerable local copies, authorized and unauthorized.\n\nIn Japan, two-wheel drive versions were called \"Isuzu Faster\", with the \"Rodeo\" name reserved for four-wheel drive units. In 1992, an updated version of the [[List of Isuzu engines#4JB1|4JB1]] 2.8-litre turbodiesel with direct injection was introduced; while the original 2.8 has {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the direct-injected version offered {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|23.0|kgm|Nm lbft|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,300&nbsp;rpm. Japanese sales ended in 1994 without replacement, although export markets continued to receive the vehicle until replaced by the [[Isuzu D-Max|D-Max]] from 2002.\n\nThe TF series received a facelift in 1997. Styling was changed, with a more rounded look at the front, and a new-look dash similar to that used in the 1995 to 1997 model [[Isuzu Wizard]]. In China, where the TF is still built by Isuzu's local joint venture partner [[Qingling Motors]], it received a second facelift at the beginning of 2015.\n\n===Australia===\n\nHolden introduced the ''TF'' series into Australia in 1988, branded as the Holden Rodeo, following on from the name of the previous Isuzu based light truck sold by the brand in Australia. The Holden Rodeo was initially available with a 2.6-liter {{convert|88|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} inline-four. A 2.8-liter {{convert|74|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[turbodiesel]] was introduced soon after. Body styles offered were a two-door single cab, a two-door ''SpaceCab'', with space for two small jump-seats (rarely if ever fitted in Australia) behind the front passengers, and a four-door ''Crewcab'', with space for the driver and four passengers. Several trim levels were available, which included DX (base model), LX (mid-range RWD, top of the 4WD range) and LT (top of the range, only available as an RWD petrol Crewcab).\n\nThe facelifted 1997 (1998 model year) Holden Rodeo came with a new trim level, LT Sport, available as a four-wheel ''Crewcab'' only. Airbags for the driver and front passenger also became an option. By 1998 the 2.6-liter engine was discontinued and a new engine was offered, a 3.2-liter {{convert|140|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} V6. This engine was available in both rear- and four-wheel-drive. The rear-wheel-drive version had the same chassis, and thus ride-height as the four-wheel-drive, but without the transfer case and front axle. The 3.2-liter V6 was the most powerful engine in a [[pickup truck]] in Australia until it was replaced in 2003 by the new look Rodeo based on the [[Isuzu D-Max]]. Accordingly, this engine was the most popular engine in the Rodeo, and the Rodeo sold very well overall, near the sales numbers of the [[Toyota Hilux]], traditionally the best-selling commercial vehicle in Australia.\n\nThe Holden Rodeo was updated once again in 2001 for the 2002 model year, with a new diesel engine, a 3.1-liter {{convert|96|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] [[intercooled]] [[turbodiesel]]. The update was also accompanied by minor styling changes, such as clear indicator lenses, and a different grille.\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, the Isuzu was sold as the TF alongside the rebadged \"Opel Campo\". It was also sold as the \"Isuzu Campo.\" In the United Kingdom \"Vauxhall Brava\" badging was used rather than Opel. These received the same updates as did the Isuzu TF in general markets, and a variety of body styles were available, usually coupled with diesel engines.\n\n===North America===\nIn North America, the ''TF'' series appeared in 1988 as simply the \"Isuzu Pickup\". Produced at [[Lafayette, Indiana]], Isuzu continued on with the TF until 1996 when it was finally replaced with the [[Isuzu Hombre|Hombre]] (a badged-engineered [[Chevrolet S-10]]). The only engines available were the {{convert|96|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.3-liter [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu Z engine|4ZD1]], the {{convert|120|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 2.6-liter [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu Z engine|4ZE1]] and the GM 3.1-liter V-6 (designation LG6) producing {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for the '91\u2013'94 model years.<ref>[[General Motors 60\u00b0 V6 engine#Generation I]]</ref> The 2.3-liter version holds the distinction of becoming the last [[carburetor|carbureted]] passenger vehicle sold new in the United States (1994 model year). The truck continued to be sold in Mexico, and Latin America until production ended in 2016.\n\n===South America===\nAs with the previous ''KB'' series generation, South American markets again received the ''TF'' models under the \"[[Chevrolet LUV]]\" name. The Chilean assembling works began in 1982,<ref name=\"GM Arica\" /> meanwhile in Colombia commenced in 1989,<ref name=\"Chevrolet Luv 2.3\">[http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-481750 ''La Historia Paso A Paso 1989 Se Lanza el pick-up Chevrolet Luv 2.3'' / The History Step by Step. 1989 - The Chevrolet Luv 2.3 pick-up is launched] (in Spanish) / Accessed on 04/25/2018</ref> In the assembling process, the local parts usage percentage was high and important for the LUV manufacturing process.

From 1999 and to little success, [[Thai Rung Union Car]] supplied the Chevrolet plant in [[Arica]], Chile with the unique body panels from their \"Isuzu Grand Adventure\" model to make the ''[[Chevrolet Rodeo|Chevrolet Grand Adventure]]'' and the \"Chevrolet Grand LUV\". The Grand Adventure was a wagon version of the ''TF'' series pickup.\n\nBy the late 1980s, supplementary assembly began in [[Quito]], Ecuador by [[:es:General Motors OBB|Omnibus BB Transportes (now General Motors Ecuador)]] with a 1.6-liter inline-four cylinder engine, making {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn October 2005; was ceased the Isuzu Faster Chilean manufacture. In Colombia, the Isuzu Faster has ceased its production in 2010. The last Faster rolled off the assembly line on May 8, 2010. In both countries, the Isuzu Faster was replaced by the [[Isuzu D-Max]], these firsts units were assembled only in Ecuador and later from vehicles coming from Thailand (2014 onwards).\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 150\n| height = 80\n| lines = 3\n| File:1990 Isuzu Pickup 2WD, front left.jpg|1990 Isuzu Pickup regular cab, United States\n| File:1988-1990 Holden Rodeo (TF) DLX 2WD 2-door cab chassis (2011-04-28).jpg|1988\u20131990 Holden Rodeo 2-door cab chassis\n| File:1991-1992 Holden TF Rodeo DLX 2-door cab chassis 01.jpg|1991\u20131992 Holden Rodeo DLX 2-door cab chassis\n| File:2002 Holden Rodeo (TF MY02) LX 3.2 2WD 2-door cab chassis (2010-06-17).jpg | 2001\u20132003 Holden Rodeo LX 2-door cab chassis\n| File:1996 Opel Campo Crew Cab TFS54.jpg|1996 Opel Campo Crew Cab (TFS54)\n| File:Luv ls 3.2 2000.jpg|2000 Chevrolet LUV LS\n| File:Chevrolet Luv 3.2 Grand Wagon 4x4 2002 (9455145676).jpg|2003 Chevrolet Grand LUV wagon\n| File:Luv cargo 2004.jpg|2004 Chevrolet LUV Cargo\n| File:Luv v6 2005 4x4.jpg|2005 Chevrolet LUV\n| File:2000 Vauxhall Brava Di 4X4 2.5.jpg|1999 Vauxhall Brava\n| File:Isuzu TF facelift II 02 China 2016-04-03.jpg|2016 Qingling-Isuzu TF140 (second facelift)\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book |last=Bebbington |first=Terry |year=2009 |title=60 Years of Holden |location=[[Padstow, New South Wales]] |publisher=[[Haynes Manual]]s |isbn=1-876953-58-6 |ref=Bebbington (2009)}}\n* {{cite magazine |last=Lamm |first=Michael |date=July 1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59gDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q= |title=Driving the Isuzu I-Mark and P'up |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |location=[[New York City]] |ref=Lamm (1981)}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ruiz |first=Marco |title='The Complete History of the Japanese Car: 1907 to the Present |publisher=ERVIN srl |location=Rome |year=1986 |isbn=0-517-61777-3 |ref=Ruiz (1986)}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.luvtruck.com/ LUVTruck.com \u2014 Chevrolet LUV information and history]\n\n{{Isuzu cars timeline 1950\u20131979}}\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|Faster]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1972]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Isuzu Faster\n| image = Isuzu P'up -- 11-20-2011.jpg\n| caption = Second generation Isuzu P'up (U.S.)\n| manufacturer = [[Isuzu]]\n| aka = [[Chevrolet LUV]]\n| production = 1972\u20132002\n| class = [[pickup truck|Compact Pickup Truck]]\n| predecessor = [[Isuzu Bellett#Wasp|Isuzu Wasp]]\n| successor = [[Isuzu D-Max]]<br />[[Isuzu Hombre]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]]<br>[[Front-engine, four-wheel drive layout|Front-engine, four-wheel drive]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Isuzu Faster''' is a [[pick-up truck]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Isuzu]] between 1972 and 2002 over three generations.

The regular [[wheelbase]] models were designated \"20\", while \"25\" referred to the longer version. Derived from the [[Isuzu Florian]], the Faster shared many components, including doors and the front-end assemblage. It served as a replacement for the [[Isuzu Bellett#Wasp|Isuzu Wasp]], a pickup version of the [[Isuzu Bellett|Bellett]] which preceded the Florian. Both single and twin headlamp front fascia designs were produced.\n\nDue to the exterior dimensions, and engines offered were found to be in compliance with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese regulations]], the platform was classed in the favorable \"compact\" designation, and competed with other Japanese made products sold in Japan at the time.\n\nIn most export markets, Isuzu rebranded the Faster as the \"Isuzu KB\".<ref name=Ruiz>[[#Ruiz (1986)|Ruiz (1986)]], p. 131.</ref> However, the Faster was often distributed through [[General Motors]] (GM) retail channels and sold under the [[Chevrolet]] brand as the \"[[Chevrolet LUV]]\"\u2014''LUV'' being an acronym for ''light utility vehicle''.<ref name = \"Chevrolet Colorado History\">{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/colorado/history.html |title=Chevrolet Colorado History |publisher=[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]] |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]], the European commercial vehicle subsidiary of GM also offered the vehicle under the \"Bedford KB\" name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/makkesgarage/brochures/broch42.html |title=Bedford KB (KB25) brochure (Europe, left-hand drive) |publisher=[[Bedford Vehicles]] |accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Isuzu Faster used a traditional pickup truck chassis with a ladder frame and a [[leaf spring]] [[live axle]] rear suspension. At the front, the A-arm suspension used an [[independent suspension|independent configuration]]. The {{convert|2600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase was similar to its competitors, as was the {{convert|1855|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} cargo bay. Unlike for the preceding [[Isuzu Bellett#Wasp|Wasp]], there was also a long wheelbase version (''KB25'') which had {{convert|2995|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} between the axles, which made for a {{convert|2290|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bed.<ref name=\"KBandKBD\">{{citation |title=The Isuzu KB pick-up.

These were also badged as Holdens.\n\n===Europe===\nThe second generation KB was introduced in many European markets, not only Britain, as the '''Bedford KB'''. In subsequent years continental markets saw a switch to Isuzu badging as General Motors stopped using the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] brands outside of the United Kingdom.<ref name=TV218240>{{cite magazine | title = Pickup f\u00f6r skogsfolk | trans-title = Pickup for the forest dwellers | ref = TVn21 | language = Swedish | magazine = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 40 | date = 1982-10-06 | issue = 21 | volume = 34 | first = Bj\u00f6rn | last = Sundfeldt }}</ref> It was called by the model code,  Specifications and trims varied depending on market needs, but most received the 1.6-liter [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu G engine|G161Z]] petrol engine with a twin carburettor and {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, or the 2-liter [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu C engine|C190]] diesel inline-four with {{convert|54.5|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The gasoline engine remained the same, but the LUV was now available with an Isuzu ''C223'' diesel engine making {{convert|58|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4300&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|93|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2200&nbsp;rpm. This new engine gave the rear-wheel drive diesel LUV a fuel economy rating of {{convert|33|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city / {{convert|44|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway.\n\nAfter the 1982 model year, General Motors stopped selling the Chevrolet LUV (although many '82s lingered on forecourts into the next year) in the United States in favor of their own [[Chevrolet S-10|S-10]] compact pickup. Meanwhile, Isuzu had sold their version in parallel with the LUV since their 1981 entry to the US market, under the name \"Isuzu P'up\" (short for \"pickup\"). Isuzu's version received another grille and other differences to set it apart from the LUV, not the least of which is the giant \"ISUZU\" block letters on the tailgate.<ref name=\"puptest\" /> The P'up received the same engines as the LUV; either a {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.8-liter gasoline inline-four (''G180Z'') or a 2.2-liter diesel version with {{convert|58|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (''C223''). Four-wheel drive was available with either engine but only in short-wheelbase form,<ref>[[#Lamm (1981)|Lamm (1981)]], p. 108.</ref> though some 4WD long-wheelbase diesel are known to exist, possibly dealer-installed or aftermarket conversions. Because of technology-sharing agreement between GM and Isuzu, the diesel was also offered with the LUV's [[Chevrolet S-10|replacement]] until 1985. Production for the Mexican and Latin American markets did not end until 1994.\n\n===South America===\nAs with North America, the Isuzu KB was generally issued under the name \"Chevrolet LUV\" in South America. Manufactured in [[GM Colmotores|Colombia]] from Japanese [[complete knock down]] (CKD) sets, these models entered production in 1980 to be exported to other South American countries, continuing on until the release of the ''TF'' series in 1988. At the start, the versions assembled were the ''K-26'' and ''K-28''.

[[Isuzu Rodeo|Rodeo]] became the name used in most markets for this car, but the profusion of labels for different markets continued. Versions sold in the Americas were called '''Isuzu Pickup''' and '''Chevrolet LUV'''. In the United Kingdom, the pickup was called '''Isuzu TF''' and also '''Bedford Brava''' from 1988 until 1991 when the Bedford brand was dropped and it became the '''Vauxhall Brava'''. The Isuzu was also sold in mainland Europe along with the '''Opel Campo'''. This Opel branding was also utilized in the Middle East, parts of North Africa and some Asian countries.\n\n'''Holden Rodeo''' was the only name used in Australasia, with the '''Isuzu KB''' name used in South Africa and some other markets. The names '''Isuzu Faster-Z''', '''Isuzu TFR''', and '''Honda Tourmaster''' were used in Thailand. A Thai-market SUV based on the TF was sold as the Thairung Adventure, produced in [[knock-down kit|semi-knocked-down]] by [[Thai Rung Union Car]]. Names used in other markets include: '''Chevrolet T-Series''' (Egypt), '''Isuzu Ippon''' (Israel), '''Isuzu Fuego''' (Philippines), and as the '''Isuzu Invader''' in the north-eastern parts of Malaysia (Sabah). License built copies have been sold as the '''Jinbei SY10''' series, '''Foton Aoling T-Series''' in China, where the car has served as a basis for innumerable local copies, authorized and unauthorized.\n\nIn Japan, two-wheel drive versions were called \"Isuzu Faster\", with the \"Rodeo\" name reserved for four-wheel drive units. In 1992, an updated version of the [[List of Isuzu engines#4JB1|4JB1]] 2.8-litre turbodiesel with direct injection was introduced; while the original 2.8 has {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the direct-injected version offered {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|23.0|kgm|Nm lbft|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,300&nbsp;rpm. Japanese sales ended in 1994 without replacement, although export markets continued to receive the vehicle until replaced by the [[Isuzu D-Max|D-Max]] from 2002.\n\nThe TF series received a facelift in 1997. Styling was changed, with a more rounded look at the front, and a new-look dash similar to that used in the 1995 to 1997 model [[Isuzu Wizard]]. In China, where the TF is still built by Isuzu's local joint venture partner [[Qingling Motors]], it received a second facelift at the beginning of 2015.\n\n===Australia===\n\nHolden introduced the ''TF'' series into Australia in 1988, branded as the Holden Rodeo, following on from the name of the previous Isuzu based light truck sold by the brand in Australia. The Holden Rodeo was initially available with a 2.6-liter {{convert|88|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} inline-four. A 2.8-liter {{convert|74|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[turbodiesel]] was introduced soon after. Body styles offered were a two-door single cab, a two-door ''SpaceCab'', with space for two small jump-seats (rarely if ever fitted in Australia) behind the front passengers, and a four-door ''Crewcab'', with space for the driver and four passengers. Several trim levels were available, which included DX (base model), LX (mid-range RWD, top of the 4WD range) and LT (top of the range, only available as an RWD petrol Crewcab).\n\nThe facelifted 1997 (1998 model year) Holden Rodeo came with a new trim level, LT Sport, available as a four-wheel ''Crewcab'' only. Airbags for the driver and front passenger also became an option. By 1998 the 2.6-liter engine was discontinued and a new engine was offered, a 3.2-liter {{convert|140|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} V6. This engine was available in both rear- and four-wheel-drive. The rear-wheel-drive version had the same chassis, and thus ride-height as the four-wheel-drive, but without the transfer case and front axle. The 3.2-liter V6 was the most powerful engine in a [[pickup truck]] in Australia until it was replaced in 2003 by the new look Rodeo based on the [[Isuzu D-Max]]. Accordingly, this engine was the most popular engine in the Rodeo, and the Rodeo sold very well overall, near the sales numbers of the [[Toyota Hilux]], traditionally the best-selling commercial vehicle in Australia.\n\nThe Holden Rodeo was updated once again in 2001 for the 2002 model year, with a new diesel engine, a 3.1-liter {{convert|96|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] [[intercooled]] [[turbodiesel]]. The update was also accompanied by minor styling changes, such as clear indicator lenses, and a different grille.\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, the Isuzu was sold as the TF alongside the rebadged \"Opel Campo\". It was also sold as the \"Isuzu Campo.\" In the United Kingdom \"Vauxhall Brava\" badging was used rather than Opel. These received the same updates as did the Isuzu TF in general markets, and a variety of body styles were available, usually coupled with diesel engines.\n\n===North America===\nIn North America, the ''TF'' series appeared in 1988 as simply the \"Isuzu Pickup\". Produced at [[Lafayette, Indiana]], Isuzu continued on with the TF until 1996 when it was finally replaced with the [[Isuzu Hombre|Hombre]] (a badged-engineered [[Chevrolet S-10]]). The only engines available were the {{convert|96|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.3-liter [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu Z engine|4ZD1]], the {{convert|120|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 2.6-liter [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu Z engine|4ZE1]] and the GM 3.1-liter V-6 (designation LG6) producing {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for the '91\u2013'94 model years.<ref>[[General Motors 60\u00b0 V6 engine#Generation I]]</ref> The 2.3-liter version holds the distinction of becoming the last [[carburetor|carbureted]] passenger vehicle sold new in the United States (1994 model year). The truck continued to be sold in Mexico, and Latin America until production ended in 2016.\n\n===South America===\nAs with the previous ''KB'' series generation, South American markets again received the ''TF'' models under the \"[[Chevrolet LUV]]\" name. The Chilean assembling works began in 1982,<ref name=\"GM Arica\" /> meanwhile in Colombia commenced in 1989,<ref name=\"Chevrolet Luv 2.3\">[http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-481750 ''La Historia Paso A Paso 1989 Se Lanza el pick-up Chevrolet Luv 2.3'' / The History Step by Step. 1989 - The Chevrolet Luv 2.3 pick-up is launched] (in Spanish) / Accessed on 04/25/2018</ref> In the assembling process, the local parts usage percentage was high and important for the LUV manufacturing process.

From 1999 and to little success, [[Thai Rung Union Car]] supplied the Chevrolet plant in [[Arica]], Chile with the unique body panels from their \"Isuzu Grand Adventure\" model to make the ''[[Chevrolet Rodeo|Chevrolet Grand Adventure]]'' and the \"Chevrolet Grand LUV\". The Grand Adventure was a wagon version of the ''TF'' series pickup.\n\nBy the late 1980s, supplementary assembly began in [[Quito]], Ecuador by [[:es:General Motors OBB|Omnibus BB Transportes (now General Motors Ecuador)]] with a 1.6-liter inline-four cylinder engine, making {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn October 2005; was ceased the Isuzu Faster Chilean manufacture. In Colombia, the Isuzu Faster has ceased its production in 2010. The last Faster rolled off the assembly line on May 8, 2010. In both countries, the Isuzu Faster was replaced by the [[Isuzu D-Max]], these firsts units were assembled only in Ecuador and later from vehicles coming from Thailand (2014 onwards).\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 150\n| height = 80\n| lines = 3\n| File:1990 Isuzu Pickup 2WD, front left.jpg|1990 Isuzu Pickup regular cab, United States\n| File:1988-1990 Holden Rodeo (TF) DLX 2WD 2-door cab chassis (2011-04-28).jpg|1988\u20131990 Holden Rodeo 2-door cab chassis\n| File:1991-1992 Holden TF Rodeo DLX 2-door cab chassis 01.jpg|1991\u20131992 Holden Rodeo DLX 2-door cab chassis\n| File:2002 Holden Rodeo (TF MY02) LX 3.2 2WD 2-door cab chassis (2010-06-17).jpg | 2001\u20132003 Holden Rodeo LX 2-door cab chassis\n| File:1996 Opel Campo Crew Cab TFS54.jpg|1996 Opel Campo Crew Cab (TFS54)\n| File:Luv ls 3.2 2000.jpg|2000 Chevrolet LUV LS\n| File:Chevrolet Luv 3.2 Grand Wagon 4x4 2002 (9455145676).jpg|2003 Chevrolet Grand LUV wagon\n| File:Luv cargo 2004.jpg|2004 Chevrolet LUV Cargo\n| File:Luv v6 2005 4x4.jpg|2005 Chevrolet LUV\n| File:2000 Vauxhall Brava Di 4X4 2.5.jpg|1999 Vauxhall Brava\n| File:Isuzu TF facelift II 02 China 2016-04-03.jpg|2016 Qingling-Isuzu TF140 (second facelift)\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book |last=Bebbington |first=Terry |year=2009 |title=60 Years of Holden |location=[[Padstow, New South Wales]] |publisher=[[Haynes Manual]]s |isbn=1-876953-58-6 |ref=Bebbington (2009)}}\n* {{cite magazine |last=Lamm |first=Michael |date=July 1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59gDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q= |title=Driving the Isuzu I-Mark and P'up |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |location=[[New York City]] |ref=Lamm (1981)}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ruiz |first=Marco |title='The Complete History of the Japanese Car: 1907 to the Present |publisher=ERVIN srl |location=Rome |year=1986 |isbn=0-517-61777-3 |ref=Ruiz (1986)}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.luvtruck.com/ LUVTruck.com \u2014 Chevrolet LUV information and history]\n\n{{Isuzu cars timeline 1950\u20131979}}\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|Faster]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1972]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNorth America:clean up, replaced: a {{convert|8 \u2192  an {{convert|8", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu_Faster"}
