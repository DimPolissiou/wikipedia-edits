To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Marty asks Ruth to run the strip club over the Fourth of July weekend, which leads to him hiring her as the full time manager. She betters Bobby's management with actions, including hiring new staff, that turn Lickety Splitz into a moneymaker.

They warn Marty to stop church construction, with implied threats to Mason's pregnant wife Grace if Marty does not persuade him to resume boat-based services. Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made.

The result was a system of nationalized sexual slavery unique in modern times. Once again, women were regarded simply as commodities. Yoshida, a director of mobilization for Yamaguchi Prefecture during the war, spoke out in 1991 and published a book about the events.

His own order at that time was for 200 women for the 'Imperial Army Relaxation/Korean Women's Volunteer Corps.'

Everything went through proper channels, from the Cabinet to the Army Ministry and then to local governors and on to soldiers like Seiji Yoshida, whose job was to go on field trips to Korea, accompanied by subordinates and police officers, hunting for women to imprison in Imperial Army brothels. The result was a system of nationalized sexual slavery unique in modern times. Once again, women were regarded simply as commodities. Yoshida, a director of mobilization for Yamaguchi Prefecture during the war, spoke out in 1991 and published a book about the events. He had been only one of thousands of employees of the Patriotic Labour Association involved in conscripting labourers and sex slaves in the colonies.<sup>41</sup> After speaking out, Yoshida was denounced by veterans' associations and became the target of death threats.\"}}\n\nSome historians say the impact of the Yoshida's testimonies were minimal because they have been refuted and rejected by virtually all historians during the 1990s.

He has been called \"one of Canada's greatest poets and a leading figure in Jewish-Canadian culture.\"<ref name=\"Klein, Abraham Moses\">Usher Caplan, \"[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/am-klein/ Klein, Abraham Moses],\" ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1143.</ref>\n\nBest known for his poetry, Klein also published one [[novella]] entitled ''[[The Second Scroll]]'' in 1951, along with numerous essays, reviews, and short stories. Many of his lesser-known works, including several unfinished novels, were published posthumously in a series of collections from the [[University of Toronto Press]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and publications===\n\nKlein was born in [[Ratno]], [[Ukraine]], but in 1910 (at age one) he immigrated with his family to [[Montreal]], Quebec, the city in which he would live most of his life. Ratno had seen a series of [[pogroms]] and, like many Ukrainian Jews, Klein's parents sought a safer life elsewhere. As a result of the influx of Jewish immigrants to Montreal, its Jewish community flourished, even though many families lived close to the [[poverty line]]. The family of [[Irving Layton]] was another notable addition to this community. Klein's father, a devout [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], influenced Klein's early development. The son's early education and literary interests owed much to his plan to become a [[rabbi]] when he grew up, a plan that he never fulfilled.\n\nKlein attended [[Baron Byng High School]], an institution that would later be immortalized in [[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (book)|The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz]]''. There he became a friend of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], future leader of the socialist [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]].  Klein introduced Lewis to his wife, Sophie Carson, when they were all students at Baron Byng.<ref name=\"Lewis\">Smith (1989) pp. 146\u2013157</ref> (Lewis later introduced [[Irving Layton]] to Klein.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>  Klein became Layton's Latin tutor so he could pass his matriculation exams.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>)\n\nKlein went on to study political science, classics and economics as an undergraduate at [[McGill University]]. It was there that he met a group of poets and critics, including [[F. R. Scott]] and [[A. J. M. Smith]], who would form the foundations of the so-called [[Montreal Group|Montreal Group of Poets]]. Klein's first submission of a poem to the Scott and Smith-edited magazine, ''The McGill Fortnightly Review'', was rejected on the basis of its author's refusal to alter the word \"soul,\" which the editors felt was out of step with the [[modernism|modernist]] principles they espoused. Klein nevertheless became friends with the elder poets and was soon an avid modernist himself. After the ''Fortnightly Review'' folded, Klein and Lewis founded ''The McGilliad'' magazine at McGill in 1930.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>\n\nKlein also came under the influence of Montreal Group member [[Leon Edel]], the future [[Henry James]] biographer, who introduced Klein to the works of [[James Joyce]] and other writers. Klein would add Joyce to his list of lifelong fascinations, an interest that bore fruit in a complex literary study of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', published posthumously in the Klein volume ''Literary Essays and Reviews''.\n\nAfter McGill, Klein studied law at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], where instruction was in French. He was a law partner first of Max Garmaise, whom he followed briefly to Rouyn, a small mining development in the North of Quebec. Then, back in Montreal, he joined with Samuel Chait (who was to become first president of the [[Zionist Organization of Canada|Federated Zionist Organization of Canada]], when it was reorganised in 1967). Klein, Garmaise, and Chait had all been officers of Young Judea, a Zionist youth organization.\n\nIn spite of his growing literary interests, Klein's early poetry of the 1920s and 1930s was largely concerned with Jewish themes, including the history of Jews in Western society (\"Design for Mediaeval Tapestry\"), the importance of religion as a mediating force in modern society (\"Heirloom\"), and tributes to important figures in Jewish culture (\"Out of the Pulver and the Polished Lens,\" about the philosopher [[Spinoza]]). Klein published many of these early works in Canadian and American periodicals, although the [[Great Depression]] made it difficult for him to find a publisher willing to accept an entire book. He also published two poems in the 1936 anthology of modernist Canadian poetry, [[New Provinces (poetry anthology)|''New Provinces'']].\n\nBelatedly, in 1940, Klein's first [[monograph]], ''Hath Not a Jew'', was published in the United States. Although the book sold poorly, many of its poems would later become standard selections in anthologies of [[Canadian literature]] and posthumous collections of Klein's work.\n\n===Literary maturity and prominence===\n[[File:Abraham Moses Klein - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A. M. Klein standing in the [[Jewish Public Library (Montreal)|Jewish Public Library]], Montreal, in 1945]]\nDuring the Second World War, Klein published two more books, ''Poems'' and ''The Hitleriad'', both in 1944. ''Poems'' developed ideas forecast in ''Hath Not a Jew'' but also reflected Klein's anxieties over current events and the plight of Jews in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]. Poems such as \"Polish Village,\" \"Meditation Upon Survival,\" and \"Elegy\" were thoroughly contemporary accounts of persecution and suffering with which Klein, despite his relative safety in Canada, deeply sympathized. ''The Hitleriad'' was a very different work, a [[mock epic]] written in a satirical style reminiscent of [[Alexander Pope]] in such works as [[The Dunciad]]. In it, Klein attempted to satirize [[Adolf Hitler]] and his Nazi cohorts, although later critics often noted that the inescapable bitterness of the subject caused Klein's humorous intentions to run awry.\n\nKlein's greatest achievement as a poet came in 1948 with the publication of ''[[The Rocking Chair and Other Poems]]''. The book earned Klein a [[Governor General's Award]] in poetry and sold in numbers far exceeding the norm for a book of Canadian poetry. The success of the book owed much to Klein's new-found focus on domestic Canadian subjects, particularly the culture of [[French Canadians|French Canada]], which Klein, fluent in French and sympathetic to their minority status in North America, understood better than most [[English-Canadian]] writers of his day. Along with the oft-anthologized title poem, \"The Rocking Chair,\" a poem that uses the chair in a rural Quebec house as a [[synecdoche]] of French-Canadian heritage, the book included such poems as \"Lookout: Mont Royal,\" \"Grain Elevator,\" and \"The Cripples,\" all of which showed Klein at the height of his creative powers and survived long after as lyrical encapsulations of specific aspects and locations of Montreal. A lengthy [[elegy]] at the end of the book, \"Portrait of the Poet as Landscape,\" reflected Klein's indignation at the general indifference of the Canadian public to its own literature.\n\nKlein's mission to Israel in 1949 on behalf of ''The Canadian Jewish Chronicle'' inspired his last major work and only complete novel, ''[[The Second Scroll]]''. Taking cues equally from James Joyce, the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]], and the events of recent history, Klein structured his novel as a series of five chapters, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Deuteronomy]], each of which corresponds to one of the five books of the [[Pentateuch]]. The story's narrator, an unnamed character based loosely on Klein himself, goes in search of his long-lost uncle, Melech Davidson, a Holocaust survivor who drifts to [[Rome]] and then [[Casablanca]] before immigrating to Israel. Just as the narrator is about to catch up to his mercurial uncle, Davidson is murdered by a group of [[Arabs]], leaving the end of the novel open as to whether Davidson was a [[martyr]] to the Jewish nation or a false [[Messiah]] whose heroic status was inflated by his nephew's eagerness to meet his elusive uncle. Following the main narrative of ''The Second Scroll'' is a series of numbered [[Glosses to the Bible|gloss]]es that add further commentary to the narrative in the form of poems, a [[liturgy]], a [[Play (theatre)|playlet]], and, most notably, a meditative essay on the [[ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]] painted by [[Michelangelo]]. Although ''The Second Scroll'' was not a commercial success in its first edition from [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in [[New York City]], a subsequent [[re-print]] in Canada's [[New Canadian Library]] ensured its survival as one of the significant works of modern Canadian literature.\n\n===Klein as a public figure===\nAside from his writing, Klein was also an important member of the Montreal [[List of Canadian Jews|Jewish community]] during his lifetime. By profession he was a lawyer, and spent many years as a consultant and speech writer for [[Samuel Bronfman]], owner of the [[Seagram]] distillery. He was editor of the ''Canadian Jewish Chronicle'' from 1932 until 1955, a periodical to which he also contributed articles on such subjects as the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany, the social position of Jews in Canada, and the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Klein was a [[Zionist]] but his enthusiasm for the new Jewish state was tempered by a critical eye for political realities. This ambivalence toward Israel is best expressed in ''The Second Scroll'', which  he wrote after a fact-finding journey to Israel in 1949 and published two years later. Also in 1949, Klein ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian Parliament as a member of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]]. Increasing mental illness in the following years led to a suicide attempt and hospitalisation in 1952. In 1956, he was awarded the [[Lorne Pierce Medal]] by the [[Royal Society of Canada]], but by then he had lapsed into the mysterious silence that saw him give up writing altogether and become a [[recluse]] in his home in Montreal's [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]] district, until his death in 1972.\n\n==Legacy==\n''[[Canadian Encyclopedia|The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' states that \"Klein has rightly been called the 'first contributor of authentic Jewish poetry to the English language.' His writings articulate the feelings of a generation that witnessed the destruction of European Jewry and the fulfilment of the Zionist dream.\" <ref name=\"Klein, Abraham Moses\"/>\n\nFellow Jewish-Montrealer [[Leonard Cohen]] was an admirer who cited Klein as an influence and had written a couple of poems as well as a song, \"To a Teacher,\" in Klein's memory. [[Mordecai Richler]] is said to have used Klein as a model for the character L. B. Berger in ''[[Solomon Gursky Was Here]]'' (1989). He is honoured posthumously through the [[Quebec Writers' Federation Awards|A. M. Klein Prize for Poetry]], presented by the Quebec Writers' Federation. A play inspired by the poems and life of Klein was produced by Tableau D'H\u00f4te Theatre and presented at the Segal Centre for Performing Arts in Montr\u00e9al in February 2009.<ref>[http://www.qwf.org/awards/ Quebec Writers' Federation Awards]</ref>\n\nKlein was designated a [[Persons of National Historic Significance|Person of National Historic Significance]] by the federal government in 2007, and a plaque reflecting that status from the national [[National Historic Sites of Canada#Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada|Historic Sites and Monuments Board]] was unveiled in Montreal on November 19, 2017.<ref>[https://www.canada.ca/en/parks-canada/news/2017/11/the_government_ofcanadacommemoratesabrahammoseskleinandhirschwol.html The Government of Canada commemorates Abraham Moses Klein and Hirsch Wolofsky for their national historic significance], Parks Canada media advisory, November 19, 2017</ref> Klein's papers are preserved in the National Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa.\n\n==Publications==\n===Published during Klein's lifetime===\n* ''[[New Provinces (poetry anthology)|New Provinces: Poems of Various Authors]]'' (one of six authors in collection) Toronto: Macmillan, [[1936 in poetry|1936]].\n* ''Hath Not a Jew...''.

He has been called \"one of Canada's greatest poets and a leading figure in Jewish-Canadian culture.\"<ref name=\"Klein, Abraham Moses\">Usher Caplan, \"[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/am-klein/ Klein, Abraham Moses],\" ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1143.</ref>\n\nBest known for his poetry, Klein also published one [[novella]] entitled ''[[The Second Scroll]]'' in 1951, along with numerous essays, reviews, and short stories. Many of his lesser-known works, including several unfinished novels, were published posthumously in a series of collections from the [[University of Toronto Press]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and publications===\n\nKlein was born in [[Ratno]], [[Ukraine]], but in 1910 (at age one) he immigrated with his family to [[Montreal]], Quebec, the city in which he would live most of his life. Ratno had seen a series of [[pogroms]] and, like many Ukrainian Jews, Klein's parents sought a safer life elsewhere. As a result of the influx of Jewish immigrants to Montreal, its Jewish community flourished, even though many families lived close to the [[poverty line]]. The family of [[Irving Layton]] was another notable addition to this community. Klein's father, a devout [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], influenced Klein's early development. The son's early education and literary interests owed much to his plan to become a [[rabbi]] when he grew up, a plan that he never fulfilled.\n\nKlein attended [[Baron Byng High School]], an institution that would later be immortalized in [[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (book)|The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz]]''. There he became a friend of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], future leader of the socialist [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]].  Klein introduced Lewis to his wife, Sophie Carson, when they were all students at Baron Byng.<ref name=\"Lewis\">Smith (1989) pp. 146\u2013157</ref> (Lewis later introduced [[Irving Layton]] to Klein.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>  Klein became Layton's Latin tutor so he could pass his matriculation exams.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>)\n\nKlein went on to study political science, classics and economics as an undergraduate at [[McGill University]]. It was there that he met a group of poets and critics, including [[F. R. Scott]] and [[A. J. M. Smith]], who would form the foundations of the so-called [[Montreal Group|Montreal Group of Poets]]. Klein's first submission of a poem to the Scott and Smith-edited magazine, ''The McGill Fortnightly Review'', was rejected on the basis of its author's refusal to alter the word \"soul,\" which the editors felt was out of step with the [[modernism|modernist]] principles they espoused. Klein nevertheless became friends with the elder poets and was soon an avid modernist himself. After the ''Fortnightly Review'' folded, Klein and Lewis founded ''The McGilliad'' magazine at McGill in 1930.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>\n\nKlein also came under the influence of Montreal Group member [[Leon Edel]], the future [[Henry James]] biographer, who introduced Klein to the works of [[James Joyce]] and other writers. Klein would add Joyce to his list of lifelong fascinations, an interest that bore fruit in a complex literary study of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', published posthumously in the Klein volume ''Literary Essays and Reviews''.\n\nAfter McGill, Klein studied law at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], where instruction was in French. He was a law partner first of Max Garmaise, whom he followed briefly to Rouyn, a small mining development in the North of Quebec. Then, back in Montreal, he joined with Samuel Chait (who was to become first president of the [[Zionist Organization of Canada|Federated Zionist Organization of Canada]], when it was reorganised in 1967). Klein, Garmaise, and Chait had all been officers of Young Judea, a Zionist youth organization.\n\nIn spite of his growing literary interests, Klein's early poetry of the 1920s and 1930s was largely concerned with Jewish themes, including the history of Jews in Western society (\"Design for Mediaeval Tapestry\"), the importance of religion as a mediating force in modern society (\"Heirloom\"), and tributes to important figures in Jewish culture (\"Out of the Pulver and the Polished Lens,\" about the philosopher [[Spinoza]]). Klein published many of these early works in Canadian and American periodicals, although the [[Great Depression]] made it difficult for him to find a publisher willing to accept an entire book. He also published two poems in the 1936 anthology of modernist Canadian poetry, [[New Provinces (poetry anthology)|''New Provinces'']].\n\nBelatedly, in 1940, Klein's first [[monograph]], ''Hath Not a Jew'', was published in the United States. Although the book sold poorly, many of its poems would later become standard selections in anthologies of [[Canadian literature]] and posthumous collections of Klein's work.\n\n===Literary maturity and prominence===\n[[File:Abraham Moses Klein - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A. M. Klein standing in the [[Jewish Public Library (Montreal)|Jewish Public Library]], Montreal, in 1945]]\nDuring the Second World War, Klein published two more books, ''Poems'' and ''The Hitleriad'', both in 1944. ''Poems'' developed ideas forecast in ''Hath Not a Jew'' but also reflected Klein's anxieties over current events and the plight of Jews in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]. Poems such as \"Polish Village,\" \"Meditation Upon Survival,\" and \"Elegy\" were thoroughly contemporary accounts of persecution and suffering with which Klein, despite his relative safety in Canada, deeply sympathized. ''The Hitleriad'' was a very different work, a [[mock epic]] written in a satirical style reminiscent of [[Alexander Pope]] in such works as [[The Dunciad]]. In it, Klein attempted to satirize [[Adolf Hitler]] and his Nazi cohorts, although later critics often noted that the inescapable bitterness of the subject caused Klein's humorous intentions to run awry.\n\nKlein's greatest achievement as a poet came in 1948 with the publication of ''[[The Rocking Chair and Other Poems]]''. The book earned Klein a [[Governor General's Award]] in poetry and sold in numbers far exceeding the norm for a book of Canadian poetry. The success of the book owed much to Klein's new-found focus on domestic Canadian subjects, particularly the culture of [[French Canadians|French Canada]], which Klein, fluent in French and sympathetic to their minority status in North America, understood better than most [[English-Canadian]] writers of his day. Along with the oft-anthologized title poem, \"The Rocking Chair,\" a poem that uses the chair in a rural Quebec house as a [[synecdoche]] of French-Canadian heritage, the book included such poems as \"Lookout: Mont Royal,\" \"Grain Elevator,\" and \"The Cripples,\" all of which showed Klein at the height of his creative powers and survived long after as lyrical encapsulations of specific aspects and locations of Montreal. A lengthy [[elegy]] at the end of the book, \"Portrait of the Poet as Landscape,\" reflected Klein's indignation at the general indifference of the Canadian public to its own literature.\n\nKlein's mission to Israel in 1949 on behalf of ''The Canadian Jewish Chronicle'' inspired his last major work and only complete novel, ''[[The Second Scroll]]''. Taking cues equally from James Joyce, the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]], and the events of recent history, Klein structured his novel as a series of five chapters, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Deuteronomy]], each of which corresponds to one of the five books of the [[Pentateuch]]. The story's narrator, an unnamed character based loosely on Klein himself, goes in search of his long-lost uncle, Melech Davidson, a Holocaust survivor who drifts to [[Rome]] and then [[Casablanca]] before immigrating to Israel. Just as the narrator is about to catch up to his mercurial uncle, Davidson is murdered by a group of [[Arabs]], leaving the end of the novel open as to whether Davidson was a [[martyr]] to the Jewish nation or a false [[Messiah]] whose heroic status was inflated by his nephew's eagerness to meet his elusive uncle. Following the main narrative of ''The Second Scroll'' is a series of numbered [[Glosses to the Bible|gloss]]es that add further commentary to the narrative in the form of poems, a [[liturgy]], a [[Play (theatre)|playlet]], and, most notably, a meditative essay on the [[ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]] painted by [[Michelangelo]]. Although ''The Second Scroll'' was not a commercial success in its first edition from [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in [[New York City]], a subsequent [[re-print]] in Canada's [[New Canadian Library]] ensured its survival as one of the significant works of modern Canadian literature.\n\n===Klein as a public figure===\nAside from his writing, Klein was also an important member of the Montreal [[List of Canadian Jews|Jewish community]] during his lifetime. By profession he was a lawyer, and spent many years as a consultant and speech writer for [[Samuel Bronfman]], owner of the [[Seagram]] distillery. He was editor of the ''Canadian Jewish Chronicle'' from 1932 until 1955, a periodical to which he also contributed articles on such subjects as the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany, the social position of Jews in Canada, and the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Klein was a [[Zionist]] but his enthusiasm for the new Jewish state was tempered by a critical eye for political realities. This ambivalence toward Israel is best expressed in ''The Second Scroll'', which  he wrote after a fact-finding journey to Israel in 1949 and published two years later. Also in 1949, Klein ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian Parliament as a member of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]]. Increasing mental illness in the following years led to a suicide attempt and hospitalisation in 1952. In 1956, he was awarded the [[Lorne Pierce Medal]] by the [[Royal Society of Canada]], but by then he had lapsed into the mysterious silence that saw him give up writing altogether and become a [[recluse]] in his home in Montreal's [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]] district, until his death in 1972.\n\n==Legacy==\n''[[Canadian Encyclopedia|The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' states that \"Klein has rightly been called the 'first contributor of authentic Jewish poetry to the English language.' His writings articulate the feelings of a generation that witnessed the destruction of European Jewry and the fulfilment of the Zionist dream.\" <ref name=\"Klein, Abraham Moses\"/>\n\nFellow Jewish-Montrealer [[Leonard Cohen]] was an admirer who cited Klein as an influence and had written a couple of poems as well as a song, \"To a Teacher,\" in Klein's memory. [[Mordecai Richler]] is said to have used Klein as a model for the character L. B. Berger in ''[[Solomon Gursky Was Here]]'' (1989). He is honoured posthumously through the [[Quebec Writers' Federation Awards|A. M. Klein Prize for Poetry]], presented by the Quebec Writers' Federation. A play inspired by the poems and life of Klein was produced by Tableau D'H\u00f4te Theatre and presented at the Segal Centre for Performing Arts in Montr\u00e9al in February 2009.<ref>[http://www.qwf.org/awards/ Quebec Writers' Federation Awards]</ref>\n\nKlein was designated a [[Persons of National Historic Significance|Person of National Historic Significance]] by the federal government in 2007, and a plaque reflecting that status from the national [[National Historic Sites of Canada#Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada|Historic Sites and Monuments Board]] was unveiled in Montreal on November 19, 2017.<ref>[https://www.canada.ca/en/parks-canada/news/2017/11/the_government_ofcanadacommemoratesabrahammoseskleinandhirschwol.html The Government of Canada commemorates Abraham Moses Klein and Hirsch Wolofsky for their national historic significance], Parks Canada media advisory, November 19, 2017</ref> Klein's papers are preserved in the National Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa.\n\n==Publications==\n===Published during Klein's lifetime===\n* ''[[New Provinces (poetry anthology)|New Provinces: Poems of Various Authors]]'' (one of six authors in collection) Toronto: Macmillan, [[1936 in poetry|1936]].\n* ''Hath Not a Jew...''.

Two subsets of consonants, however, deserve further comment.\n\n===Emphatics===\nThe sounds notated here as \"[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]\" occur in nearly all Semitic languages as well as in most other [[Afroasiatic]] languages, and they are generally reconstructed as [[glottalized]] in Proto-Semitic.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cantineau |first=J. |year=1952 |title=Le consonantisme du s\u00e9mitique |journal=Semitica |pages=79\u201394 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>Kogan (2011), p. 61.</ref><ref group=\"nb\">That explains the lack of voicing distinction in the emphatic series, which would be unnecessary if the emphatics were pharyngealized.</ref> Thus, *\u1e6d, for example, represents {{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}. (See below for the fricatives/affricates).\n\nIn modern Semitic languages, emphatics are variously realized as [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngealized]] ([[Arabic]], [[Aramaic]], [[Tiberian Hebrew]] (such as {{IPA|[t\u02e4]}}), [[glottalized]] ([[Ethiopian Semitic languages]], [[Modern South Arabian]] languages such as {{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}), or as [[unaspirated]] ([[Turoyo]] of [[Tur-Abdin]] such as {{IPA|[t\u02ed]}});<ref>Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 29.</ref> [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] are exceptions and emphatics merge into plain consonants in various ways under the influence of [[Indo-European languages]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]/[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] for Maltese, [[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for Hebrew).\n\nAn emphatic labial *\u1e57 occurs in some Semitic languages, but it is unclear whether it was a phoneme in Proto-Semitic.\n*Hebrew developed an emphatic labial phoneme ''\u1e57'' to represent unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in Iranian and Greek.<ref>Hetzron 1997, p. 147.</ref>\n*Ge'ez is unique among Semitic languages for contrasting all three of {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/p\u02bc/}}.

The notation given here is traditional and is based on their pronunciation in Hebrew, which has traditionally been extrapolated to Proto-Semitic.  The notation {{transl|sem|*s\u2081}}, {{transl|sem|*s\u2082}}, {{transl|sem|*s\u2083}} is found primarily in the literature on [[Old South Arabian]], but more recently, it has been used by some authors to discuss Proto-Semitic to express a noncommittal view of the pronunciation of the sounds. However, the older transcription remains predominant in most literature, often even among scholars who either disagree with the traditional interpretation or remain noncommittal.<ref>For an example of an author using the traditional symbols but subscribing to the new sound values, see Hackett, Joe Ann. 2008. Phoenician and Punic. ''The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia'' (ed. Roger D. Woodard). Likewise, Huehnengard, John and Christopher Woods. 2008. Akkadian and Eblaite. ''The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Aksum'' (ed. Roger D. Woodard). p. 96: \"Similarly, there was a triad of affricates, voiced {{IPA|/\u1d48z/}} ({{angbr|z}}) voiceless {{IPA|/\u1d57s/}} ({{angbr|s}}), and emphatic {{IPA|/\u1d57s\u02bc/}} ({{angbr|{{transl|sem|*\u1e63}}}}). These became fricatives in later dialects; the voiceless member of this later, fricative set was pronounced [s] in Babylonian, but [\u0161] in Assyrian, while the reflex of Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*\u0161}}, which was probably simple [s] originally, continued to be pronounced as such in Assyrian, but as [\u0161] in Babylonian.\" Similarly, an author remaining undecided regarding the sound values of the sibilants will also use the conventional symbols, for example, [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg, Joseph]], The Patterning of Root Morphemes in Semitic. 1990. p. 379. ''On language: selected writings of Joseph H. Greenberg''. Ed. Keith M. Denning and Suzanne Kemme: \"There is great uncertainty regarding the phonetic values of ''s'', ''\u015b'', and ''\u0161'' in Proto-Semitic. I simply use them here as conventional transcriptions of the three sibilants corresponding to the sounds indicated by ''samekh'', ''\u015bin'', and ''\u0161in'' respectively in Hebrew orthography.\"</ref>\n\nThe traditional view, as expressed in the conventional transcription and still maintained by some of the authors in the field<ref>Lipi\u0144ski, Edward. 2000. Semitic languages: outline of a comparative grammar. e.g. the tables on p.113, p.131; also p.133: \"Common Semitic or Proto-Semitic has a voiceless fricative prepalatal or palato-alevolar ''\u0161'', i.e. {{IPA|[\u0283]}} ...\", p.129 ff.</ref><ref>Macdonald, M.C.A. 2008.

Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns. p. 25\u201340.</ref> is that {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} was a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|[\u0283]}}), {{transl|sem|*s}} was a [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] ({{IPA|[s]}}) and {{transl|sem|*\u015b}} was a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] ({{IPA|[\u026c]}}). Accordingly, {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} is seen as an emphatic version of {{transl|sem|*s}} ({{IPA|[s\u02bc]}}) {{transl|sem|*z}} as a voiced version of it ({{IPA|[z]}}) and {{transl|sem|*\u1e63\u0301}} as an emphatic version of {{transl|sem|*\u015b}} ({{IPA|[\u026c\u02bc]}}). The reconstruction of {{transl|sem|*\u015b \u1e63\u0301}} as lateral fricatives (or affricates) is certain although few modern languages preserve the sounds. The pronunciation of {{transl|sem|*\u015b \u1e63\u0301}} as {{IPA|[\u026c \u026c\u02bc]}} is still maintained in the [[Modern South Arabian languages]] (such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]]), and evidence of a former lateral pronunciation is evident in a number of other languages. For example, [[Biblical Hebrew]] ''ba\u015bam'' was borrowed into [[Ancient Greek]] as ''balsamon'' (hence English \"balsam\"), and the 8th-century Arab grammarian [[Sibawayh]] explicitly described the Arabic descendant of {{transl|sem|*\u1e63\u0301}}, now pronounced {{IPA|[d\u02e4]}} in the standard pronunciation or {{IPA|[\u00f0\u02e4]}} in Bedouin-influenced dialects, as a pharyngealized [[voiced lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[\u026e\u02e4]}}.<ref>{{citation|first=Charles|last=Ferguson|title=The Arabic Koine|journal=Language|volume=35|number=4|year=1959|page=630|doi=10.2307/410601}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation|first1=Kees|last1=Versteegh|title=The Arabic Language|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|isbn=90-04-17702-7}}\n</ref> (Compare Spanish ''[[wikt:alcalde#Spanish|alcalde]]'', from [[Andalusian Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0636\u0650\u064a}} ''al-q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b'' \"judge\".)\n\nThe primary disagreements concern whether the sounds were actually fricatives in Proto-Semitic or whether some were affricates and whether the sound designated {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} was pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (or similar) in Proto-Semitic, as the traditional view posits, or had the value of {{IPA|[s]}}. The issue of the nature of the \"emphatic\" consonants, discussed above, is partly related (but partly orthogonal) to the issues here as well.\n\nWith respect to the traditional view, there are two dimensions of \"minimal\" and \"maximal\" modifications made:\n\n#In how many sounds are taken to be [[Affricate consonant|affricate]]s. The \"minimal affricate\" position takes only the emphatic {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} as an affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bc]}}. The \"maximal affricate\" position additionally posits that {{transl|sem|*s *z}} were actually affricates {{IPA|[t\u0361s d\u0361z]}} while {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} was actually a simple fricative {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref>For example, Huehnengard, John. 2008. Afro-Asiatic. In: The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia (ed. Roger D. Woodard). P.229\u2013231</ref>\n#In whether to extend the affricate interpretation to the interdentals and laterals. The \"minimal extension\" position assumes that only the sibilants were affricates, and the other \"fricatives\" were in fact all fricatives, but the maximal update extends the same interpretation to the other sounds. Typically, that means that the \"minimal affricate, maximal extension\" position takes all and only the emphatics are taken as affricates: emphatic {{transl|sem|*\u1e63 \u03b8\u0323 \u1e63\u0301}} were {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bc t\u0361\u03b8\u02bc t\u0361\u026c\u02bc]}}. The \"maximal affricate, maximal extension\" position assumes not only the \"maximal affricate\" position for sibilants but also that non-emphatic {{transl|sem|*\u03b8 \u00f0 \u015b}} were actually affricates.\n\nAffricates in Proto-Semitic were proposed early on but met little acceptance until the work of Alice Faber (1981){{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} who challenged the older approach. The Semitic languages that have survived often have fricatives for these consonants. However, Ethiopic languages and Modern Hebrew, in many reading traditions, have an affricate for {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}}.<ref name=\"Dp33\" />\n\nThe evidence for the various affricate interpretations of the sibilants is direct evidence from transcriptions and structural evidence. However, the evidence for the \"maximal extension\" positions that extend affricate interpretations to non-sibilant \"fricatives\" is largely structural because of both the relative rarity of the interdentals and lateral obstruents among the attested Semitic language and the even-greater rarity of such sounds among the various languages in which Semitic words were transcribed. As a result, even when the sounds were transcribed, the resulting transcriptions may be difficult to interpret clearly.\n\nThe narrowest affricate view (only {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} was an affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bc]}}) is the most accepted one.<ref name=\"kogan-62\">Kogan, Leonid (2011). \"Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology\".

(A similar interpretation for at least Latin ''s'' has been proposed<ref>{{Citation|last=Vij\u016bnas|first=Aurelijus|year=2010|title=The Proto-Indo-European Sibilant */s/|journal=Historische Sprachforschung|volume=123|pages=40\u201355|url=https://www.academia.edu/6149816|place=G\u00f6ttingen|issn=0935-3518|doi=10.13109/hisp.2010.123.1.40}}</ref> by various linguists based on evidence of similar pronunciations of written ''s'' in a number of early medieval [[Romance languages]]; a technical term for this \"intermediate\" sibilant is [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]].)\n\nThere is also a good deal of internal evidence in early Akkadian for affricate realizations of {{transl|sem|s z \u1e63}}. Examples are that underlying ||{{transl|sem|*t, *d, *\u1e6d + *\u0161}}|| were realized as ''ss'', which is more natural if the law was phonetically ||{{transl|sem|*t, *d, *\u1e6d + *s}}|| \u2192 {{IPA|[tt\u0361s]}},<ref name=\"Dp32\"/> and that {{transl|sem|*s *z *\u1e63}} shift to {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} before {{transl|sem|*t}}, which is more naturally interpreted as deaffrication.<ref name=\"kogan-66\"/>\n\nEvidence for {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} as {{IPA|/s/}} also exists but is somewhat less clear. It has been suggested that it is cross-linguistically rare for languages with a single sibilant fricative to have {{IPA|[\u0283]}} as the sound and that {{IPA|[s]}} is more likely.<ref name=\"kogan-66\"/> Similarly, the use of Phoenician \ud802\udd14 {{transl|sem|*\u0161}}, as the source of Greek [[\u03a3]] ''s'', seems easiest to explain if the phoneme had the sound of {{IPA|[s]}} at the time. The occurrence of {{IPA|[\u0283]}} for {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} in a number of separate modern Semitic languages (such as [[Neo-Aramaic]], [[Modern South Arabian]], most Biblical Hebrew reading traditions) and Old Babylonian Akkadian is then suggested to result from a push-type [[chain shift]], and the change from {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} to {{IPA|[s]}} \"pushes\" {{IPA|[s]}} out of the way to {{IPA|[\u0283]}} in the languages in question, and a merger of the two to {{IPA|[s]}} occurs in various other languages such as Arabic and Ethiopian Semitic.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been suggested that the initial merged ''s'' in Arabic was actually a \"hissing-hushing sibilant\",<ref>Kogan (2011), p. 70, quoting Martinet 1953 p. 73 and Murtonen 1966 p. 138.</ref> presumably something like {{IPA|[\u0255]}} (or a \"retracted sibilant\"), which did not become {{IPA|[s]}} until later. That would suggest a value closer to {{IPA|[\u0255]}} (or a \"retracted sibilant\") or {{IPA|[\u0283]}} for Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} since {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} and {{IPA|[s]}} would almost certainly merge directly to [s]. Furthermore, there is various evidence to suggest that the sound {{IPA|[\u0283]}} for {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} existed while {{transl|sem|*s}} was still {{IPA|[ts]}}.<ref name=\"kogan-70\">Kogan (2011), p. 70.</ref> Examples are the Southern Old Babylonian form of Akkadian, which evidently had {{IPA|[\u0283]}} along with {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} as well as Egyptian transcriptions of early Canaanite words in which {{transl|sem|*\u0161 s}} are rendered as ''{{transl|sem|\u0161 \u1e6f}}''. (''\u1e6f'' is an affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}} and the consensus interpretation of ''\u0161'' is {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, as in Modern Coptic.<ref name=\"kogan-70\"/>)\n\nDiem (1974) suggested that the Canaanite sound change of {{transl|sem|*\u03b8}} \u2192 {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} would be more natural if *\u0161 was {{IPA|[s]}} than if it was {{IPA|[\u0283]}}. However, Kogan argues that, because {{transl|sem|*s}} was {{IPA|[ts]}} at the time, the change from {{transl|sem|*\u03b8}} to {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} is the most likely merger, regardless of the exact pronunciation of {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} while the shift was underway.<ref name=\"kogan-92-93\">Kogan (2011), pp. 92-93.</ref>\n\nEvidence for the affricate nature of the non-sibilants is based mostly on internal considerations. Ejective fricatives are quite rare cross-linguistically, and when a language has such sounds, it nearly always has {{IPA|[s\u02bc]}} so if {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} was actually affricate {{IPA|[ts\u02bc]}}, it would be extremely unusual if {{transl|sem|*\u03b8\u0323 \u1e63\u0301}} was fricative {{IPA|[\u03b8\u02bc \u026c\u02bc]}} rather than affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361\u03b8\u02bc t\u0361\u026c\u02bc]}}. According to Rodinson (1981) and Weninger (1998), the Greek placename ''M\u00e1tlia'', with ''tl'' used to render Ge'ez ''\u1e0d'' (Proto-Semitic ''*\u1e63\u0301''), is \"clear proof\" that this sound was affricated in [[Ge'ez]] and quite possibly in Proto-Semitic as well.<ref name=\"kogan-80\">Kogan (2011), p. 80.</ref>\n\nThe evidence for the most maximal interpretation, with all the interdentals and lateral obstruents being affricates, appears to be mostly structural: the system would be more symmetric if reconstructed that way.\n\nThe shift of {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} to ''h'' occurred in most Semitic languages (other than Akkadian, [[Minaean language|Minaian]], [[Qatabanian language|Qatabanian]]) in grammatical and pronominal morphemes, and it is unclear whether reduction of {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} began in a daughter proto-language or in Proto-Semitic itself. Some thus suggest that weakened {{transl|sem|*\u0161\u0320}} may have been a separate phoneme in Proto-Semitic.<ref>Dolgopolsky 1999, pp. 19, 69-70</ref>\n\n===Correspondence of sounds with daughter languages===\nSee [[Semitic languages#Phonology]] for a fuller discussion of the outcomes of the Proto-Semitic sounds in the various daughter languages.\n\n===Correspondence of sounds with other Afroasiatic languages===\n''See table at [[Proto-Afroasiatic language#Consonant correspondences]].''\n\n==Comparative vocabulary and reconstructed roots==\nSee [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_Proto-Semitic_stems appendix in Wiktionary]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afroasiatic languages]]\n*[[History of the alphabet]]\n*[[Proto-Afroasiatic language]]\n*[[Proto-Indo-European language]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=Fourth|location=Boston & New York|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2000|isbn=0-395-82517-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage0000unse_a1o7}}\n** John Huehnergard, ''Proto-Semitic Language and Culture'', pages 2056-2059\n** ''Semitic Roots'', pages 2062-2068\n*{{cite book|last=Lipi\u0144ski|first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC|accessdate=30 June 2013|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0815-4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Blench|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Blench|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C|accessdate=30 June 2013|year=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0466-2}}\n*Huehnergard, John.

Five such triads are reconstructed in Proto-Semitic:\n*[[Dental consonant|Dental]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s *d *t *\u1e6d\n*[[Velar consonant|Velar]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s *g *k *\u1e33 (normally written *g *k *q)\n*[[Dental consonant|Dental]] [[sibilant]]s *z *s *\u1e63\n*[[Interdental consonant|Interdental]] {{IPA|/\u00f0 \u03b8 \u03b8\u02bc/}} (written *\u1e0f *\u1e6f *\u1e71)\n*[[Lateral consonant|Lateral]] {{IPA|/l \u026c \u026c\u02bc/}} (normally written *l *\u015b *\u1e63\u0301)\n\nThe probable phonetic realization of most consonants is straightforward and is indicated in the table with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]. Two subsets of consonants, however, deserve further comment.\n\n===Emphatics===\nThe sounds notated here as \"[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]\" occur in nearly all Semitic languages as well as in most other [[Afroasiatic]] languages, and they are generally reconstructed as [[glottalized]] in Proto-Semitic.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cantineau |first=J. |year=1952 |title=Le consonantisme du s\u00e9mitique |journal=Semitica |pages=79\u201394 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>Kogan (2011), p. 61.</ref><ref group=\"nb\">That explains the lack of voicing distinction in the emphatic series, which would be unnecessary if the emphatics were pharyngealized.</ref> Thus, *\u1e6d, for example, represents {{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}. (See below for the fricatives/affricates).\n\nIn modern Semitic languages, emphatics are variously realized as [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngealized]] ([[Arabic]], [[Aramaic]], [[Tiberian Hebrew]] (such as {{IPA|[t\u02e4]}}), [[glottalized]] ([[Ethiopian Semitic languages]], [[Modern South Arabian]] languages such as {{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}), or as [[unaspirated]] ([[Turoyo]] of [[Tur-Abdin]] such as {{IPA|[t\u02ed]}});<ref>Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 29.</ref> [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] are exceptions and emphatics merge into plain consonants in various ways under the influence of [[Indo-European languages]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]/[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] for Maltese, [[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for Hebrew).\n\nAn emphatic labial *\u1e57 occurs in some Semitic languages, but it is unclear whether it was a phoneme in Proto-Semitic.\n*Hebrew developed an emphatic labial phoneme ''\u1e57'' to represent unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in Iranian and Greek.<ref>Hetzron 1997, p. 147.</ref>\n*Ge'ez is unique among Semitic languages for contrasting all three of {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/p\u02bc/}}.

The notation given here is traditional and is based on their pronunciation in Hebrew, which has traditionally been extrapolated to Proto-Semitic.  The notation {{transl|sem|*s\u2081}}, {{transl|sem|*s\u2082}}, {{transl|sem|*s\u2083}} is found primarily in the literature on [[Old South Arabian]], but more recently, it has been used by some authors to discuss Proto-Semitic to express a noncommittal view of the pronunciation of the sounds. However, the older transcription remains predominant in most literature, often even among scholars who either disagree with the traditional interpretation or remain noncommittal.<ref>For an example of an author using the traditional symbols but subscribing to the new sound values, see Hackett, Joe Ann. 2008. Phoenician and Punic. ''The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia'' (ed. Roger D. Woodard). Likewise, Huehnengard, John and Christopher Woods. 2008. Akkadian and Eblaite. ''The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Aksum'' (ed. Roger D. Woodard). p. 96: \"Similarly, there was a triad of affricates, voiced {{IPA|/\u1d48z/}} ({{angbr|z}}) voiceless {{IPA|/\u1d57s/}} ({{angbr|s}}), and emphatic {{IPA|/\u1d57s\u02bc/}} ({{angbr|{{transl|sem|*\u1e63}}}}). These became fricatives in later dialects; the voiceless member of this later, fricative set was pronounced [s] in Babylonian, but [\u0161] in Assyrian, while the reflex of Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*\u0161}}, which was probably simple [s] originally, continued to be pronounced as such in Assyrian, but as [\u0161] in Babylonian.\" Similarly, an author remaining undecided regarding the sound values of the sibilants will also use the conventional symbols, for example, [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg, Joseph]], The Patterning of Root Morphemes in Semitic. 1990. p. 379. ''On language: selected writings of Joseph H. Greenberg''. Ed. Keith M. Denning and Suzanne Kemme: \"There is great uncertainty regarding the phonetic values of ''s'', ''\u015b'', and ''\u0161'' in Proto-Semitic. I simply use them here as conventional transcriptions of the three sibilants corresponding to the sounds indicated by ''samekh'', ''\u015bin'', and ''\u0161in'' respectively in Hebrew orthography.\"</ref>\n\nThe traditional view, as expressed in the conventional transcription and still maintained by some of the authors in the field<ref>Lipi\u0144ski, Edward. 2000. Semitic languages: outline of a comparative grammar. e.g. the tables on p.113, p.131; also p.133: \"Common Semitic or Proto-Semitic has a voiceless fricative prepalatal or palato-alevolar ''\u0161'', i.e. {{IPA|[\u0283]}} ...\", p.129 ff.</ref><ref>Macdonald, M.C.A. 2008.

Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns. p. 25\u201340.</ref> is that {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} was a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|[\u0283]}}), {{transl|sem|*s}} was a [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] ({{IPA|[s]}}) and {{transl|sem|*\u015b}} was a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] ({{IPA|[\u026c]}}). Accordingly, {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} is seen as an emphatic version of {{transl|sem|*s}} ({{IPA|[s\u02bc]}}) {{transl|sem|*z}} as a voiced version of it ({{IPA|[z]}}) and {{transl|sem|*\u1e63\u0301}} as an emphatic version of {{transl|sem|*\u015b}} ({{IPA|[\u026c\u02bc]}}). The reconstruction of {{transl|sem|*\u015b \u1e63\u0301}} as lateral fricatives (or affricates) is certain although few modern languages preserve the sounds. The pronunciation of {{transl|sem|*\u015b \u1e63\u0301}} as {{IPA|[\u026c \u026c\u02bc]}} is still maintained in the [[Modern South Arabian languages]] (such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]]), and evidence of a former lateral pronunciation is evident in a number of other languages. For example, [[Biblical Hebrew]] ''ba\u015bam'' was borrowed into [[Ancient Greek]] as ''balsamon'' (hence English \"balsam\"), and the 8th-century Arab grammarian [[Sibawayh]] explicitly described the Arabic descendant of {{transl|sem|*\u1e63\u0301}}, now pronounced {{IPA|[d\u02e4]}} in the standard pronunciation or {{IPA|[\u00f0\u02e4]}} in Bedouin-influenced dialects, as a pharyngealized [[voiced lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[\u026e\u02e4]}}.<ref>{{citation|first=Charles|last=Ferguson|title=The Arabic Koine|journal=Language|volume=35|number=4|year=1959|page=630|doi=10.2307/410601}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation|first1=Kees|last1=Versteegh|title=The Arabic Language|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|isbn=90-04-17702-7}}\n</ref> (Compare Spanish ''[[wikt:alcalde#Spanish|alcalde]]'', from [[Andalusian Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0636\u0650\u064a}} ''al-q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b'' \"judge\".)\n\nThe primary disagreements concern whether the sounds were actually fricatives in Proto-Semitic or whether some were affricates and whether the sound designated {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} was pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (or similar) in Proto-Semitic, as the traditional view posits, or had the value of {{IPA|[s]}}. The issue of the nature of the \"emphatic\" consonants, discussed above, is partly related (but partly orthogonal) to the issues here as well.\n\nWith respect to the traditional view, there are two dimensions of \"minimal\" and \"maximal\" modifications made:\n\n#In how many sounds are taken to be [[Affricate consonant|affricate]]s. The \"minimal affricate\" position takes only the emphatic {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} as an affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bc]}}. The \"maximal affricate\" position additionally posits that {{transl|sem|*s *z}} were actually affricates {{IPA|[t\u0361s d\u0361z]}} while {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} was actually a simple fricative {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref>For example, Huehnengard, John. 2008. Afro-Asiatic. In: The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia (ed. Roger D. Woodard). P.229\u2013231</ref>\n#In whether to extend the affricate interpretation to the interdentals and laterals. The \"minimal extension\" position assumes that only the sibilants were affricates, and the other \"fricatives\" were in fact all fricatives, but the maximal update extends the same interpretation to the other sounds. Typically, that means that the \"minimal affricate, maximal extension\" position takes all and only the emphatics are taken as affricates: emphatic {{transl|sem|*\u1e63 \u03b8\u0323 \u1e63\u0301}} were {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bc t\u0361\u03b8\u02bc t\u0361\u026c\u02bc]}}. The \"maximal affricate, maximal extension\" position assumes not only the \"maximal affricate\" position for sibilants but also that non-emphatic {{transl|sem|*\u03b8 \u00f0 \u015b}} were actually affricates.\n\nAffricates in Proto-Semitic were proposed early on but met little acceptance until the work of Alice Faber (1981){{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} who challenged the older approach. The Semitic languages that have survived often have fricatives for these consonants. However, Ethiopic languages and Modern Hebrew, in many reading traditions, have an affricate for {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}}.<ref name=\"Dp33\" />\n\nThe evidence for the various affricate interpretations of the sibilants is direct evidence from transcriptions and structural evidence. However, the evidence for the \"maximal extension\" positions that extend affricate interpretations to non-sibilant \"fricatives\" is largely structural because of both the relative rarity of the interdentals and lateral obstruents among the attested Semitic language and the even-greater rarity of such sounds among the various languages in which Semitic words were transcribed. As a result, even when the sounds were transcribed, the resulting transcriptions may be difficult to interpret clearly.\n\nThe narrowest affricate view (only {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} was an affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bc]}}) is the most accepted one.<ref name=\"kogan-62\">Kogan, Leonid (2011). \"Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology\".

Examples are that underlying ||{{transl|sem|*t, *d, *\u1e6d + *\u0161}}|| were realized as ''ss'', which is more natural if the law was phonetically ||{{transl|sem|*t, *d, *\u1e6d + *s}}|| \u2192 {{IPA|[tt\u0361s]}},<ref name=\"Dp32\"/> and that {{transl|sem|*s *z *\u1e63}} shift to {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} before {{transl|sem|*t}}, which is more naturally interpreted as deaffrication.<ref name=\"kogan-66\"/>\n\nEvidence for {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} as {{IPA|/s/}} also exists but is somewhat less clear. It has been suggested that it is cross-linguistically rare for languages with a single sibilant fricative to have {{IPA|[\u0283]}} as the sound and that {{IPA|[s]}} is more likely.<ref name=\"kogan-66\"/> Similarly, the use of Phoenician \ud802\udd14 {{transl|sem|*\u0161}}, as the source of Greek [[\u03a3]] ''s'', seems easiest to explain if the phoneme had the sound of {{IPA|[s]}} at the time. The occurrence of {{IPA|[\u0283]}} for {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} in a number of separate modern Semitic languages (such as [[Neo-Aramaic]], [[Modern South Arabian]], most Biblical Hebrew reading traditions) and Old Babylonian Akkadian is then suggested to result from a push-type [[chain shift]], and the change from {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} to {{IPA|[s]}} \"pushes\" {{IPA|[s]}} out of the way to {{IPA|[\u0283]}} in the languages in question, and a merger of the two to {{IPA|[s]}} occurs in various other languages such as Arabic and Ethiopian Semitic.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been suggested that the initial merged ''s'' in Arabic was actually a \"hissing-hushing sibilant\",<ref>Kogan (2011), p. 70, quoting Martinet 1953 p. 73 and Murtonen 1966 p. 138.</ref> presumably something like {{IPA|[\u0255]}} (or a \"retracted sibilant\"), which did not become {{IPA|[s]}} until later. That would suggest a value closer to {{IPA|[\u0255]}} (or a \"retracted sibilant\") or {{IPA|[\u0283]}} for Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} since {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} and {{IPA|[s]}} would almost certainly merge directly to [s]. Furthermore, there is various evidence to suggest that the sound {{IPA|[\u0283]}} for {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} existed while {{transl|sem|*s}} was still {{IPA|[ts]}}.<ref name=\"kogan-70\">Kogan (2011), p. 70.</ref> Examples are the Southern Old Babylonian form of Akkadian, which evidently had {{IPA|[\u0283]}} along with {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}} as well as Egyptian transcriptions of early Canaanite words in which {{transl|sem|*\u0161 s}} are rendered as ''{{transl|sem|\u0161 \u1e6f}}''. (''\u1e6f'' is an affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}} and the consensus interpretation of ''\u0161'' is {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, as in Modern Coptic.<ref name=\"kogan-70\"/>)\n\nDiem (1974) suggested that the Canaanite sound change of {{transl|sem|*\u03b8}} \u2192 {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} would be more natural if *\u0161 was {{IPA|[s]}} than if it was {{IPA|[\u0283]}}. However, Kogan argues that, because {{transl|sem|*s}} was {{IPA|[ts]}} at the time, the change from {{transl|sem|*\u03b8}} to {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} is the most likely merger, regardless of the exact pronunciation of {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} while the shift was underway.<ref name=\"kogan-92-93\">Kogan (2011), pp. 92-93.</ref>\n\nEvidence for the affricate nature of the non-sibilants is based mostly on internal considerations. Ejective fricatives are quite rare cross-linguistically, and when a language has such sounds, it nearly always has {{IPA|[s\u02bc]}} so if {{transl|sem|*\u1e63}} was actually affricate {{IPA|[ts\u02bc]}}, it would be extremely unusual if {{transl|sem|*\u03b8\u0323 \u1e63\u0301}} was fricative {{IPA|[\u03b8\u02bc \u026c\u02bc]}} rather than affricate {{IPA|[t\u0361\u03b8\u02bc t\u0361\u026c\u02bc]}}. According to Rodinson (1981) and Weninger (1998), the Greek placename ''M\u00e1tlia'', with ''tl'' used to render Ge'ez ''\u1e0d'' (Proto-Semitic ''*\u1e63\u0301''), is \"clear proof\" that this sound was affricated in [[Ge'ez]] and quite possibly in Proto-Semitic as well.<ref name=\"kogan-80\">Kogan (2011), p. 80.</ref>\n\nThe evidence for the most maximal interpretation, with all the interdentals and lateral obstruents being affricates, appears to be mostly structural: the system would be more symmetric if reconstructed that way.\n\nThe shift of {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} to ''h'' occurred in most Semitic languages (other than Akkadian, [[Minaean language|Minaian]], [[Qatabanian language|Qatabanian]]) in grammatical and pronominal morphemes, and it is unclear whether reduction of {{transl|sem|*\u0161}} began in a daughter proto-language or in Proto-Semitic itself. Some thus suggest that weakened {{transl|sem|*\u0161\u0320}} may have been a separate phoneme in Proto-Semitic.<ref>Dolgopolsky 1999, pp. 19, 69-70</ref>\n\n===Correspondence of sounds with daughter languages===\nSee [[Semitic languages#Phonology]] for a fuller discussion of the outcomes of the Proto-Semitic sounds in the various daughter languages.\n\n===Correspondence of sounds with other Afroasiatic languages===\n''See table at [[Proto-Afroasiatic language#Consonant correspondences]].''\n\n==Comparative vocabulary and reconstructed roots==\nSee [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_Proto-Semitic_stems appendix in Wiktionary]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afroasiatic languages]]\n*[[History of the alphabet]]\n*[[Proto-Afroasiatic language]]\n*[[Proto-Indo-European language]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=Fourth|location=Boston & New York|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2000|isbn=0-395-82517-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage0000unse_a1o7}}\n** John Huehnergard, ''Proto-Semitic Language and Culture'', pages 2056-2059\n** ''Semitic Roots'', pages 2062-2068\n*{{cite book|last=Lipi\u0144ski|first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC|accessdate=30 June 2013|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0815-4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Blench|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Blench|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C|accessdate=30 June 2013|year=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0466-2}}\n*Huehnergard, John.

The middle line of the mid-channel flow (thalweg) of the [[Hariabhanga River]] established the original boundary between the states. Had the island not disappeared, the eventual determination of the island's sovereignty might have had a major impact over the location of the states' [[maritime boundary]] further offshore when it is negotiated between Bangladesh and India.\n\nThere is no available conclusive evidence as to which side of the island the main channel flowed, and it may have changed over time given shifting [[silt]] of the [[Sundarbans]] delta. India claimed that a 1981 detailed survey of water depths showed the main and much deeper channel and main flow on the east side of the island, which favored India. Similar survey data was printed on a 1990 [[British Admiralty]] chart and reprinted on the 1991 US [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) chart number 63330 Edition 9 at 1:300,000 scale.<ref>The NGA chart states: \"Users should refer corrections, additions, comments to NGA's Maritime Operations Desk toll free at 1-800-362-6289...See {{cite web |url=http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/dnc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527213344/http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/dnc/ |archivedate=2009-05-27 }} , or write to the NGA Maritime Division, Mail Stop D44, 4600 Sangamore Rd., Bethesda, MD 20816-5003.\" The chart cannot be posted on this site due to a UK Crown Copyright.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the Bangladeshi government claimed, as during [[Ziaur Rahman]]'s visit to India in the late 1970s, that data provided clearly showed the main current flow on the western side of the island's location, thus favoring Bangladesh.<ref>[http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/10/01/d31001020323.htm \"Sovereignty of South Talpatty island\"], ''Daily Star'', October 1, 2003</ref>\n\nUnder some [[international boundary]] precedents, the location of the channel in 1947 or at the time of the island's emergence may have been more relevant than its later location.

It is now under the waves of the [[Bay of Bengal]].\n\n==Dispute==\nThe island was claimed by both Bangladesh and India, although neither country established any permanent settlement there because of the island's geological instability based on silt deposits in a delta which floods every year. India had reportedly hoisted the [[Indian flag]] on the island in 1981 and established a temporary base of [[Border Security Forces]] (BSF), regularly visiting with naval gunships.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1817/18170730.htm Of Indo-Bangladesh distrust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326124740/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1817/18170730.htm |date=2009-03-26 }} by A.

The middle line of the mid-channel flow (thalweg) of the [[Hariabhanga River]] established the original boundary between the states. Had the island not disappeared, the eventual determination of the island's sovereignty might have had a major impact over the location of the states' [[maritime boundary]] further offshore when it is negotiated between Bangladesh and India.\n\nThere is no available conclusive evidence as to which side of the island the main channel flowed, and it may have changed over time given shifting [[silt]] of the [[Sundarbans]] delta. India claimed that a 1981 detailed survey of water depths showed the main and much deeper channel and main flow on the east side of the island, which favored India. Similar survey data was printed on a 1990 [[British Admiralty]] chart and reprinted on the 1991 US [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) chart number 63330 Edition 9 at 1:300,000 scale.<ref>The NGA chart states: \"Users should refer corrections, additions, comments to NGA's Maritime Operations Desk toll free at 1-800-362-6289...See {{cite web |url=http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/dnc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527213344/http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/dnc/ |archivedate=2009-05-27 }} , or write to the NGA Maritime Division, Mail Stop D44, 4600 Sangamore Rd., Bethesda, MD 20816-5003.\" The chart cannot be posted on this site due to a UK Crown Copyright.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the Bangladeshi government claimed, as during [[Ziaur Rahman]]'s visit to India in the late 1970s, that data provided clearly showed the main current flow on the western side of the island's location, thus favoring Bangladesh.<ref>[http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/10/01/d31001020323.htm \"Sovereignty of South Talpatty island\"], ''Daily Star'', October 1, 2003</ref>\n\nUnder some [[international boundary]] precedents, the location of the channel in 1947 or at the time of the island's emergence may have been more relevant than its later location.
